Holding that the electoral bonds scheme was &quot;unconstitutional and manifestly arbitrary&quot;, the Supreme Court directed the SBI on February 15 to furnish the complete details of the bonds purchased since April 12, 2019 to the EC, which would publish the information on its website by March 13. Holding that the electoral bonds scheme was &quot;unconstitutional and manifestly arbitrary&quot;, the Supreme Court directed the SBI on February 15 to furnish the complete details of the bonds purchased since April 12, 2019 to the EC, which would publish the information on its website by March 13.  On March 11, the court dismissed the SBI's petition seeking an extension of the deadline and ordered it to disclose the details of the electoral bonds to the EC by the close of business hours on March 12. RTI activist Commodore (retired) Lokesh Batra approached the SBI on March 13 seeking the complete data of the electoral bonds in the digital form, as provided to the EC after the Supreme Court's order.  The bank denied the information citing two exemption clauses given under the Right to Information (RTI) Act -- section 8(1)(e) that is related to records held in a fiduciary capacity and section 8(1)(j) that allows withholding personal information. &quot;Information sought by you is containing details of purchasers and political parties and hence, cannot be disclosed as it is held in fiduciary capacity disclosure of which is exempted under sections 8(1)(e) and (j) of the RTI Act,&quot; the response furnished by the central public information officer and deputy general manager of the SBI said on Wednesday.  Batra had also sought the details of the fees paid by the SBI to senior advocate Harish Salve to defend its case against the disclosure of the electoral bonds' records, citing that the records are held in a fiduciary capacity and the information is personal in nature. It is &quot;bizzare&quot; that the SBI denied the information that is already on the EC's website, Batra told PTI.  On the question of Salve's fee, he said the bank has denied information that involves taxpayers' money. The EC published the data furnished by the SBI on its website on March 14, with the details of the donors and political parties that redeemed the bonds.  On March 15, the apex court pulled up the SBI for not furnishing the complete information by withholding the numbers unique to each electoral bond that would help match the donors with the recipient political parties, saying the bank was &quot;duty-bound&quot; to reveal the information. A five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud said it had directed the disclosure of all the details of the bonds, including the names of the purchasers, amounts and dates of purchase.  All details have to be furnished by the SBI, the CJI observed, as the court admonished the bank for furnishing incomplete information, a day after the EC put out the entire list of entities that purchased the bonds for making political donations. The SBI had said a total of 22,217 electoral bonds of varying denominations were purchased by the donors between April 1, 2019 and February 15 this year, of which 22,030 were redeemed by political parties.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-refuses-to-disclose-electoral-bonds-details-under-rti-act-12622041.html

Paytm's UPI was powered by Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL) and since the RBI's action on the latter, the mobile payments company has been forced to seek bank partnerships to become a third party application provider (TPAP), much like its larger competitors PhonePe and Google Pay.  Moneycontrol reported that Paytm had partnered with Axis Bank, Yes Bank and HDFC Bank for TPAP partnerships earlier. For most large UPI players, the regulatory body National Payments Corporation of India insists that they should have at least three bank partners.  NPCI, which runs UPI payments, is working with all the banks to expedite the TPAP process by March 15.  SBI, Paytm and NPCI did not respond to Moneycontrol queries on the UPI partnership.  The bank partners in UPI are payment service providers (PSP), which connect the TPAP to the banking network. Since OCL already had a partnership with PPBL, it did not require other bank partners.  On February 23, RBI said customers and merchants having ‘@paytm’ handles are to be migrated seamlessly from PPBL to a set of newly identified banks to avoid any disruption.  Meanwhile, Moneycontrol reported that Paytm is in talks with Axis, Canara, Yes and Kotak Mahindra Bank to migrate merchant accounts from payments bank.  Third-party apps are heavily dependent on PSP banks when it comes to the speed of the payments or even ensuring that payment failures are kept to a minimum. Players like PhonePe and Google Pay typically have at least three bank partnerships to minimise risk.  PPBL has been the largest beneficiary bank in the UPI ecosystem over the last three years with over 20 percent market share in inbound credit transactions. Despite its scale, it was consistently among the banks with the lowest transaction failures.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/sbi-partners-with-paytm-as-the-fourth-bank-for-its-upi-business-12453801.html

The application had said due to stringent measures undertaken to ensure that the identity of the donors was kept anonymous, &quot;decoding&quot; the electoral bonds and matching the donors to the donations would be a complex process.  &quot;It submitted that the data related to the issuance of the bond and the data related to the redemption of the bond was kept recorded in two different silos. No central database was maintained,&quot; it had said.  &quot;It is submitted that donor details were kept in a sealed cover at the designated branches and all such sealed covers were deposited in the main branch of the applicant bank, which is located in Mumbai,&quot; it had said.

SBI,2024-03-13T14:38:01+05:30,TK Arun,Investigate possible use of electoral bonds for money laundering,"During an electoral bond’s 15-day life cycle, it can be used to conveniently move large amounts of anonymous money, settle shady transactions without leaving a money trail, and even channel money routed through shell companies to political parties. Riddled with such opportunities for money laundering, this allowed for a ready secondary market for electoral bonds. A fit case for investigation by central agencies exists","The Electoral Bond Scheme could, the RBI had warned, during the consultations prior to the announcement of the scheme, be used for money laundering, as the bonds were bearer instruments, scrips, which were valid regardless of who bought it, whether it changed hands, and which political party ultimately redeemed it.  The intense concern visible in some quarters, finding articulation in a demand by the All India Bar Association president for a presidential reference to the Supreme Court for reconsideration of its verdict outlawing electoral bonds, suggests that such fears expressed by the RBI might not have been groundless.  Cloak of Anonymity  The electoral bond is a bearer bond with a validity of 15 days, and encashable only by a recognised political party.  It had been introduced as an instrument to clean up political funding, notoriously taking place with unaccounted cash, taken off the books of companies. The electoral bonds, it had been argued by its backers, would allow money from legitimate, accounted-for sources to be routed to political parties, albeit anonymously.  This was always questionable. For one, much of political spending could never be done with accounted-for cash. There is the illegitimate activity, such as distributing cash and liquor on poll-eve, and the buying up of defector legislators. Then, there is the undignified expenditure, paying people to assemble as a crowd of enthusiastic supporters at political rallies. Then there is the legitimate activity that cannot be accounted for, because its scale exceeds the limits set by electoral law. So, electoral bonds could, at best, legitimise only a fraction of the funds going to a political party.  But electoral bonds could, by its very nature, also provide a means of laundering money —  a fear that had been raised by many, including a collective of non-profits called the Financial Action Task Force Platform.  The sight of a butterfly evokes a sensation of beauty in the average human. You do not think of its prior, ugly shapes in its life cycle as a caterpillar or chrysalis. When average voters see an electoral bond, its innovators hoped, they would see white money flowing into the coffers of a political party, and cheer. But the world is full of people who are drawn not so much to the multi-coloured wings that flap aesthetic goodness into the soul of the beholder as to the misshapen pupal form that precedes the sprouting of wings.  Electoral bonds have a pupal stage in its 15-day life, before it emerges as an accounted-for contribution on the books of a political party. During that stage, the cloak of anonymity in which it is shrouded, lends itself to many activities that make the electoral bond during its fortnight prior to handover to a political party extremely valuable, more valuable than the face value of the bond. The filaments of silk that form the cocoon of a silk moth are, of course, far more valuable to humans than the moth itself.  Money Laundering Avenues  During those anonymous 14 days, the bond could perform many functions, ranging from conveniently moving large amounts of anonymous money from City A to City B, and settling shady transactions between parties who do not want their financial dealings to enter any banking record, to channelling money routed through shell companies to political parties.  This suggests that a buyer of an electoral bond could have a ready secondary market that values the bond much higher than its face value. He could sell it on the secondary market and make a tidy profit. Or he could sell it, make a surplus, and give all of the proceeds as an off-the-books donation to the political leader he wants to curry favour with.  In theory, there could be multiple such transactions, before it is handed over to a political party. The premium on the bond would come down towards the end of its 15-day cycle, unless the bond is picked up by someone who has a lot of black money that has to be converted into white and decides to make a large contribution to the ruling party, hoping for putative protection from the prying eyes of investigative agencies, by virtue of that donation. Since there was built-in anonymity guaranteed at the time of bond purchase, such secondary sale posed little risk of exposure — there was no provision of public reconciliation between the buyer of the bond and the donor of the bond.  Whether the bonds issued over the life of the scheme were subjected to such misuse is right now only a matter of speculation. The identity of the final donors could offer a clue. A bond donated by a well-known corporate entity probably led a blameless life over its short lifespan. But that cannot be taken for granted for all the Rs 16,518 crore worth of bonds issued over 2018-24. Perhaps, the government should initiate an investigation into the possible use of electoral bonds as instruments of money laundering.  TK Arun is a senior journalist.

Commencing the crucial hearing, the bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud said it had asked the SBI to do a &quot;plain disclosure&quot; as per the court's judgment.

The broking firm also highlighted factors that would drive underperformance in public sector banks, compared to their private peers.  At 10.34am, shares of SBI traded 0.1 percent higher at Rs 788.95. The stock has gained over 33 percent in the past six months.  Bernstein said that although public sector banks have outshone private lenders in the past three years, going ahead, investors should switch to private sector banks. The broking firm sees a less promising trajectory for state-run banks as they struggle with weaker deposit growth and much lower liquidity buffers resulting in a weaker earnings growth compared to private banks.  Bernstein said that the liquidity headroom is a lot lower than what the loan-to-deposit ratio might suggest, given the higher investments for public banks are a result of higher deposits and cannot be reduced to be on par with private banks.  Aggressive pricing in loans and deposits by public banks is forcing a growth-margin tradeoff that will result in muted earnings growth. So, even if public sector banks squeeze out the remaining liquidity buffers to match growth, the higher loan growth will not translate into earnings growth, said Bernstein.  The brokerage firm said that with the recent rally, the market cap to pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) ratio for public banks is more than 0.6X that of private banks, despite their deposit growth rates remaining less than 0.6X of private banks.

SBI,2024-03-10T18:45:32+05:30,PTI,SC's responsibility to protect its dignity: Sibal on SBI plea on electoral bonds issue,"Sibal said the SBI knows that elections are in April-May and throughout the period after the election is announced, it would be a subject matter of public debate if the details of the electoral bonds are made public.","Terming the SBI’s reasons for seeking an extension in disclosing electoral bond details “puerile”, Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal Sunday said it is the Supreme Court’s responsibility to protect its dignity and that it “would not be easy” to accept the bank’s plea when a Constitution bench has rendered a judgement.  Sibal, who led the argument for the petitioners in the Supreme Court case against the electoral bond scheme, said the State Bank of India (SBI) claiming that it would take several weeks to make the data public sounds like “somebody wants to protect somebody”.  In a video interview with PTI, Sibal claimed it was clear that the SBI intended to protect the government. Otherwise, the bank would not have filed an application seeking an extension till June 30 in disclosing electoral bond details when elections are set to take place in April-May, he said. The senior advocate’s remarks assume significance as they come ahead of a hearing by a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court on SBI’s application seeking an extension to disclose the details of each electoral bond encashed by political parties before the scheme was scrapped last month.  The bench, headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, will also hear a separate plea which has sought the initiation of contempt action against the bank for “wilfully and deliberately” disobeying the apex court’s direction to submit details of the contributions made to political parties through electoral bonds to the Election Commission by March 6.  Sibal said the SBI knows that elections are in April-May and throughout the period after the election is announced, it would be a subject matter of public debate if the details of the electoral bonds are made public.  “They are seeking time and the reasons are obvious and I am sure that the court will see through them. It is puerile for the organisation (SBI) to say that we will have to collate the material, collect the files and then we will have to find out who gave money to whom..this is the 21st century and our dear PM (Narendra Modi) talks about the digitalisation of everything,” he said.  Asked about the plea that has sought contempt action against the SBI, Sibal said these are matters on which contempt should be left to the courts. “This impacts the dignity of the court. It is the court which is responsible for protecting its dignity. If the court is seen to be accepting this specious explanation given by the SBI, which is ex-facie and something laughable, then it is for the court to decide how it will protect its orders,” the senior advocate said.  “The fact that the SBI has filed an application itself is probably because it is hoping that the court would relent, but my understanding is that once a constitutional bench has rendered a judgement, it is not going to be easy for the court to say ‘we’ll accept what you say’, but that is for the court to decide,” Sibal said.  On whether the Supreme Court’s verdict declaring the electoral bonds unconstitutional corrects the nixing of the level playing field, Sibal said it has still not been corrected.  However, he argued that the court could not have done anything about it at this stage. “The fact of the matter is that the BJP has in that process enjoyed over Rs 6,000 crore of white money, which is huge in the context of what they can do with those Rs 6,000 crore in the course of an election. So obviously, it (electoral bond scheme) has resulted in a non-level playing field,” Sibal said.  The whole scheme was conceived with a political motive for aggrandising the BJP and making them the richest party in the world, the Independent MP said.  He also claimed that the intent of the scheme as set out in 2017 was to ensure that the money comes into the coffers of the government in power at the Centre.  Sibal said that with probe agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate and the CBI behaving the way they have done in the last few years, they will be targeting the opposition parties and leaders once the details of the electoral bonds are out before June. “My worry is in fact that taken to its logical conclusion with the ED being with them and the CBI being part of the so-called establishment, they will be targeting the opposition, and it will create another level of non-level playing field,” he added.  Sibal further said that the opposition parties should have together raised the issue of electoral bonds to corner the government after the Supreme Court verdict.  He, however, acknowledged that the opposition parties were too involved in trying to settle the seat-sharing issue.  “Fundamentally, that (sharing of seats) is more important for the reason that elections are round the corner, but I think this (electoral bonds) will be a big issue in these elections,” the MP said. “I hope the Supreme Court stands by its direction. If they get the names, then it will be a big issue,” he added.  On February 15, a five-judge Constitution bench scrapped the Centre’s electoral bonds scheme of anonymous political funding, calling it “unconstitutional” and ordering disclosure by the Election Commission of the donors, the amount donated by them and the recipients by March 13.  Ordering the closure of the scheme, the top court directed the SBI to submit by March 6 the details of the electoral bonds purchased since April 12, 2019, till date to the Election Commission, which was asked to publish the information on its official website by March 13.

Major challenges include rising pressure on the cost of funds, due to structural funding challenges, and growing concerns on rising consumer leverage, which poses potential asset quality challenges. In unsecured lending, particularly, this could lead to higher credit costs. Further, banks could feel the pressure on operating costs due to elevated wage inflation, and also need to expand the distribution network for future deposit growth, said Goldman Sachs.  Also Read: Private capex is seeing action heat up, here’s a road map for investors  Domestic banks recorded a sharp ROA (return on assets) expansion in FY20-3QFY24. Now, the brokerage believes that ROAs will start moderating due to continued pressure on margins which are expected to extend to FY25, slower loan growth as loan-deposit ratios are stretched and that the sector will have to repair its balance-sheet mix and this, coupled with the need of building capacity, should keep cost-to-income levels elevated.  “We believe all players face the dilemma of maintaining market share or compromising margins amidst the backdrop of stronger balance sheets across the system,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs Equity Research.  However, the brokerage said that an earlier-than-expected cut in policy rates would alleviate liquidity concerns in the system or any measures by the central bank to ease the liquidity through CRR/SLR should aid in deposit growth and would augur well for all private banks in particular which are currently constrained with stretched loans-to-deposit ratios and limited buffers on liquidity coverage ratios and, to a certain extent, for NBFCs which are witnessing an environment of elevated costs of funds due to liquidity tightness.  Goldman Sachs upgraded Bajaj Finance to ‘neutral’ from ‘sell’ (2 percent upside) and reiterated the ‘buy’ call on HDFC Bank (33 percent upside).  Brokerage Call  SBI: Neutral - CMP: Rs 766.95 - Target Price: Rs 741  Goldman Sachs cut State Bank of India’s earnings by 7 percent and 5 percent over FY25E/26E mainly on account of a higher cost of funds and now expects the ROA of the bank to be &amp;lt;1 percent over FY25-26E.  “Since we added the stock to our Buy list on Aug 24 2020, the stock is up 283 percent vs the BSE30 +87 percent. At the current valuation of 1.2x on a 1-yr fwd P/B basis (standalone) and the dynamics around profitability, we believe the stock is trading at a fair valuation. Based on our valuation methodology, we raise our 12-month target price to Rs 741 per share,” the brokerage said while downgrading the stock to ‘Neutral’.  ICICI Bank: Neutral - CMP: Rs 1,061.55 - Target Price: Rs 1,086  “While ICICI Bank has been quite successful in scaling up its ROAs post Covid driven by its shift towards a higher-yielding mix, digital banking which also allowed it to scale up its consumer lending, diversification into SME lending etc, we expect the consumer lending to go through consolidation and hence expect ICICI Bank’s profitability to also moderate,” said Goldman Sachs.

However, the fundamentals have been under pressure due to its subdued margin profile as well as a bottoming of credit cost improvements.  “We believe its ROEs are going to remain sub-par despite improvements due to the above-mentioned challenges and hence the current valuations appear rich. As a result, we downgrade to ‘Sell’ from ‘Neutral’. We cut EPS by 43 percent in FY25 and BVPS by 6.6 percent but maintain our 12-month target price at Rs 16,” said Goldman Sachs.

SBI,2024-02-16T12:05:56+05:30,PTI,SBI in talks with RBI to lower cash reserve ratio requirement on green deposits,"Currently, banks have to maintain a CRR of 4.5% on their total deposits, with no distinction provided for green deposits.","State Bank of India chairman Dinesh Khara on Friday said the nation's largest lender is in talks with the Reserve Bank to reduce the cash reserve ratio requirement on green deposits.  State Bank of India (SBI) last month announced a green deposit scheme, a first in the domestic banking, to attract long-term retail deposits to be used only to fund green transition projects or climate-friendly projects.  The bank said such deposits will be priced 10 basis points lower than normal deposit rates.  Cash reserve ratio (CRR) is the minimum amount of cash that a bank needs to keep reserved with the central bank against its total deposit.  At present, the CRR is pegged at 4.5 per cent, which means that every one rupee that a bank collects in deposits, 4.5 paise should be parked with the Reserve Bank as a solvency measure. Banks don't earn any interest from the amount reserved with RBI.  &quot;We are engaging with the regulator for a reduction in the CRR for green deposits and secondly, if at all as a policy, it can be incorporated into the regulator policy mechanism. Early beginning has happened from the regulator's side also but maybe it will take two to three years to start having an impact on the pricing too,&quot; Khara said at an event organised by the Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode here.  Calling for better and more practical rating as there is a high possibility of green-shoring in the name of green financing, the chairman also said the bank is engaging with rating entities to see if an accounting standard can be set for green financing.  SBI has also started evaluating borrowers on environmental, social and governance rating.  Pradip Chaudhary, one of the predecessors of Khara, had a long fight with the regulator after he sought interest payments from the RBI on deposits under CRR.  SBI launched a green rupee fixed deposit scheme last month with tenors of 1,111, 1,777 and 2,222 days with interest rates around 10 basis points below the prevailing rates on similar tenors of regular fixed deposits at the bank.  The RBI put in place a framework for accepting fixed deposits, which has been applicable since June 2023. As per the framework, financial institutions are supposed to raise green deposits first before they decide to finance green projects.  The proceeds can be invested in liquid instruments with up to one year maturity.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-in-talks-with-rbi-to-lower-cash-reserve-ratio-requirement-on-green-deposits-12288231.html

But there is a twist in the tale,"Several brokerages, including Motilal Oswal, Jefferies and Nomura, have a “buy” call on SBI stock. JP Morgan and Bernstein have an “overweight” call on the counter.","State Bank of India (SBI) has failed to live up to the projections made by the Street with its Q3 net profit being battered down by a hefty wage and pension bill. The state-run lender's overall earnings, however, remained healthy, driven by lower credit costs, despite weak core operating performance, which attracted bullish calls from brokerages. Analysts believe that SBI is well-placed amid tight liquidity.  For the quarter ended December 2023, the bank's net profit fell 35 percent on-year to Rs 9,163 crore under Rs 7,100-crore pension liabilities. The net interest income (NII) of the country's largest bank came in at Rs 39,815 crore, missing estimates of Rs 40,304 crore.  According to analysts at Noumra, despite soft NIM and significant one-off expenses in Q3FY24, SBI demonstrated robust loan growth, although NIM fell short of expectations.  &quot;The bank is positioned well within the current tight liquidity environment,&quot; it said, adding that SBI's operational expenses were managed effectively, excluding the impact of elevated provisions for wage revisions.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live action  While the brokerage has put a 'buy' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 755 per share, it has adjusted its FY24 EPS estimate downward by 13 percent.  SBI's asset quality remained robust in the quarter under review, with net slippage at just 0.4 percent.  JP Morgan noted that despite a 12-bps sequential decrease in core NIMs due to deposit repricing, SBI's credit costs were lower, with core loan losses offset against account level upgrades.  Looking ahead, the brokerage believes that Q4 is expected to see another wage revision hike, while FY25 stands to benefit from a moderation in wage costs, driving up the operating leverage. It has an 'overweight' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 725 per share.  Jefferies also has a 'buy' rating on SBI with a target price of Rs 810 per share. The public sector lender's NIMs were effectively managed, contributing to NII growth, while loan growth improved to 14 percent, primarily driven by corporate loans, the brokerage noted. The unsecured retail segment shows signs of normalisation downward, it said.  &quot;Despite concerns, asset quality is performing better than estimated. With a CET-1 ratio of 10.4 percent, there's a limited buffer, but high return on equity (RoE) and marked-to-margin (MTM) gains may provide support. However, the potential for a near-term capital raise remains an overhang,&quot; Jefferies said in a report.

SBI's business growth remains robust, with signs of a recovery in the corporate segment, the brokerage said as it maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock with an unchanged target price of Rs 800.  Analysts at JM Financial Services believe delivery of growth on guided lines, sustenance of NIMs near current levels and controlled asset quality parameters aiding controlled credit costs should lead to strong profitability going ahead.  &quot;We value the core banking business at 1.2x FY26 P/BV and arrive at our SoTP-based target price of Rs 800 per share,&quot; the brokerage said as it maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock.

SBI,2024-01-25T17:17:21+05:30,Harsh Kumar,SBI warns staff against enrolling customers in insurance schemes without consent,The bank told its employees it had found unauthorised debits in customer accounts.,"State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, has alerted its employees against enrolling customers in government-sponsored insurance schemes.  In an internal letter, the bank said it has received complaints under the whistle-blower policy regarding customers’ accounts being debited for enrolling on to policies such as Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJY), and Atal Pension Yojana (APY) without a proper mandate from the customers.  Moneycontrol has reviewed a copy of the letter.  &quot;These transactions are being carried out by officials sitting at the RBOs (regional business offices). This has been viewed very seriously by the top management of the bank,&quot; the bank said in the letter.  The bank advised senior officials to discourage such unethical practices.  &quot;We advise you to bring the concern of top management to the knowledge of all concerned and advise them to desist from doing such unethical practices,&quot; it said in the letter.  An email sent to SBI seeking comment on the matter was unanswered at the time of publishing this story.  SBI share  SBI's share in APY was 43.35 percent as of September 30, 2023. It was 38.52 percent in PMSBY and 32.07 percent in PMJJBY, according to the bank’s investor presentation for Q2.  Last year, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority chairman Deepak Mohanty said assets under the management of the National Pension System (NPS) and APY had crossed Rs 10 lakh crore. The landmark AUM was reached on August 23 and it took two years and 10 months to double from Rs 5 lakh crore.  Of the total, AUM under APY stood at Rs 30,051 crore on August 25 while the figure for NPS Lite reached Rs 5,157 crore.  Earlier in January, SBI instructed its senior employees across circles not to conduct any business conclaves, seminars, or felicitation functions till March 31, 2024.  &quot;Any deviation in this regard will require prior approval of the undersigned,&quot; Vinay Tonse, managing director of retail business and operations at SBI, said in an internal circular dated December 28 that Moneycontrol reviewed. &quot;It is to be ensured that any recognition/felicitation for the qualifier in campaigns of CVEBU (customer value enhancement business unit) will be subject to achievement of certain core business parameters.&quot;  Alarming rise in complaints  Earlier, in a note to all public sector banks, the Department of Financial Services (DFS) said there was an alarming increase in the number of complaints from customers being forced to buy insurance products, according to media reports.  The DFS said it had received complaints that fraudulent and unethical practices were adopted by banks and life insurance companies to sell policies to bank customers. There have allegedly been instances where life insurance policies were sold to customers aged above 75 years in tier-II and III cities.  Usually, branches of banks push the products of their subsidiary insurers when customers seek a loan or make a term deposit. When resisted by customers, branch officials would admit that they were under pressure from the top.  The DFS said it had already issued a circular stating that a bank should not force customers to get insurance from a particular company.  &quot;Though the situation is changing now, senior management has become very serious about unethical practices.

","State-run insurance behemoth Life Insurance Corporation of India has reclaimed its position as the most valued listed public sector undertaking, surpassing the market capitalization of State Bank of India.  SBI boasts of a market value of Rs 5.63 lakh crore, while LIC has topped it with a market capitalisation (MCap) of Rs 5.64 lakh crore. At 9.30am, the SBI stock declined 1.5 percent to Rs 624, while LIC traded at Rs 896 on the BSE, up 0.2 percent. The benchmark BSE Sensex lost 1.02 percent to 72,386 points.  LIC has gained over 22 percent in 2023 and jumped 7.5 percent so far in 2024, while SBI advanced nearly 5 percent last year and lost over 1 percent so far this year.  The state-run insurer recently said it plans to launch three-four products in the coming months to achieve double-digit growth in new business premium this fiscal year. Chairman Siddhartha Mohanty in a recent CNBC interview expressed confidence in reaching this target, citing an uptick in individual retail business.  LIC also launched a special scheme, Jeevan Utsav, on November 29. The recent surge in the stock is attributed to the buzz around this non-par product, according to Kotak Institutional Equities.  The brokerage believes LIC's marketing force is capable of promoting non-par policies and anticipates the next four months to determine the success of this product. Kotak Institutional Equities retains a 'buy' tag on LIC, citing inexpensive valuations and a price target of Rs 1,040.  Kotak Institutional Equities in its latest note has increased the target price for SBI to Rs 760, maintaining a 'buy' rating. SBI is now Kotak's preferred stock in the PSU sector, attributed to its demonstrated franchise strength over the last credit cycle.  Kotak recommends owning SBI over other PSU banks, stressing on the lender's superior performance in credit cost, liability and asset franchises, as well as digital/technological enhancements. The firm sees no evidence to alter this view, solidifying SBI's position as the preferred choice in the PSU banking space.

SBI,2024-01-15T13:00:18+05:30,Harsh Kumar,"Exclusive: After SBI and Indian Bank, BOB cracks down on misselling of insurance, mutual fund products",The bank has asked its zonal heads to not conduct any further campaigns in view of complaints about mis-selling.  ,"Public sector lender Bank of Baroda (BOB) has asked its zonal heads to not conduct any wealth business campaigns related to selling life, general and health insurance policies or mutual funds till March 31.  Moneycontrol has accessed and reviewed an internal letter issued by the bank to this effect, dated January 12.  The decision is in view of issues being raised on mis-selling. “To ensure doing insurance and wealth business as per proper product suitability and matching with customers requirements while also taking and recording of customer consent at all stages of the sales process, it has been decided to not run any wealth business in a campaign mode,” said the letter to zonal heads.  BoB is the third bank to issue orders cracking down on misselling.  Earlier, on January 2, State Bank of India (SBI) and Chennai-based Indian bank had instructed senior employees across circles not to conduct any business conclaves, seminars, or felicitation functions till March 31.  &quot;Any deviation in this regard will require prior approval of the undersigned,&quot; said an internal circular from SBI, dated December 28, that Moneycontrol has reviewed.  &quot;It is to be ensured that any recognition/felicitation for the qualifier in campaigns of CVEBU (customer value enhancement business unit) will be subject to achievement of certain core business parameters, specified which will be advised in due course,&quot; said the circular, signed by Vinay Tonse, managing director of retail business and operations, SBI.  BOB's internal letter added that all existing campaigns announced earlier, as per the annual calendar of campaigns, including the PRIDE 6.0 campaigns, stand withdrawn for the current quarter.  &quot;It is further advised that all zones and field units should not conduct any business conclaves, seminars or reward and recognition programs/ facilitation program during this quarter and until further instructions,&quot; the letter stated.  &quot;It is also directed by our top management that no campaigns including any local training programs/reward programs etc, with any of our channel partners shall also be conducted till March 31, 2024, &quot; it added.  An email sent to the bank seeking a response remained unanswered at the time of publishing.  Alarming rise in complaints  Earlier, in a communication to all public sector banks, the Department of Financial Services (DFS) had said there was an alarming increase in the number of complaints arising from customers being forced to buy insurance products.  The DFS letter to heads of public sector banks said that it had received complaints that fraudulent and unethical practices are adopted by banks and life insurance companies to sell policies to bank customers. There have allegedly been instances where life insurance policies were sold to customers aged above 75 years in tier-II and III cities.  Usually, branches of banks push the products of their subsidiary insurers. When resisted by customers, branch officials would sheepishly admit that they were under pressure from the top. Insurance products are flogged when customers go to banks to seek a loan or make a term deposit.  In this regard, the DFS letter had said, the department has already issued a circular stating that a bank should not force customers to get insurance from a particular company.  Orders from above  Last year, several bankers told Moneycontrol , on condition of anonymity, that they were facing immense pressure from the top management to sell third-party products such as insurance. Failure to meet targets invited informal penal actions while meeting targets brought perks such as parties in five-star resorts.  Banks typically cross-sell the insurance products of their subsidiaries, and sometimes of other companies, along with loan products. Often, banks insist on the purchase of policies along with loan products.  “We are forced to sell insurance products. Despite the fact that we are bankers, we have become agents of insurance companies,” lamented a manager-level employee of Bank of Baroda, on condition of anonymity. “In the last 1-2 years, core banking work has been disturbed badly as our workforce was involved more in selling insurance products,” said the official.  CH Venkatachalam, General Secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), said insurance companies typically offer gifts to bank managers for selling their products.  “Insurance companies also treat some of the bank managers who canvas more insurance products. They entertain them lavishly with trips abroad and here, and other things,” said Venkatachalam.  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/exclusive-after-sbi-and-indian-bank-bob-cracks-down-on-misselling-of-insurance-mutual-fund-products-12053631.html

The stock hit a high of Rs 91.81 with its market cap hitting over Rs 1.01 lakh crore. At 9.30am, the stock was trading at Rs 90.8 a share, up 1 percent from its previous close. Earlier, State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda had crossed this milestone.  The PNB stock surged due to a sustained rally in various public sector firms. Analysts note that PSU banks are undervalued in comparison to private banks. Banks have bolstered their balance sheets and enhanced asset quality, notably through low slippage ratios and reduced credit costs in public sector banks.  The lender reported 327 percent rise in net profit at Rs 1,756 crore for the July–September quarter of the current financial year. The public-sector lender's gross non-performing assets (GNPA) declined to 6.96 percent from 10.48 percent in this period and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) fell to 1.47 percent from 3.80 percent.  Quarterly credit cost stands at 1.68 percent (-46bps QoQ) and the management aims to cut it down to 1.5-1.75 percent in FY24 by enforcing stricter underwriting on new loans and enhancing collection efficiency. PNB's improving growth and recoveries from older stressed assets contribute to better return metrics, fostering lower credit costs for new lending. These factors are expected to sustain earnings momentum, analysts said.  &quot;We believe the bank is likely to deliver higher growth as balance sheet strength improves further going ahead. Healthy loan growth, stable margins and lower opex growth is expected to lead strong PPoP growth. Overall, asset quality outlook remains stable to positive. Lower slippage formation and healthy recoveries are likely to boost the asset quality further and will help in faster normalisation of credit costs. Healthy PPoP growth and normalisation of credit costs should drive a strong improvement in return ratios in FY25. We expect RoA/RoE to be at 0.9/12 percent in FY25,&quot; Sharekhan said in its recent note.  In a recent interview with CNBC-TV18, Sridhar Sivaram from Enam Holdings notes that despite recent gains, PSU stocks remain undervalued. He highlights significant positive changes in the business models of government-owned companies.  PSUs have outperformed, showing a 50 percent CAGR in the last three years. Some PSU banks, despite stock price quadrupling, still trade at low P/E ratios of 5 to 6. Sivaram suggests these stocks could double and still be reasonably priced.  The BSE PSU index surged 43 percent this year and holds a P/E ratio of 9.12. Improved governance and business models have reduced government pressure for profit focus in these firms. Sivaram finds the entire PSU sector promising, except for a few, and worthy of attention.

Despite objections and arguments in favour of preserving state-owned banks to strengthen welfarism by stakeholders and trade unions, it will happen, they say.  The finance minister had announced the government’s intent to privatise two public-sector banks in the 2021 Union Budget as part of the new public sector enterprise (PSE) policy that restricted the number of players in the public sector to a maximum of four in strategic areas. The banking, Insurance and Financial Services, a strategic sector currently has 12 public lenders and about five insurers.  “I think the big step was the new PSU policy. That policy is now approved and it is in place and I don’t think anyone is going to change it. My experience with policy reform is you take the big decision. It does not matter if implementation is delayed because there is no point in announcing a policy and being forced to reverse it. In that sense, I think privatisation of public sector banks will happen but I cannot judge at this point of time when it will happen. I would say the probability of it happening will go up after elections,” NITI Aayog member Arvind Virmani told Moneycontrol.  Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, of Mastercard and former State Bank of India Chairman agrees.  “Bank privatisation continues to be on the agenda. Many private institutions are very active in financial inclusion. I don’t think that it will be impacted if we have more private banks,” Kumar told Moneycontrol.  The first step for bank privatisation is an amendment to the Banking Acts which is yet to get a go-ahead from the Prime Minister’s Office. The change is required in the Banking Companies Acquisition Act, 1970/1980 which prescribes a minimum 51 percent share of the government.  “Unfortunately, sometimes, politics and ideology trump. But even in this case, eventually, it will happen because that is the reality. Some past experiences or templates can be used to see through the privatisation of PSBs. Air India is a good template,” he said.  Drivers of social schemes Supporters of the welfare argument feel social schemes may be impacted because public sector banks play a big role to facilitate such measures. The government has been asking these banks to increase their share in these schemes. Some examples are, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), Atal Pension Yojana (APY), Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Stand Up India Scheme, Sukanya Samridhhi Scheme, Senior Citizen Saving Scheme and the Kisan Vikas Patra.  Most of these schemes are targeted at rural areas and the fear is that these might be affected. The number of public sector banks (PSBs) has already come down from 27 to 12 due to mergers over the years.  “When it comes to the social responsibility of banks, PSBS are better placed than private sector banks. Large parts of the banking business in rural areas are done by public sector banks. There are many indicators supporting that kind of argument, one would be the Jan Dhan accounts itself, the number of branches of PSBs are more in rural areas. The reach and cost matter a lot. Strong and efficient banks are important, be it public or private, but when it comes to rural areas, PSBs are better placed to do business,” economist N R Bhanumurthy told Moneycontrol.  Another rationale behind the government’s intent to privatise PSBs is to bring in competition in the overall banking sector while ensuring the growth of the sector. But the number of times the central bank has fined private sector banks of late suggests that private sector banks are not necessarily more efficient compared to state-owned banks, Bhanumurthy adds.  Opposition of Bank Unions  The bank unions see PSBs as nation-building institutions that utilise public savings for priority sectors like agriculture and have been going on strike from time to time to oppose it. In 2021, eight lakh bank employees went on strike against privatisation.  “Banks have huge resources in the form of deposits of the people. PSBs are able to deploy these resources on a priority basis in agriculture, employment generation, poverty reduction, infrastructure, rural development and education. If banks are privatised, everything will become commercial. Public sector banks are the golden goose. It is unwise to kill them. People’s money should be utilised for welfare and not for private profiteering. Public Sector Banks are nation-building institutions. The privatisation of banks is unwise in India. YES Bank is private, but it collapsed,” All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) General Secretary C H Venkatachalam told Moneycontrol.  “The government is aware of our stiff opposition and hence they are going slow or maybe they have other priorities now. Anyway, they have not moved further in the matter so far. But I don’t believe that they have abandoned the decision. The agenda is still alive,” he added.  The bank unions are determined to continue the stiff resistance against privatisation, which may have been a factor behind the government's reluctance to move ahead with this Budget announcement.  “Privatisation of public sector banks is certainly not in the right direction. Our nation has got more than six lakh villages and every village having a population of 2,500 should have one brick and mortar model of a public sector bank branch. Any attempt to privatise the existing public sector banks would be resisted by the bank unions,” All India Bank Officers' Association (AIBOA) General Secretary Nagarajan S told Moneycontrol.  Given the heated debate over privatising PSBs, Bhanumurthy says there is a need to take the middle path.  “We have vast experience of merger and acquisitions between public and private banks. I don’t think there is a singular conclusion on the question of whether public banks should be privatised,” he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/debate-over-bank-privatisation-rages-on-but-experts-say-it-is-inevitable-11892391.html
SBI,2023-12-12T14:38:52+05:30,S.N.Thyagarajan,Jet Airways: NCLAT reserves judgement on JKC's challenge to NCLT order on aircraft sale,"In October 2022, NCLT directed the committee to &quot;reinitiate the process and conclude the sale of the aircraft after taking into consideration the applicant as one of the eligible bidders&quot; ","The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on December 12 reserved for judgment, an appeal filed by Jalan Kalrock Consortium (JKC), challenging the order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) asking the airline's monitoring committee to reinitiate and conclude the sale of aircraft belonging to Jet Airways.  JKC is the successful resolution applicant of  Jet Airways tasked with reviving the airline. The all-India Jet Airways Officers and Staff Association have also filed an appeal against NCLT's judgment.  During the hearing, senior advocate Krishnendu Dutta, who appeared for JKC, argued that the NCLT's order was beyond its jurisdiction as the sale of the aircraft was not within its purview. According to Dutta, the NCLT has ordered the 'specific performance' of a contract under the civil procedure code, which it could not have while deciding an issue about the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).  He further argued that the sale was brought to a halt owing to a disagreement in the Monitoring Committee (MC), which includes JKC, lenders and banks among others and added that the prospective buyer could not have moved the NCLT for such an order. He contended that the lenders are obstructing JKC from every angle. Lawer Abhijeet Sinha, also appearing for JKC, told the court that the lenders were deterring JKC from taking over the airline in full swing.  Senior advocate Ritin Rai, who appeared for Ace Aviation, the prospective buyer, argued that aircraft as an asset depreciate fast and the longer the sale is delayed, the less usable it becomes. Furthermore, he told the appellate tribunal that the NCLT had directed the sale proceeds of Rs 400 crore to be deposited in an escrow account and the warring parties may decide among themselves as to how to distribute the same.  Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Venkatraman, who appeared for the lenders argued that JKC is 'neither letting the aircraft fly nor letting the resolution plan to take off.' According to the ASG, the lenders have been incurring costs for the airline over the last few years and they are now losing public money to keep it afloat. Furthermore, Venkatraman told the court that the lenders will also be forced to pay the airport charges running into hundreds of crore.  Casefile  The aircraft sale process was put on hold in November 2022 owing to a deadlock in the monitoring committee comprising representatives of the financial creditors, the successful resolution applicant (Jalan Kalrock Consortium) and the resolution professional.  It emerged that while the airline's lenders were aggregable for the sale of the aircraft, the consortium and the erstwhile workmen were opposed to it.  According to the workmen, the aircraft could not be sold as they have a lien over the aircraft towards non-payment of their gratuity and provident fund dues.  The NCLT directed the committee to &quot;Reinitiate the process and conclude the sale of the aircraft after taking into consideration the applicant as one of the eligible bidders.&quot; In 2022, Malta-based Ace Aviation's letter of intent to buy four Boeing 777 aircraft has already been accepted by the monitoring committee.  Ace Aviation had earlier told Moneycontrol that the delays in the sale of the aircraft may force it to look at other options. Ace had already invested Rs 50 crore towards buying the aircraft and was ready to invest another Rs 350 crore.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/legal/jet-airways-nclat-reserves-judgement-on-jkcs-challenge-to-nclt-order-on-aircraft-sale-11891851.html
SBI,2023-12-12T10:13:05+05:30,Abhishek Mukherjee,Wage Hike: How will it impact PSU banks?,"State-run lenders’ robust credit growth and improving profitability allow them to absorb the wage hike impact without breaking much sweat, analysts said.","The Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) and other bank unions have agreed to a 17 percent hike for staffers for five years starting fiscal 2021-22, but this will have a negligible impact on PSU banks’ profitability or return ratios, analysts said.  The memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed last week between the IBA, United Forum of Banks, and other unions as part of the 12th bipartite settlement.  The annual increase in salary and allowances will be at 17 percent of the annual pay slip expenses for FY22. This would amount to about Rs 12,449 crore for all public sector banks, including State Bank of India (SBI).  Also Read: IBA signs MOU with bank employee unions on wage revision  For context, PSU banks reported a healthy 57 per cent rise in net profit to around Rs 1 lakh crore in FY2023.  On the employees’ expenses side, the total wage bill of SBI alone stood at Rs 57,292 crore in FY23.  While the quantum of hike was higher than that in the previous wage hike cycle (15 percent), most banks have already been providing for the revised wages, assuming a hike of 14-15 percent, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said.  As a result of the agreement, banks will be required to make one-time provisions for arrears of wages for the past 11 months (November 2022 to September 2023) and arrears of retirement benefits (pension and gratuity).  “In our estimate, the impact of wage arrears is unlikely to be material,” Kotak added.  Based on its preliminary estimates, the one-time provision for wage arrears adds to the overall cost (FY24) for banks by 0-2 percent.  Consequently, it will have an impact of 0-3 percent on FY24 earnings per share (EPS) for banks under its coverage.    “While the impact of higher retirement benefits is difficult to quantify, it is unlikely to be material either. Thus, this additional cost will be absorbed by banks without a noticeable dent in profitability,” the domestic brokerage added.  The banks under its coverage include SBI, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India, Federal Bank and Karur Vysya Bank.  Growth Drivers  According to analysts, state-run lenders’ robust credit growth and improving profitability allow them to absorb the wage hike without breaking much sweat.  The key monitorable for the sector is the pressure on the margins front, and not incremental employee costs, which anyways was largely factored in.  “The pressures on margins will continue going into H2 FY24, with cost of funds yet to peak. Most banks are likely to exit FY24 with net interest margins (NIMs) broadly similar to or marginally lower than FY23,” Axis Securities said.  Also Read: Why Madhu Kela, Vikas Khemani and N Jayakumar are bullish on PSU banks  However, credit growth momentum will continue to remain healthy, primarily led by retail and SME segments.  “We believe banks will continue to focus on deposit mobilization, keeping competitive intensity high. Deposit mobilization remains a key lever to support a bank’s superior credit growth,” it added.  The recent announcement of increase in risk weight for unsecured lending categories of personal loans and credit card receivables could potentially slow down growth in these segments in the near term.  However, the RBI’s recent upward revision in GDP growth estimates provides much-needed tailwind for systemic credit growth in the near term, as per analysts at ICICI Securities.  The domestic banking sector is also well placed with regard to asset quality.  “Slippages are expected to moderate and recoveries are to remain healthy, which in turn, will improve asset quality further across the sector. Current valuations are very attractive as compared to the market. Hence, we maintain the overweight stance on the sector,” Axis Securities added.

While it is way off its highs, Yes Bank's share price has gained nearly 18 percent in the past year.   In a bid to transition to clean energy, Tata Power has been an attractive proposition for shareholders looking to benefit from the country’s move away from non-renewable energy. In a recent note, rating agency Crisil revised its outlook on the company from &quot;stable&quot; to &quot;positive&quot;. This comes on the back of a notable uptick in operating profitability and a strong financial performance.   The company lays emphasis on maximising shareholder value. While the quality of business metrics and financial profile may vary from one Tata group company to another, investors have been unanimously confident of the group's quality of governance, and core value system.   The country’s leading EV manufacturer counts the late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala as a major investor. The company has been a darling of investors this year, gaining the most among all major automobile stocks. Its strides in the EV and SUV space make it a good bet among retail investors.   The Mukesh Ambani-led company has several key factors that make the stock an irresistible inclusion in one’s portfolio. While its main business entails oil and gas exploration, it is certainly a big competitor in the other industries too. Telecommunications, fashion, electronics, textiles, and media are spaces where the Mumbai-headquartered company has consolidated its position. Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group. Network18 is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary.   The cigarette and FMCG major has performed well on the bourses, gaining nearly 80 percent since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. At a time when uncertainty looms over the industry largely due to high inflation and continued weak rural sales, ITC's recovery in Cigarette volumes offers decent earnings visibility at reasonable valuations, analysts say.   With the biggest IPO ever, analysts believe the insurance major has levers in place to maintain the industry-leading position and ramp up growth in the highly profitable product segments, mainly protection, and savings annuity.   Despite mounting losses and the overall turmoil around the telecom major, investors don’t want to let go of the stock. Priced at about Rs 14, its affordability makes it a buy.   There’s no surprise when it comes to banking, and to the biggest private lender in the company. It is estimated that there is high growth potential in the lender on account of good capital position, revenue and cost synergies arising out of the HDFC merger, which will aid growth and profitability.   Given its stature as the largest public sector lender, the stock seems to be a safe investment. Analysts say the bank is well-capitalised to handle any additional risk on its portfolio due to uncertainty. SBI's asset quality has also steadily improved over the years.   The IT sector has been one of the worst-hit in recent months as people returned to offices and students to classrooms, putting a stop to COVID-led gains. Rising interest rates are a worry and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been another dampener. This is because recessionary fears and a possible economic crisis have forced companies to lower tech spending. The company boasts of a large retail investor base and remains among a few IT companies on analysts' favoured list.   In a span of six months, the share price has gained 323 percent following the company’s increased push towards sustainable energy and the government's emphasis on renewable sources. Since the start of 2023, the company has won multiple projects. These factors together make it an attractive buy for investors.   The IT major, like other companies in the sector, has been on the receiving end of the post-COVID slowdown and the Russian-Ukraine war. Deal wins coupled with the resilience observed in the first half of FY24 are expected to provide support, and mitigate the potential downside impact on the full-year FY24 figures.   The Tata group is one of India's oldest conglomerates and arguably among the very few to have consistently retained shareholder confidence across businesses. Much of this confidence is attributed to the company's prudent cash flow management, efficient capital allocation strategies, healthy business partnerships and the ability to execute strategic manoeuvres.   The railway company has been on the up ever since regular travel resumed after the pandemic. Extensive connectivity plans by the government have also added to the momentum, leading investors to buy the stock.

He said the impact of higher risk weights will have a 0.02-0.03 per cent impact on its net interest margins in the December quarter, but a better picture will emerge in the next quarter.  &quot;Whatever we were doing, we will continue to do, but there will be a moderation,&quot; Khara told reporters on the sidelines of a FIBAC event here, when asked about the RBI's tightening of norms. After asking lenders to be cautious, the RBI increased risk weights on unsecured lending for banks as well as non-banks earlier this month.  The RBI has asked lenders to allocate more funds against each risky loan that will result in higher buffers in case of any stress. The move also means personal loans and credit card borrowings will become dearer. Khara said interest rates on such loans will also go up as the cost of funds goes up, pointing out that there will be a capital cost that will have to be borne by the bank because of the new norms.  About any possible change in risk perceptions, Khara said there will not be any change from a diligence perspective and that its norms were already &quot;robust&quot;. He said the bank's gross non-performing assets from unsecured loans portfolio stands at 0.70 per cent.  Earlier this month, Khara said the bank is not concerned with its unsecured loan portfolio and attributed the strong performance of the portfolio to its strategy of lending to salary account customers or those working for well-rated corporates.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/sbis-unsecured-lending-to-see-moderation-after-rbis-tightening-chairman-11792671.html

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.  A profitability indicator, the net interest margin (NIM) is a measure of the amount of money that a bank or a financial institution earns in interest on loans compared to the amount it pays in interest on deposits.  RBI action  On November 16, the central bank raised the risk weight on consumer loans of banks and NBFCs by 25 percent on November 16 to curb the proliferation of unsecured consumer loans.  Earlier, banks attracted a risk weight of 125 percent and NBFCs 100 percent. After the tightening of the norms, the same will stand at 150 percent and 125 percent for banks and NBFCs.  Consumer loans include credit cards, some personal and retail loans. A jump in risk weight means lenders have to set aside higher capital against these loans.  Banks Q2  An analysis of some of the major banks’ earnings report for the Jul-September FY24 quarter showed that banks reported a contraction in their NIMs.  Among major banks, the country’s largest private sector bank, HDFC Bank, reported a net profit of Rs 15,976 crore, a 51 percent YoY jump. At the same time, the country’s largest bank, the State Bank of India (SBI) reported a net profit of Rs 14,330 crore in the July-September FY24 quarter.

Growth is expected to exceed the Indian central bank's forecast, with the RBI's economists admitting as much in a recent article where they said there is &quot;wide consensus&quot; on the matter.  &quot;The RBI's projections incorporated a turnaround in the momentum of activity into expansion in Q2 and hence the consensus, if actualised, would imply a stronger pace of activity than projected. This optimism appears to have been corroborated by corporate results for Q2,&quot; RBI economists said in the monthly State of the Economy article on November 16.  Ghosh, too, noted the performance of Indian companies, saying the July-September saw a 31 percent year-on-year growth in profit after tax, with corporate results being strong and broad-based.  &quot;Further, it is pertinent to mention that corporate margin, which was under pressure in the past year has shown signs of distinct improvement since Q4FY23 (January-March 2023). The EBITDA margin, on an aggregate basis of more than 3,000 companies, improved by 444 basis points to 15.19 percent in Q2FY24 as compared to 10.75 percent in Q2FY23 contributed by low input prices,&quot; the SBI economist added.

SBI,2023-11-09T14:50:22+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Banks going into unbankable segments with unsecured credit will blow up: Shankar Sharma,Veteran investor Shankar Sharma said this risk-taking approach makes him uncomfortable as blowups have happened across banks worldwide due to unsecured lending.,"Banks are at risk of blowing up in 2-3 years as they chase unsecured credit from unbankable segments, says veteran investor Shankar Sharma. Sharma commented that the big banks are at a size where they need to take more risks to grow. “The Non-Performing Asset (NPA) number of HDFC Bank came out a while ago and we know what kind of reaction that elicited,” Sharma added.  HDFC Bank in its Q2 results, saw its GNPA/NNPA ratios increase marginally to 1.3 percent/0.4 percent due to its merger with HDFC.  Sharma pointed out that banks don’t want to lend to corporates making retail segments, the prime target. “Nobody wants to lend to the corporates. None of the private sector banks are interested in that. Everyone is chasing the retail loan segment. In that, the bankable retail loan is probably done and dusted. So you need to go to unbankable or moderately bankable which is the unsecured part and this has become a larger pie of incremental bank lending.”  Watch the full interview here  Unsecured loans refer to credit cards, personal and microfinance loans. UBS Group had recently flagged the increasing risks in retail unsecured loans for banks. UBS analysts said that unsecured retail loans increase default risk for banks by 50-200 bps. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently raised concerns about a surge in unsecured credit growth and asked banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFC) to enhance their internal surveillance mechanisms.  Sharma said this risk-taking approach makes him uncomfortable as blowups have happened across banks worldwide due to unsecured lending. “We will be no exception. Mark my words. In 2 or 3 years, these same loans will come back to haunt these banks. I will be then around hopefully to pick these banks when the trade is closer to book value,” Sharma added.  Also read: Positive on power stocks but not on public-sector as a whole, says S Naren  Sharma said despite being a fan of the Bajaj Group as they managed an unsecured loan book for a long period, he still has scepticism about how they handle the risk now. “I’ve considered them to be fantastic business people. They are very capital efficient and focused on the bottom line and generating cash flow. That said, when you reach a certain size, you will go off the risk spectrum. Earlier, Bajaj Finance could grow, because the pool of lendable assets was there. Maybe now they are getting close to the ceiling of that. We'll see. I hope they defy my scepticism.” Sharma said.  However, it seems like banks are unfazed by their growing unsecured loans. The largest public bank in India, State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Dinesh Khara said they are not concerned with their unsecured loans during their September quarterly result announcement.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/banks-going-into-unbankable-segments-with-unsecured-credit-will-blow-up-shankar-sharma-11709321.html
SBI,2023-11-06T13:13:03+05:30,Navisha Joshi,"Diwali bluechip shopping list: RIL, SBI, L&amp;T among JM Financial’s picks for up to 21% gains","Twelve stocks offer good investment opportunities for Diwali 2023, says JM Financial Services. Here's the list"," Reliance Industries: JM Financial Services predicts a 16.76 percent upside for the Reliance Industries stock with a target price of Rs 2,700 due to an expected strong compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14-15 percent in earnings per share (EPS) over the next four-five years. This growth is primarily attributed to the anticipated 10 percent increase in average revenue per user (ARPU) from Jio and the notable momentum in the retail business. Reliance Industries' commitment to maintaining a net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ratio below 1x provides further confidence to investors. The company's expansion in the petrochemicals sector enhances its potential for generating free cash flow, it says. Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group. Network18 is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary.   State Bank of India: The analyst report sees a 17.66 percent upside with a target price of Rs 665 for the State Bank of India stock due to its stable core fundamentals, strong CASA franchise, and digital banking platform, making it an attractive investment. Despite concerns about uneven monsoons and inflation, the bank's positive macroeconomic situation and stable financial backdrop aid the sentiment. Strong traction in retail and SME segments, a focus on overseas loan growth, and the resolution of management change uncertainty indicate growth opportunities and reduced overhang on the stock.   Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro: JM Financial Services has set a target price of Rs 3,430, up 17.21 percent from the CMP for L&amp;amp;T due to its position as India's largest EPC company, benefiting from government-funded infrastructure projects and strong order inflow from the Middle East. The positive earnings outlook is driven by strong order intake, improved execution, and reduced asset intensity, with a projected 27 percent EPS CAGR in the project management business for FY23-25 years. L&amp;amp;T's measures and a 19 percent YoY order inflow growth in FY23 enhance its investment appeal.   Hindustan Aeronautics: Analysts have predicted a 21.55 percent upside in the CMP of Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) to a target price of Rs 2,230. The company is a dominant player in India's defence aerospace sector, which is leveraging its monopoly and the government's Make in India initiative. As the primary supplier of India's military aircraft, HAL has a significant advantage in the defence sector. Its strong technological capabilities, including advanced platforms like Tejas and Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft, contribute to its positive outlook. HAL's strong order book and pipeline of over Rs 2 trillion provide good earnings visibility, leaving it well-positioned to tap growth through its focus on R&amp;amp;D and recent pacts with GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines. HAL is also expanding internationally with its indigenous range of light combat aircraft. JMFS also pointed to risks such as stiff competition, order execution delays and slower fresh order intake.   Sun Pharmaceuticals: JM Financial Services has set a target price of Rs 1,300 for Sun Pharmaceuticals, reflecting a 16.57 percent increase from the current market price (CMP). The leading pharmaceutical company Sun is seeing significant growth in its specialty business owing to the success of important drugs including Levulan, Ilumya, and Cequa. Its strong outlook is supported by the company's strengthening balance sheet and capacity to maintain margins over 27 percent despite higher R&amp;amp;D expenses. Its worldwide specialist business is expected to contribute to total profitability by reaching $1 billion in FY24. JMFS' expectation that Deuruxolitinib will be filed in CY23 also contributes to the positive outlook. As the effects of sitagliptin's patent expiration in the base and NLEM normalise, Sun Pharmaceuticals expects the domestic market to rise by early double digits. Potential risks include shifts in the regulatory environment, possible erosion of prices, or any delays in launching of important new products.   Ashok Leyland: Ashok Leyland is expected to reach a price target of Rs 200, up 19.08 percent from its current market price, as per the JMFS report. The company is poised for substantial expansion in the domestic commercial vehicle (CV) sector based on favorable macroeconomic conditions and increased government expenditure on infrastructure. The company's strategic focus on augmenting its market share in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) segment, particularly in the northern and eastern markets, will be executed through the expansion of its network and addressing product gaps. With the anticipated increase in demand momentum and a robust MHCV demand projection for FY24, Ashok Leyland is projected to grow at the rate of 8-10 percent YoY, driven by government investments in infrastructure and strong replacement demand. The positive feedback received for the company's AVTR range of trucks along with its dedication towards cost-cutting measures, lower commodity prices and more operating leverage further augment its growth potential. Ashok Leyland is well-positioned to benefit from the expanding market as the current CV upcycle, supported by an expanding economy, continues into FY24 while maintaining its long-term goal of reaching a 35 percent market share in the MHCV space.   SJVN: One of the largest hydropower utilities of India, SJVN is expected to reach a target price of Rs 80, 14.86 percent higher than CMP. The company’s total generation is set to grow by 3x in FY26 owing to an installed hydro capacity of 1,912MW and underconstruction projects of 7,519MW (hydro, renewables &amp;amp; thermal power). The company is expanding its renewables portfolio, aiming to add 1.0-1.5GW capacity annually and it also registered a subsidiary, SJVN Green Energy Limited, in March 2022. Analysts are bullish on the stock as it aims to achieve 19GW of solar capacity by 2040, making up 39 percent of its total installed capacity. SJVN has signed a MoU with the Maharashtra government for 5,000MW renewable energy projects and has also secured several other renewable energy projects under TBCB.   Coforge: JM Financial Services has set a target price of Rs 5,920 for the stock, an 18.67 percent upside from the current market price of Rs 4,988.65. The company is strategically positioned to achieve substantial growth, with plans to double its annual revenue run-rate within the next five years. Coforge's focus on risk and compliance, card and payments in the BFS sector has led to significant success, as evidenced by its deal wins against larger industry players. The company has displayed consistent EOB growth and successful smaller deal wins, thus delivering profitable growth. Despite an anticipated seasonal dip in Q3, JMFS expects Coforge to witness rebound growth in Q4. While FY24E cc revenue growth has been moderated to 13.5 percent with FY24-25E EPS adjustments being made, Coforge maintains impressive earnings visibility, with a projected 24 percent EPS CAGR over FY23-26E. The report lists changed regulatory landscape, a sharp demand slowdown, and adverse forex fluctuations as potential risks.   Go Fashion India: JMFS sees a 23.24 percent upside in the Go Fashion (India) stock with a target price of Rs 1,540 due to its remarkable growth and durability making the company a leading player in the competitive bottom-wear market. Go Fashion's market domination comes as its revenue trajectory continuously exceeds that of its competitors. Analsyts believe that the company is well-positioned to increase gross margins owing to its improved product mix and stable raw material environment. In order to expedite store expansion starting in FY25, the company's business development initiatives are in progress, surpassing the present projection of 120 stores per year.   Sapphire Foods India: Analysts have predicted a target price of Rs 1560, up 21.54 percent from the CMP, for the Sapphire Foods India stock, which operates in the two subsegments- KFC and Pizza Hut in Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) space. The QSR industry is expanding in India and is expected to gain from favourable demographic factors and under-penetration of certain categories, which could eventually lead to a significant increase in the frequency of eat-out and order-in habits. Owing to the company's impressive execution, especially with the KFC subsegment, JMFS remains confident about a 5 to 7 percent same-store sales growth from the medium-term perspective while also banking on strong brand equity and edge over the competition.   Stylam Industries: Stylam Industrie is expected to reach a target price of Rs 2,070, up 21.55 percent from its current market price as epr the JMFS report. Due to its creative integration of high-value, value-added products, like high-gloss laminates with anti-fingerprint properties, which accounted for about 6 percent of its revenue in FY23, the company has become a standout in the decorative laminate market. Stylam has demonstrated a robust performance in gaining market share in both domestic and export markets, as seen in its revenue, EBITDA and PAT CAGRs of 23 percent, 26 percent and 37 percent, respectively, over the past five years. This comes against the background of a booming decorative laminate market, which is expected to reach $71 billion by 2030 from $45.55 billion in 2022. Analysts at JM Financials find Stylam Industries to be an attractive stock option due to its compelling mix of innovation, market expansion, and a favorable industry environment.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/photos/business/stocks/diwali-bluechip-shopping-list-ril-sbi-lt-among-jm-financials-picks-for-up-to-21-gains-11667781.html

Analysts believe that the public sector bank has levers to achieve guided growth rates.  At 9:26 am, SBI shares were trading marginally higher at Rs 578.45 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).  For the quarter ended September 2023, SBI saw healthy growth in net interest income (NII) because of resilient net interest margin (NIM). Its NII rose 12 percent, while gross non-performing asset (NPA) fell 3.52 percent YoY. However, the sharp increase in provisions for employee expenses resulted in a big miss on pre-provision operating profit. PPOP measures profit before provisions for loan losses and other non-operating items.  Analysts are positive on the SBI stock, given that its slippages declined after a seasonal bump in Q1, along with healthy recoveries, and write-offs. Its asset quality remained robust as the net NPA ratio improved further and the restructured book remained in control. Investec expects, NIMs to compress by 4-5 bps in the next quarter as liabilities get completely repriced.

Investec has a 'buy' rating on the SBI stock with a target price of Rs 640 per share. At a domestic cash deposit ratio of 64 percent and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 145 percent, the company has levers to achieve guided credit growth rates of 12-14 percent, it said. SBI is also likely to sustain NIMs at current levels.  Following another steady quarter, international brokerage Bernstein has an 'Outperform' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 710 per share.  Analysts at Motilal Oswal broadly maintained their estimates as higher wage provisioning gets offset by controlled credit costs. The domestic brokerage firm estimates the FY25 Return on Asset (RoA) at 1.1 percent and the Return on Equity (RoE) at 18.3 percent. It reiterated its 'buy' call on the stock with an unchanged target price of Rs 700.  Nuvama Institutional Equities also remains bullish on SBI, given that management retained its growth guidance even as it expects some pressure on margins owing to an increase in the cost of deposits. The brokerage firms maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock, and retained the target price at Rs 705. Macroeconomic risk is the most significant risk for SBI, given its size and exposures, it said, adding that margins and credit cost remain key monitorables.

Provisions refer to funds set aside to cover potential losses or expenses likely to be incurred in the future. Treasury gains for a bank typically refer to income generated through treasury or investment activities. Increased investment is expected to result in higher operating expenses.  PPOP seen declining  SBI's pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) is expected to decline 19 percent YoY to Rs 20,244 crore due to higher operating expenses and lower treasury income. PPOP represents profit before accounting for provisions for loan losses and other non-operating items.  According to analysts, despite some pressure, NIMs are expected to remain largely stable, given the structure of the loan book and the negligible need for deposits to fund this growth. SBI's provisions, however, will be higher sequentially.    Recoveries to be positive  Analysts at Kotak Securities expect slippages to represent approximately 1.5 percent of loans in this quarter, with a reduced impact from priority sector lending compared to the previous quarter. However, recoveries and upgrades are likely to be good in the September quarter.  The brokerage said credit costs may rise marginally as the portfolio starts to normalise.

The lender's advances are likely to grow 11-14 percent YoY on a larger base.  The key focus areas in the results include NIM, return on equity, unsecured loans, capital adequacy ratio, asset quality outlook and loan book traction.

To a query on which segment the bank has received the maximum notes from, SBI replied, &quot;The information from which retail or from business has not compiled in the ordinary course of business this information is not centrally available, &quot;the bank replied.  On May 19, the Central Bank announced the withdrawal of Rs 2,000 currency bills from circulation, citing it as part of its clean-note policy, and advised banks to stop issuing the bills with immediate effect. &quot;In pursuance of the 'Clean Note Policy' of the RBI, it has been decided to withdraw the Rs 2,000 denomination banknotes from circulation,&quot; the RBI had said.

The deadline to exchange the withdrawn notes at bank branches ended on October 7, but the facility is still available at RBI offices, which have drawn long queues of people who couldn’t deposit or exchange their notes earlier.  There is a limit of Rs 20,000 per person to exchange these notes.  Sensing a business opportunity, the interlopers have deployed several people to stand in queues to exchange these notes. They accept a large quantity of such notes from prospective customers and pay them the amount out of bags of money ready at hand after deducting Rs 300-400 per note.

While Axis Bank fell more than 2 percent, SBI shares were down 1.5 percent intraday on the NSE after the international brokerage house lowered their ratings on concerns of a rise in credit losses. &quot;Indian banking sector's risk-reward is turning equal,&quot; UBS said.  &quot;We raise our credit cost forecasts for the India banks we cover by 5-10bps in FY25,&quot; UBS said in its report, adding that SBI and Axis Bank's Return on Assets (RoAs) are more sensitive to credit cost changes than large peers. The brokerage estimates FY25 EPS for SBI and Axis Bank at 22 percent and 10 percent below consensus.  SBI downgraded on narrow margins, rising credit costs   From the 'buy' rating, UBS has downgraded SBI to 'sell', and cut the target price to Rs 530 from Rs 740 as it raised credit costs by 10bps and cut the EPS by 5 percent. The downgrade is attributed to anticipated declines in RoA and Return on Equity (RoE) by FY25. The bank's narrowing margins and increasing credit costs are seen driving these potential declines.  Follow out market blog to catch all the live action  Considering relatively low CET1 versus peers, potential regulatory tightening on unsecured loans would limit loan growth or trigger dilution for SBI. The stock at one-time FY25 price to book value does not appear expensive but a likely decline in profitability may result in downside, analysts at UBS noted. The brokerage warns that SBI could face escalating credit costs, and its ability to manage these costs while maintaining profitability will be crucial in the coming years.  Limited upside seen in Axis Bank  The Axis Bank stock has been downgraded to 'neutral' and its price target has been lowered to Rs 1,100 from Rs 1,150. The private lender's margins are peaking and credit costs are near bottom. Its RoA is set to to contract in FY25, said UBS. In the next three quarter, single-digit growth is expected in net interest income (NII). The brokerage sees limited upside potential in the stock.  In the last one year, the Axis Bank stock has risen around 24 percent, outperforming the Nifty Bank index which has risen 14 percent during this period. Public sector lender SBI has underperformed Nifty Bank in the past year, rising around 10 percent.

While valuation seems inexpensive to UBS analysts, they see limited scope of a re-rating, considering expectations of slowing earnings growth, owing to potential NIM compression and an uptick in credit cost. It also sees increasing default risks in retail unsecured loans, which is likely to push up banks' credit losses by 50-200bps. The risk of regulatory tightening is high, it said.

According to the brokerage, India’s economy stands at the sweet spot of growth and remains the land of stability against the backdrop of a volatile global economy.  &quot;We continue to believe in its long-term growth story, supported by the emerging favourable structure as increasing capex enables banks to improve credit growth.

While the medium- to long-term outlook for the overall market remains positive, volatility is expected in the short run, with the market responding in either direction.  &quot;Keeping this in view, the current setup is a ‘Buy on Dips’ market.

With the strong catch-up by midcaps and small-caps, the brokerage said the current margin of safety in certain pockets has reduced compared to large-caps. Keeping this in view, the broader market may see some time correction in the near term and flows may shift to large-caps.  &quot;Nonetheless, the long-term story of the broader Indian market continues to remain attractive,&quot; Axis Securities said in its report.  Axis Securities is ‘overweight’ on automobiles, banking and telecom, and ‘equal weight’ on capital goods, cement, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, IT, metals and mining, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, real estate and speciality chemicals.

The downbeat mood in global markets, rising crude prices, and persistent selling by foreign funds is tempering the excitement to some extent. The long term story is good, maintain investors, but then even the fiercest of bull markets need a breather. Focus is gradually shifting to second quarter earnings. Given the spate of order wins over the last couple quarters, capex related firms should report strong numbers, but how much of it is already priced in remains the question.  Mid and small caps continue to find takers, the stock exchanges’ latest curbs have not dampened sentiment beyond a handful of stocks. You will need to find new naysayers, because the old naysayers have turned believers, one small cap bull told Short Call.  Colgate  The stock hit a 52-week high on Tuesday, September 26, and is now among the best performing FMCG stock in 2023 so far with a 33-percent gain. Street is still divided on whether the company deserves a re-rating. Skeptics of Colgate have pointed out that the strong first quarter numbers came off a low base. The recent rally seems to suggest that some bulls are betting on the company repeating the performance. Last month, Short Call had pointed out Colgate’s dilemma: one half of analysts thinking aggressive spending won’t help grow market share, and the other half thinking it was the only way to increase market share.  SBI Cards  Trading volumes were at a four month high, but the stock slipped to a 4-month low. This is despite the company gaining market share in August, and overall credit card spends rising 2.7 percent. However, there are challenges for the credit industry, as market share of credit card spend vs total spend (including debit cards, UPI) has moderated over time, points out HSBC  Tata Steel  Steel demand remains strong across sectors in India, Tata Steel boss TV Narendran tells CNBCTV18. He expects steel prices to be strong, but at the same time said that “things are fragile internationally.” Uncertainty over a demand recovery in export markets is what has so far tempered bulls’ enthusiasm for steel stocks.  IT  Concerns over a slowdown in the US have turned out to be overblown as far as the sector is concerned but analysts are still reluctant to give an ‘all-clear’ signal for IT stocks. Improving margin and double-digit EPS growth should keep valuations afloat, says Morgan Stanley, and has raised its price targets for the stocks in its coverage list. According to Morgan Stanley, the outlook for 2024-25 growth is strong. That is contrary to predictions by a section of forecasters that the US economy will start showing strains of high interest rates some time in 2024.  Crude  As crude oil prices rose, traders started building bullish bets expecting the rally to continue. That in turn played a part in pushing up crude prices higher, besides other factors. But now the bullish bets have piled up to a point where that itself could put pressure on prices in the short term, according to a report in oilprice.com.  Interest rates  Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari thinks there’s nearly a 50-50 chance that interest rates will need to move significantly higher to bring down inflation, reports CNBC. Stocks have been struggling of late on concerns of interest rates remaining higher for longer. High interest rates will lead to a stronger dollar, making imports more expensive for emerging markets at a time of rising crude prices.    Good bad ideas  Soren Aandahl, founder and CIO of Blue Orca Capital LLC, has a better way of trying to save the earth and environment. His fund is going short on stocks of companies with fake green claims and unrealistic valuations. “The great shorts just happen to be in the ESG space,” he told Bloomberg, adding that capital was plenty but good ideas were few. Using short positions to expose bad bets too will contribute to a better earth and environment, Aandahl feels.

SBI,2023-09-21T10:01:40+05:30,Meghna Mittal,"55% of retail credit has gone to housing, education, vehicles in last 2 years: SBI Ecowrap",The shift from financial savings to physical savings was triggered by a low interest rate regime in the pandemic and recovery in the real estate sector and the increase in property prices.  ,"There is a shift in financial savings from households towards physical assets like housing in the past two years, triggered by recovery in the real estate sector and low interest rate regime during the pandemic. This change in savings behaviour can have significant policy implications, particularly concerning growth and the revitalisation of investments, according to the State Bank of India’s Economic Research Department’s report, SBI Ecowrap.  “On the liability side of households, out of Rs 8.2 billion increase, Rs 7.1 billion was accounted for by increase in household borrowing from commercial banks. Juxtaposing this increase in borrowing from commercial banks with the increase in bank credit, we find that 55 percent of the retail credit to households in the last two years have gone to housing, education and vehicle purchase,” it said.  This clearly indicates that the shift from financial savings to physical savings was also triggered by a low interest rate regime in the pandemic.  “We also believe that the shift to physical assets is also triggered by a recovery in the real estate sector and the increase in property prices. The RBI House Price Index shows a modest acceleration since FY21, which may be acting as a motivator for buying homes. This increased ‘pull’ factor thereby pushing up capital spends in a multitude of sectors. If this is indeed the proximate story of the revival in household investment, this has strong policy implications for growth and investment revival,” the report mentioned.  There is a significant long run relationship between housing loans and household savings in physical assets. Every Re 1 increase in Housing loans has resulted in Rs 2.12 increase in household’s savings in physical assets for the 14 year period ended FY22.  The decline in net financial savings of households has resulted in a concomitant increase in household savings in gross physical assets. The trend is again shifting and the share of physical assets is expected to reach approximately 70 percent level in FY23, due to decline in share of financial assets. We believe that the total household savings – both financial and physical – for FY23 would still surpass the FY22 levels despite the decline in financial savings as household savings in physical assets has jumped Rs 6.5 lakh crore in FY22 over FY21 and as per current trends it is expected to jump further by up to Rs 5 lakh crore in FY23 and hence will outstrip the increase in household indebtedness,” according to the report.  The net financial saving of the household sector – the most important source of funds for the two deficit sectors, namely, the general government sector and the non-financial corporations – moderated to 5.1 percent of GDP in FY23 from 11.5 percent in FY21 and 7.6 percent from pre-pandemic year FY20.  “It has been said that it fell to a 50 year low, however this is completely misleading as household savings must be looked into as a sum total of physical and financial savings. Financial liabilities jumped Rs 8.2 trillion since pandemic, outpacing the increase in gross financial savings at Rs 6.7 lakh crore, thus explaining the fall in household net financial savings by Rs 1.5 trillion / 2.5 percent of GDP. On the asset side of households, there was an increase of Rs 4.1 lakh crore in insurance and provident and pension funds,” it said.  The shift to physical assets has an interesting policy connotation. Household sector investment gradually recovered to reach 11.8 percent in FY22. It is pertinent to note that there has been an increase in capital formation as a percentage of household gross savings to 60 percent in FY22 from a low of 47.8 percent in FY21. Thus, households have now started utilising more of their savings for capital formation. This number is expected to increase further to a decade high of approximately 68 percent in FY23, the report stated.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/55-of-retail-credit-has-gone-to-housing-education-vehicles-in-last-2-years-sbi-ecowrap-11401171.html
SBI,2023-09-17T14:54:13+05:30,PTI,SBI to send chocolates to borrowers who are likely to default on monthly repayments,"The move, aimed at ensuring better collections, comes amidst rising level of retail lending in the system coupled with increasing delinquency levels on the back of the upward movement in the interest rates.","The nation's largest lender State Bank of India is adopting a novel way to ensure timely repayments, especially by its retail borrowers, by greeting those likely to default on monthly installments with a pack of chocolates.  According to the bank, it has been found that a borrower who is planning to default will not answer a reminder call from the bank. So the best way is to meet them at their homes unannounced.  The move, aimed at ensuring better collections, comes amidst rising level of retail lending in the system coupled with increasing delinquency levels on the back of the upward movement in the interest rates.  SBI's retail loan book grew over 16.46 per cent to Rs 12,04,279 crore in the June 2023 quarter from Rs 10,34,111 crore in the year-ago period, making it the largest asset class for the lender whose total book stood at Rs 33,03,731 crore, growing at 13.9 per cent on-year.  In fact for the entire system, the double-digit loan growth of around 16 per cent has been led by retail loans only.  &quot;With two fintechs which use artificial intelligence, we are piloting a novel way of reminding our retail borrowers of their repayment obligations. While one is doing conciliation with borrowers, the other is alerting us on the propensity of a borrower to default. And to such borrowers who are likely to default, the representatives from this fintech will visit them, carrying a pack of chocolates for each of them, and remind them of the forthcoming EMIs,&quot; Ashwini Kumar Tewari, managing director in-charge of risk, compliance and stressed assets at SBI, said here over the weekend.  According to Tewari, this novel method of carrying a pack of chocolates and personally visiting them is adopted because it has been found that a borrower who is planning to default will not answer a reminder call from the bank. So the best way is to meet them at their own homes unannounced and surprise them. And so far, the success rate has been overwhelming, he said.  Tewari refused to name the fintechs saying the move is just at the pilot stage and has been put into place just about 15 days back and &quot;if successful, we will formally announce it&quot;.  &quot;We are also talking to a few other fintechs to improve our collection efficiencies and hopefully by the end of the year, we will have formally tied up with at least half of them,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;we want to continue the pilot for at least four to five months.&quot; SBI's over Rs 12 lakh crore of retail book consists of personal, auto, home and education loans.

SBI,2023-09-07T08:57:19+05:30,Abhishek Mukherjee,"Analyst Call Tracker: Banking, finance firms remain Street favourites as IT pain persists","Banking and finance firms were the stars of the Q1 results season, and the optimism is reflected in Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for August.","Banking, finance, and select infrastructure stocks were the runaway favourites of analysts in August as robust credit growth, stable asset quality, and a virtuous capex cycle burnished their appeal.  Banking and finance counters were the stars of the Q1 results season, and the optimism is reflected in Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for August.  More than half of the companies with the most optimism score or with the maximum upgrades belong to the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) space.  In contrast, the gloom-and-doom narrative continued around the information technology sector, which had to endure a sombre Q1 earnings season marred by an uncertain demand environment due to recessionary headwinds in the West.    &amp;nbsp;  India’s largest lender SBI leads the chart in terms the most ‘buy’ calls in the month at 47.  Not without reason.  SBI posted its highest-ever quarterly earnings at Rs 16,884 crore for Q1 FY24, soaring 178 percent on-year, though net interest income came in below estimates at Rs 38,905 crore.  Analyst Call Tracker: Sluggish demand, unclear debt reduction target push UPL into a pool of downgrades  The management continues to remain optimistic on credit delivery through revamped buildout in SME, steady growth in retail, and existing pipeline in corporate loans.  “However, with pressure on NIMs (net interest margins) in a rising competitive environment and limited headroom on MCLR repricing, SBI needs to ramp up other avenues of productivity (fee income and lower opex)…,” domestic brokerage HDFC Securities said.  In fact, the pressure on net interest margin was the fly in the ointment for the sector as a whole.  While the RBI has been on a rate hike pause, banks are facing increasing pressure of hiking interest rates further to chase depositors. Moreover, since most of their loan book has been already repriced (more than half of it is linked to external benchmark lending rate (EBLR)), analysts expect the resultant squeeze in margins to weigh on banks’ balance sheets at least for this fiscal.  “The delayed pass-through of monetary-policy rate[1]hikes in deposit rates versus lending rates, coupled with faster growth in credit versus deposits, has resulted in a near 50bp contraction in spreads between lending and deposit rates for the banking system. This is likely to lead to compression of net interest margins for the banking system in FY24 versus FY23,” AnandRathi said in a note.  But the good news is that robust credit demand, which underpins the domestic consumption engine, limits the downside for banks.  “We remain optimistic on medium-term credit growth and expect sector credit to grow 13% y-y in FY24F and FY25F, respectively. We continue to view the banking sector favourably on its strong RoE, reasonable valuations and low imminent risks to earnings,” analysts at foreign brokerage firm Nomura said.  Private sector lenders HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and IndusInd Bank all scored over 40 ‘buy’ calls each, reflecting the consensus view on the sector.  Macro Strength  Infrastructure companies were the other top picks of analysts in August, with NTPC, Adani Ports and SEZ and L&amp;amp;T leading the pack.  The government’s focus on infrastructure development, coupled with rising state governments’ and private sector capex, has added sheen to the sector’s near-term outlook.  “Order inflow momentum remains strong and broad-based while some pockets are witnessing moderation on a high base of last year. While government capex continues to remain the major driver, some greenshoots of private capex are visible in traditional as well as new age industries (such as data centres, green energy),” Yes Securities said.  Analyst call tracker: Despite rise in downgrades, market leader UltraTech continues to charm  Most infra firms reported healthy order wins and a strong deal pipeline. Managements also gave out favourable guidance.  For example, engineering and construction major L&amp;amp;T expects revenue to increase 12-15 percent and order inflow to grow 10-12 percent in FY24.  In 1QFY24, consolidated revenue increased 33.6 percent YoY to Rs 47,882 crore, driven by strong growth in infrastructure projects, up 55.5 percent YoY to Rs. 22,396 crore.  “The company’s growing order inflows and order prospects pipeline will support performance in the future. Strong revenue, focus on cash generation, and sound capital allocation are expected to aid the company’s profitability,” analysts at Geojit said.  Pain Points  The Indian IT majors dominate the pessimism list for the month.  The sector as a whole is grappling with the fallout of global macroeconomic challenges, as record high interest rates take a toll on economies in the West and fan recession fears.    &amp;nbsp;  The top five Indian IT companies (by market capitalisation) have seen their sequential revenue growth on a constant currency basis at anywhere between -2.8 percent and 1 percent, a far cry from the high single-digit and double-digit growth seen last year. The biggest shocker, however, was Infosys’ sharp guidance cut for the year from 4-7 percent to 1-3.5 percent.  However, Wipro emerged as the company with the most ‘sell’ calls at 18.  The IT services company reported a net profit of Rs 2,870 crore in the first quarter. Though the bottomline was up around 12 percent on year, it fell 6.6 percent on a sequential basis, largely due to a decline across all major financial metrics. The net profit also lagged the Street's estimate of Rs 2,976 crore.  Revenue grew 6 percent on year to Rs 22,831 crore but that too missed estimate of Rs 23,014 crore. Sequentially, the topline was up 1.6 percent from Rs 23,176 crore seen in the previous quarter.  On top of that, the company rolled out a revenue growth guidance of  -2 percent to 1 percent in constant currency terms for the July-September quarter on the back of a challenging macro environment.  Morgan Stanley highlighted that the deceleration in Wipro's revenue growth was much steeper than its peers. The firm believes that until Wipro manages to narrow that gap, its P/E discount will likely remain higher as compared to its peers.  Wipro’s Q1FY24 performance missed estimates on all fronts, ICICI Securities noted. EBIT missed Bloomberg estimates by 4 percent, orderbook was weak (down 10 percent QoQ), and revenue growth guidance for Q2 FY24 too fell short of expectations.  “Management commentary did not provide any visibility of pickup in demand ahead,” ICICI Securities added.  While the domestic IT firms tried to put on a brave face during their earning concalls by talking about their increasing focus on generative AI, analysts attributed this more to bluster than substance at the moment.  Another notable name in this list is Asian Paints -- another casualty of the rising competitive intensity in the aftermath of Grasim’s entry into the segment.  “The worst of margin pangs seem behind (for Asian Paints). It, however, will jostle with hard revenue growth comps in FY24. This, coupled with rising competitive intensity, could mean that the pricing lever may remain out of play,” analysts at HDFC Securities added.

Also read: State Bank of India Q1 Results: Net profit grows 178% to Rs 16,884 crore, asset quality improves  In a post-results media conference, Chairman Dinesh Khara highlighted that the bank is looking at a credit growth of 15 percent and deposit growth of 13 percent in FY24.  Khara also said that the lender has a Rs 3.5 lakh crore credit pipeline in place for lending to corporates in the current financial year. Here are the details from the session.  On CASA  The fall in the CASA (current account and savings account) ratio is perhaps a trend in the banking industry. All other banks have also witnessed this.  And as far as we are concerned, the drop in CASA is much lower compared to what the competition has seen.  Our effort would be to improve the CASA with the current account component, because when it comes to savings, these days with the kind of product variants available, people normally sweep their balances. As the economy develops, this is the tendency which will be seen.  On recoveries  In the April-June FY24 quarter, the bank recorded recoveries of about Rs 1,200 crore, whereas last year around the same quarter, this was Rs 500 crore more. We had some reasonably higher value of recoveries last year and now that the stock left out is not all that big a number, and that is a reason why recoveries are being affected.  Also read: SBI targeting 15% credit growth this fiscal, says Dinesh Khara  On asset quality  Underwriting is a very important component on the retail side of business and we have worked well on it. Also, we have a very robust control and follow-up mechanism. So that is nothing but the effective machinery on the ground to make the recoveries.  Slippages are not coming from the running accounts. And for that matter, even the stock of our stressed portfolio has also come down significantly.  Corporate, retail and SMEs (small and medium enterprises) do not have anything. Some slippages have come from SME and agri, and there also we could pull back a significant portion.   Also read: Don’t see any stress in SBI’s corporate loan book: Chairman Dinesh Khara  On credit and deposit growth  We are looking at a 14 to 15 percent credit growth. Currently, we recorded a growth of 13.90 percent. Our international book will be very selective and we may not grow as we would be growing in the domestic market for the simple reason that the international markets are very, very choppy, and we can take care of the quality of the risk.  We are looking at growing in retail, SME and also into agri. And when it comes to corporate, we are open to all kinds of opportunities, maybe renewable, maybe services, maybe infrastructure like roads, construction, but it should meet our risk appetite.  On the deposit growth front, we have grown at 12 percent and we'll try to inch it up further, maybe to the extent of 13-14 percent.  On net interest margin (NIM) contraction  Also read: SBI gains on almost three-fold jump in Q1 net profit  The reason is that in the last quarter of the previous year, we had about Rs 850 crore worth of interest coming on income tax refunds. These one-offs are ones which are normally seen in the last quarters.  Looking at the core business model of the bank, there is no challenge and we are at 3.47 percent on a year-on-year basis.  NIM is always dynamic because yield on advances will keep on changing and similarly the cost of deposit will also keep on changing, cost of resources will keep on changing. But yes, of course, we are very mindful that we should try to have a decent NIM, which also means that we should not unnecessarily overprice our borrowers and we should not underpay our depositors.  On YONO and digital growth  We have around 6.5 crore digital banking users. These are not just users of YONO (You Only Need One, the bank’s integrated digital offering) but also across our other digital platforms.  If at all there's a need for digital and technology upgradation, resources are there.  Also, we are investing into analytics and acquiring more customers on the asset side through the digital mechanism. Last year around the first quarter, we had underwritten about Rs 20,000 odd crore through digital. This year, it's about Rs 29,000 crore that we have already underwritten.  On slippages  If we look at that trend, it looks a little on the higher side. Last year in the same quarter, we had slippages of around Rs 9,700 crore and from there, it has come down to about Rs 7,600 crore. So whatever recoveries we are affecting in July, it will actually get reflected in the September quarter. To that extent, the subsequent quarters will have the impact of the recoveries of the previous quarter.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-chairman-qa-heres-what-dinesh-khara-said-on-banks-credit-and-deposit-growth-npa-movement-and-more-11114501.html
SBI,2023-08-07T13:18:34+05:30,Namrata Agarwal,Why investors were lukewarm to SBI’s July AT-1 bond issuance,"The underwhelming performance of SBI’s AT1 bond issue is perhaps indicative of the new normal for subordinated bonds issued by banks and financial institutions. Banks may have to significantly increase the premium offered on these bonds, given the uncertainties associated with the loss absorption hierarchies","On July 13, the State Bank of India (SBI) issued a new series of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds.  The issue was widely viewed as having performed poorly – the bank raised just about a third of what it had set out to do, despite offering a premium of 100 basis points over the interest rates on government securities (G-Secs). This has reportedly spooked several PSU banks that were planning to issue such bonds, compelling them to have second thoughts. The subpar performance of SBI’s July bond issuance is puzzling because the bank had raised around Rs 3,700 crore through a similar issue at a premium of 66 basis points over the interest rate on G-Secs in the previous quarter. That issue was oversubscribed over two times, suggesting strong investor interest in such bonds as recently as March 2023. In the Rs 10,000 crore July issuance, the bank managed to raise only about 30 percent of the amount. The large size of SBI’s July issue and its long tenure are popularly believed to be responsible for its underperformance. We offer an alternative explanation for this outcome. In 2020, a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) appointed administrator in Yes Bank’s restructuring process unilaterally decided to wipe out the holders of the AT1 bonds issued in 2016 and 2017 by the beleaguered bank, without writing down its equity shareholders. The administrator’s decision to prefer Yes Bank’s equity shareholders over its bondholders triggered a chain of reactions from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on the one hand and the courts on the other, which explain a general aversion towards AT1 bonds. To the extent that this aversion raises the cost of keeping Indian banks well-capitalised, this has fiscal implications for the government of India, the single largest shareholder of Indian public sector banks. More importantly, this aversion underscores the urgency with which the Supreme Court must decide the challenge to Yes Bank’s bond write-off, scheduled to come up for hearing on August 21. Appetite for bonds The success of any bond issue depends on a variety of factors — domestic and global macro-economic conditions, the financial health of the issuer, terms of the issue and investor appetite, and many of these are endogenous to one other. While it is hard to pin down a causal explanation for the underperformance of a bond issuance, an overview of the issuances in the current fiscal suggests that there is an appetite for the bonds of both PSU and non-PSU banks.  The above table dilutes the force of some of the reasons, such as large issue size and longer tenure, that were offered in the press to explain the bond issue’s poor performance. Public and private sector banks have made issues that are comparable to the SBI’s issue in size and maturity in the previous quarter, suggesting that there seems to be a prima facie appetite for large issue sizes with long maturity periods.  Also, to be noted is the overall buoyancy in the bond market — over Rs 3.50 lakh crore worth of fresh bonds issued in the first four months of the year. Regulatory Action Impact AT1 bonds are contingent convertible bonds, which, unlike vanilla bonds, can be written down or converted into equity shares of the issuer, on the occurrence of pre-defined contingencies, generally linked to the issuer’s financial health. The decision to write off Yes Bank’s AT1 bonds in 2020 prompted SEBI to take several steps to protect investors from the risks inherent in such bonds. A key step was capping the exposure that mutual funds could take to AT1 bonds and mandating that the bonds be valued by mutual funds at an effective maturity of 100 years. While all the AT1 bonds are ‘perpetual’ bonds de jure, they come with a call option at five years maturity. Banks have exercised this option in all such bonds issued so far, thus making them bonds of five years maturity, de facto. Valuing these bonds at a maturity of 100 years suppresses their valuations, making them unattractive for asset managers. This valuation rule kicked in from April 2023, providing one possible explanation for the undersubscription of SBI’s AT1 bond issuance of July. Another step taken by SEBI was to restrict retail investors’ access to such bonds, by measures such as raising the minimum allotment value and minimum lot size for secondary trading in these bonds to Rs 1 crore. At about the same time, amidst an outcry over these bonds having been missold to investors, SEBI penalised Yes Bank and its private wealth management team for having sold such bonds to individual investors. These regulatory actions triggered by the AT1 bond write-off are likely to have affected both investor interest and the general distribution chain for selling such bonds. Uncertainty Generated By Courts The aversion created by the regulatory restrictions is amplified by the uncertainty created by courts in dealing with the challenge to the write-off. In 2021, some AT1 bondholders challenged the decision of Yes Bank’s administrator to force them to absorb the losses suffered by the bank before equity holders. While the Bombay High Court set aside the administrator’s decision at the beginning of this year, the victory was precariously perched on technicalities and short-lived. In this article, we had critiqued the High Court judgement for not questioning the fairness of the administrator’s decision which upended a cardinal principle of corporate finance of equity shareholders as the first loss absorbers without offering any reasons for doing so. A reasoned determination of this question was critical to the case at hand and for Indian banking generally.  The RBI challenged the Bombay High Court’s decision in the Supreme Court and the matter is now awaiting a substantive hearing on merits. A similar write-off was done in March 2023 by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) in Credit Suisse’s rescue plan, giving this issue a global dimension. The SNB’s decision triggered statements by the ECB and the Bank of England reassuring the public that they would not resort to such write off in restructuring banks in their own jurisdictions. We believe that this would have implications on the way the Indian Supreme Court would look at the decision of Yes Bank’s administrator, if it does decide to look into the merits of the decision. The underwhelming performance of SBI’s AT1 bond issue is perhaps indicative of the new normal for subordinated bonds issued by banks and financial institutions. Banks may have to significantly increase the premium offered on these bonds, given the uncertainties associated with the loss absorption hierarchies. Meanwhile, it is imperative that the Supreme Court decide the legal challenge on the AT1 bond write-off on merits. Investors need to know what they are buying, and regulators need to know whether their discretion in bank restructuring exercises is unbound or bound by the need to explain extraordinary decisions that reverse the fundamental tenets of corporate finance.

SBI,2023-08-07T13:11:10+05:30,Reuters,State Bank of India bets on private capex to grow corporate credit: Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara,The Indian economy has been starved of private investment for years now but a surge in government capital spending and deleveraged corporate balance sheets has led to early signs of companies adding to their capacity.,"State Bank of India (SBI) expects to give out 3.5 trillion rupees ($42.30 billion) in corporate loans over the rest of this financial year as private companies step up investments in key sectors, the chairman of the country's largest lender said.  The Indian economy has been starved of private investment for years now but a surge in government capital spending and deleveraged corporate balance sheets has led to early signs of companies adding to their capacity.  And nearly 80% of this incremental loan demand is coming from the private sector, SBI chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara told Reuters in an interview over the weekend.  &quot;Invariably there is a rub-off effect on small and medium enterprises also.&quot;  About 70% of the 3.5 trillion rupees would be in term loans and help boost SBI's corporate loan book by 12%-13% this fiscal, said Khara.  &quot;New projects are coming into greenfield sectors like renewable energy, batteries and battery storage as well as EVs (electric vehicles) among others,&quot; he said.  &quot;In the core sectors, it is essentially the addition to capacity in sectors like steel, cement, road infrastructure and airports.&quot;  SBI's total domestic advances were 28 trillion rupees as of June 30.  Credit demand in India has been mostly for home, auto and personal loans and SBI has been very &quot;mindful&quot; of the potential stress this segment could cause, given high interest rates.  Over 80% of SBI's retail loans are to its salary-account holders, giving it greater visibility on a borrower's cash flow.  In June, Reuters reported bankers expect the central bank to increase risk weights on unsecured personal loans and credit cards to cool demand.  This, Khara said, would make credit expensive for consumers.  &quot;High-cost consumption credit is not a good idea.&quot;  SBI's stock has gained over 9% in the past 12 months, less than the 15% rise in the broader BSE Bankex index.  Analysts have often said SBI, with a market capitalisation of 5.08 trillion rupees, is undervalued since its share price does not capture the value of its subsidiaries.  &quot;The valuation of the top four or five entities is about 2.5-3 trillion (rupees) ... of both listed and unlisted companies,&quot; Khara estimated.  But SBI does not have any immediate monetisation plans.  &quot;Maybe in a year or two, we might decide about listing SBI General Life Insurance. Monetising the stake in SBI Mutual Fund is not a focus for us currently.&quot;  At 14.56%, SBI is adequately capitalised, Khara said, adding SBI will ensure capital is not a constraint to supporting balance sheet growth.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/state-bank-of-india-bets-on-private-capex-to-grow-corporate-credit-chairman-dinesh-kumar-khara-11114181.html

Street verdict on SBI | Delhivery, Cipla in focus","Indian market bounced back on Friday with the Nifty reclaiming the 19,500 mark on Friday. The rebound was a much needed relief after the recent correction, but can the benchmark index hold above this crucial level this week as RBI’s MPC meets this week to decide on interest rates. Experts say unless the Nifty gives a strong close above 19,800, the rangebound action in the index is likely to continue in near term, with crucial support at 19,300-19,100 area.

SBI,2023-08-07T08:47:17+05:30,Santosh Nair," Short Call | Promoters selling back, rates crawling up, SBI contrarian, RBL Bank, shareholder’s...","The odds are heavily in favour of the NDA returning to power though views vary on the margin of victory. To that extent, the market already appears to be pricing in political stability and continuity of the existing policies","“History has shown over and over, that bull markets can go well beyond rational valuation levels as long as outlook for future earnings is positive.” - Peter Bernstein  After a brief lull, the sale of shares by promoters has resumed with vigour. Over a billion dollars worth of stock have been offloaded since the window for insider sales reopened for companies that have reported their earnings. The Street is divided on this trend. The arguments for and against insider selling remains the same. Veterans say that promoter selling is not as reliable an indicator of the stock being overvalued as much as promoter buying is an indicator of the shares being undervalued.  Besides, the supply of shares has been absorbed without a hiccup, pointing to strong appetite among investors — both institutional and retail. There is merit in this argument. But what about the fact that so many promoters have been selling their shares at the same time.  One theory doing the round is that promoters are aware that their shares are no longer cheap after the recent run-up. Also, they feel the market could    move into a consolidation phase shortly as speculation over the outcome of the general elections could hold many investors back from making big purchases. At this point, the odds are heavily in favour of the NDA returning to power though views vary on the margin of victory. To that extent, the market already appears to be pricing in political stability and continuity of the existing policies.  So, election results may not necessarily be the key trigger to take the market to the next orbit: An NDA victory seems almost a given as far as Dalal Street is concerned. So, the focus will once again shift to earnings and execution. In many cases, the market appears to have priced in earnings two years ahead.  Considering these factors, it may not be a bad idea to take some money off the table, promoters feel, since share prices are unlikely to rise at the same pace in the near future, as they have been over the last year.  And, here is something that the new investors may not be aware of, but old investors would only know too well. While many mid and small cap companies have suddenly become stock market darlings, it is during a bull run that you see the earnings at their best. That is also because promoters realise it is worth showing all the profits on the books as the market will reward them with a higher market capitalisation.  Interest rates  Even as the market bets on the RBI cutting interest rates by the end of 2023, looks like borrowers may have to put up with rising rates for a while. Karur Vysya Bank has hiked the lending rates by 25 basis points across tenures with effect from August 7. Over the last month, three banks — SBI, Bank of India and South Indian Bank — have raised the lending rates by 5-10 basis points across tenures.  Higher for longer  In the US, too, yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is close to its highest level in over a decade as investors bet that the economy will continue to strengthen even as the interest rates stay high. This is bad news for home-owners looking to refinance their mortgages, and also those in the queue to buy a home. At the same time, it is good news for risk-averse savers and to pension funds that have been forced for years to take greater risks to meet return targets.  SBI contrarian  Most analysts have retained their bullish ratings on SBI after the first quarter earnings. An exception to the trend is HSBC, which has downgraded its rating to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’ earlier.  Analysts Abhishek Murraka, Rahil Shah and Priyesh Jain feel the bank will hurt from a double whammy of rising deposit costs and a highly competitive environment in which demand for corporate loans is low, forcing banks to offer highly attractive rates.  “Incrementally, we believe it will be difficult for SBI to prevent net interest margin (NIM) compression. In an environment where NIM and operating costs are both under pressure, fees become an important lever. However, SBI’s fee/assets remain low at 48 bps (annualised) in the quarter. Given credit costs likely to normalise as well, we believe earnings growth will likely remain lacklustre for SBI over FY24-25,” the trio write, adding that SBI’s earnings growth will be slower relative to peers.  RBL Bank  After drawing flak for its investment in RBL Bank, Mahindra and Mahindra has promised investors and analysts that it will maintain a disciplined approach towards capital allocation, primarily focusing on its core areas – auto, farm, financial services, IT services, and selected growth areas within the group. It has now said it won’t buy more shares of RBL Bank in the foreseeable future and it will add to its stake “only if it makes sense strategically”. This contrasts with its stance a couple of weeks back when the auto major hinted that it was open to raising its stake in the bank up to the maximum permitted 10 percent.  Bulls appear to be retreating from RBL Bank for the time being as a safety net to the stock price has vanished with M&amp;amp;M’s latest statement.  Cummins India  Cummins India shares took a beating on Friday after first quarter earnings. The market was betting that the company would gain from advance purchases by customers looking to beat the Central Pollution Control Board IV deadline. But there has been a slight change in the plot.  “The dilution of Central Pollution Control Board IV timelines would make Cummins run parallel operations of old and new nodes of its powergen products. The majority of its powergen demand for this year should come from old nodes, deferring the discovery of demand, pricing and margins for the new nodes,” said a note by Kotak Institutional Equities.  Tailpiece  The otherwise humdrum proceedings at the Indian Hume Pipe AGM was enlivened briefly when one of the shareholders asked the CMD of the company as to why the company was not being more aggressive. As if to drive home his point, the shareholder remarked the CMD should take a leaf from book of Marvel superhero Spiderman who did not shy from taking risks.

In a note, domestic brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher said the bank’s NII was lower due to softer loan growth, while NIM was in-line. Loan accretion, too, was slower at 14.9 percent YoY as against the brokerage firm’s estimate of 16.5 percent.  On the asset quality front, gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio of the bank declined to 2.76 percent as compared with 3.91 percent last year.

Margin decline is attributable to sharp surge in domestic term deposits (+4 percent qoq) which has resulted in surge in cost of funds and improved Loan to Deposit ratio to 71 percent.  “Credit growth in retail segment healthy at ~2.13% qoq of which home loans grew ~1.85% qoq, however corporate loan growth remains subdued at +0.25% qoq which impacted overall credit growth,” InCred Equities added.  It further said asset quality trend remained volatile sequentially with sequential surge in slippages as well as rise in SMA 1 and 2 accounts (Special Mention Accounts). However, the same is attributable to seasonality factor pertaining to agri related book of the bank  “Though we do remain concerned over margin profile in coming quarters, growth volatility due to corporate slowdown is likely to normalize in coming quarters,” it added.

SBI,2023-08-03T16:04:40+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Why did SBI issue Rs 10k-crore worth of infra bonds?,"Infra bonds, which can be issued by banks or public-sector undertakings or institutions, have various benefits including a favourable tenor, Fixed Matters explains in an X thread   ","Banks such as the State Bank of India (SBI), which have access to public deposits, issue infrastructure bonds because of various reasons, including a growing demand for credit that isn’t being met through deposits, Fixed Matters said.  Fixed Matters is an X handle run by WintWealth, a Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) registered online bond platform.  On July 31, SBI raised Rs 10,000 crore through an infrastructure bond at a coupon rate of 7.54 percent for a tenor of 15 years.  Also read: SBI raises Rs 10,000 crore via unsecured long-term infra bonds  In a long thread explaining why banks issue bonds, Fixed Matters wrote, “Over the past few years there has been an increase in the demand for loans but there are not enough deposits available to fund them. Infrastructure bonds and other capital market issuances have become one of the ways to bridge this gap.”    Infra bonds, which can be issued by banks or public-sector undertakings or institutions, also have a favourable tenor that helps banks avoid asset-liability mismatches.  “The infrastructure assets typically have tenor exceeding 10 years. Fixed deposits on the other hand are payable on demand i.e. retail investors can redeem their FDs at any point of time,” the August 2 post said, referring to fixed deposits.  Banks also have more flexibility with such bond issuances, in terms of the liquidity reserves they have to maintain and the allocations needed for priority sectors.  Banks are required to set aside a percentage of funds in the form of liquid cash, gold or other securities with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to protect the financial ecosystem from sudden disruptions. These funds or reserves are known as Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) requirements.  “Maintaining this requirement creates a negative carry for banks and reduces their profitability. However, Infrastructure Bonds are not subject to this CRR or SLR requirement which helps banks to improve their profitability,” the post said.  Banks also must set aside a portion of their assets to lend to socially critical sectors that require financial assistance. This Priority-Sector Lending (PSL) covers sectors such as agriculture, water and sanitation and education.  “Banks are typically always short of these PSL assets and find it tough to meet the target.”  To promote infrastructure finance, the RBI has exempted the banks from providing PSL deployment for the assets generated out of these infrastructure bonds, the post said.

Sharma has been trying to open a savings account on YONO but he has only met with failure.  “I am trying to open a savings account on YONO. But it shows technical errors every time,” said Sharma.  Surya, a freelance photographer and student from Madurai faced similar issues. “Even after putting all the details, the app says that there is some error,” Surya said.  One thing which was observed with Sharma, Surya and a few other complaints Moneycontrol analysed, was a common draft response from the bank.  These complaints on Twitter received the same reply from SBI’s official handle: “Dear Customer, presently we are facing technical challenges as per your account opening process. We would request you to please visit a nearby SBI branch to open a regular savings account.”  Complaints from customers  The issues with YONO are not just with non-SBI customers. Harshit Chaturvedi, an IT professional based out of Mumbai who faced issues when updating his know your customer (KYC) details on YONO.  “The YONO app is not able to update my KYC details. There is the same technical issue it displays every time,” he said.  Also read: SBI upgrades YONO app, Interoperable Cash Withdrawal facility  Moneycontrol had, in April 2023, highlighted similar customer complaints with YONO. The bank had then said that YONO services would not be available for a few hours on April 1 due to its annual closing activities.  But why are these issues with non-customers and customers of YONO important now?  The lender, had in July 2023 launched a revamped version of YONO. It launched a multitude of unified payments interface (UPI) facilities, including scan and pay, pay by contacts, request money, and other facilities. The new version of the app also worked on improving the existing technical issues.  “The YONO app has been revamped, keeping in mind the expectations of our customers for a seamless and pleasant digital experience,” SBI Chairman Dinesh Khara had earlier said.  History of YONO  SBI launched YONO as its digital banking platform in 2017 for its 400 million customers. The idea to create a super mobile app with all banking services and facilities such as e-commerce and shopping came from the bank’s desire to set up a digital marketplace to attract young customers.  “It was increasingly becoming clear to me that we had to do something remarkably different from the run-of-the-mill apps to catapult SBI as a leader in the digital space as well,” former SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said in his book The Custodian of Trust, describing the journey and early days of YONO.  The latest numbers of SBI showed that new savings accounts opened daily on YONO fell from around 26,000 in March 2022 to 23,000 in March 2023.

We thank you for your patience and continued trust in SBI.”  Not only SBI, but there are issues with other banks' digital mobile applications.  For example, the country's largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank, in February 2023 faced issues with its digital and web banking services. ICICI bank was another private sector bank which faced a tech outage in May 2023. Other than this, some customers of HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank, Bank of Baroda and IDFC First Bank, who participated in the retail digital rupee pilot, have complained of technical problems and issues while making payments.

","The country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday raised Rs 10,000 crore at a coupon rate of 7.54 per cent through its third infrastructure bond issuance. The bidding ended on July 31 and the proceeds will be used in enhancing its long-term resources for funding infrastructure and the affordable housing segment, SBI said in a statement.  &quot;The tenor of these bonds is 15 years. This is the first issuance of long-term bonds by any bank for this tenor in the current financial year. The issue attracted an overwhelming response from investors with bids of Rs 21,698 crore and was oversubscribed 4.34 times against the base issue size,” the statement said.  The number of bids received was 115, indicating wide participation, it said, adding that the investors included provident funds, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and corporates. Based on the response, the bank has decided to accept Rs 10,000 crore at a coupon rate of 7.54 per cent payable annually for a tenor of 15 years.  This represents a spread of 13 bps over the corresponding Financial Benchmark of India Limited (FBIL) G-Sec par curve, it said.

The bank has a AAA credit rating with a stable outlook from domestic credit rating agencies for these instruments.  This issuance is significant as, despite the recent hardening of yields, the bank has been successful in raising 15-year long-term bonds at a finer spread, the statement said, adding that this will help the bank in providing long-term loans to the infrastructure sector.

In a note that comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi exuded confidence of winning a third term and India galloping to being the third largest till 2029, SBI economists said India’s real GDP will grow at over 6.5 per cent in FY24.  &quot;The path taken by India since 2014 reveals that India is likely to get the tag of the third largest economy in 2027 (or FY28) based on actual GDP data as on March 2023, a movement of 7 places upwards since 2014, when India was ranked 10th and two years earlier than our previous forecast of 2029,” the economists said in the note.  PM Modi-led NDA government came to power in 2014. The RBI estimates the real GDP to grow at 6.5 per cent, which is one of the highest estimates by any watchers. At present, India is the fifth largest economy in the world. The SBI report said the GDP will grow at 8.1 per cent in the first quarter of FY24, which ensures that the overall expansion surpasses 6.5 per cent.  Stating that the economy is in a &quot;sustained goldilocks” period, the economists at the state-owned lender said becoming the third largest economy will be a &quot;remarkable achievement by any standards” for India. The incremental increase of USD 1.8 trillion estimated in the economy’s size between 2022-27 will be more than the current size of the Australian economy, the economists said.  India’s share in the global GDP will be 4 per cent by 2027, they said, adding that the economy will add 0.75 trillion to its overall size every two years. Such a pace of GDP expansion will make India a USD 20 trillion economy by 2047 when the nation will be celebrating a century of its existence as a free state.  A nominal growth of 11-11.5 per cent or a real growth of 6.5-7 per cent per annum will help India’s compounded annual growth rate come to 8.4 per cent, it said, adding that such a growth is &quot;eminently possible”. Among states, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh will breach the USD 500 billion mark on their respective GSDP by 2027, the report said, adding the Yogi Aditynath-ruled northern state is the &quot;land of the midnight sun”.

Details on SBI’s website showed that the MCLR based rates will now range between 8 percent and 8.75 percent.  MCLR is the basic minimum rate at which a bank can give consumers loans.  Earlier, on March 15, the lender hiked the benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by 70 basis points.  The hike has been announced by SBI a month after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept the repo rate, or the rate at which it lends short-term funds to commercial banks, at 6.50 percent.  Since May, RBI has hiked interest rates by 225 basis points to fight inflation. One bps is one hundredth of a percentage point.  The jump in lending rates is seen as a ripple effect of the rate hikes being implemented by the Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI since mid-last year, in a bid to tame inflation.  RBI while announcing the decision to pause the repo rate in June 2023, Governor Shaktikanta Das also signalled the central bank’s readiness to act in keeping with the incoming data.  While the RBI has largely come to the end of the rate-tightening cycle, the rate-setting panel is expected to remain on the pause mode for rest of the year with a chance of a rate cut if inflation eases on a sustainable basis, economists have said.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/sbi-hikes-lending-rate-by-5-bps-across-tenures-effective-july-15-10962141.html

","In a bid to ensure a more seamless digital banking experience for its consumers, the State Bank of India unveiled its revamped digital banking application ‘Yono for Every Indian’ and Interoperable Cardless Cash Withdrawal (ICCW) facilities on July 2.  The roll out further fortifies the lender’s commitment towards ensuring the access of inclusive and customer-centric digital banking services to every Indian citizen.  ‘Yono for Every Indian’ will provide all SBI customers access to a multitude of UPI facilities, including Scan and Pay, Pay by contacts, Request money, among others, on YONO’s revamped platform.  On this occasion, Dinesh Khara, Chairman of the State Bank of India, said, &quot;SBI is dedicated to offering cutting-edge digital banking solutions that empower every Indian with financial independence and convenience. The YONO app has been revamped, keeping in mind the expectations of our customers for a seamless and pleasant digital experience. This will further fulfill our goal of making the 'YONO for Every Indian' mission a reality.&quot;  This May, the State Bank of India experienced declines in new account openings and loan disbursals on its digital platform, YONO, according to a Moneycontrol analysis earlier this year. Experts had attributed this decrease to technological issues and a lack of effective customer engagement strategies. The bank's customers had reported problems with the YONO mobile app.  However, despite the issues, YONO has emerged as one the most trusted digital banking apps in the country, with more than 6 crore registered users, ever since its launch in 2017. In FY23, 64 percent or 78.60 lakh savings accounts were acquired digitally through YONO.  With the Interoperable Cardless Cash Withdrawal facility rollout, customers of SBI, as well as other banks can seamlessly withdraw cash from the ICCW-enabled ATMs of any bank, using the ‘UPI QR Cash’ functionality.

On May 19, the banking regulator decided to withdraw the highest-denomination note of Rs 2,000 from circulation as a part of currency management. In value term, the share of 2,000 denomination notes (Rs 3.62 lakh crore) was at 10.8 percent as on March 23.  RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said on 8 June that around 1.8 lakh crore of 2,000-rupee notes had come back into the system. Of this, around 85 percent or Rs 1.5 lakh crore have come as deposits and the rest are exchanged for other smaller denominations.  “Even as Rs 1.5 lakh crore of Rs 2,000 notes has been deposited at the banks...This implies that the amount spent / exchanged by people over the counter is Rs 60,000 crore (Rs 1.5 lakh crore net of Rs 90,000 crore decline in currency in circulation Rs 60,000 crore)... This could also result in a bank deposit boost, repayment of loans boost, consumption boost, RBI retail CBDC boost and a possible GDP boost,” the SBI study mentioned.  The ‘precision strike’ by the central bank hits the right notes on multiple counts, taking pressure off substantially from near war-like quest for deposits from banking system while also smoothening the bias for higher interest rates going forward. Additionally, the move effectively anchors the surge in incremental credit-deposit (C/D) ratio, nearing pre-pandemic levels, by filling the coffers and keeping banks ready to meet funding needs from diverse sectors, it added.  The study also pointed out that as overseas markets remain choppy, Indian banks should get more elbow room to meet the demands from corporates to fund their expansion plans through a mix of credit facilities.  Deposit in the banking system through corporates is witnessing smart traction, majorly through bulk deposits, as better returns with liquidity and safety has made bank deposits a favourite alternative for corporates from diverse strata including PSUs and NBFCs.  RBI’s retail CBDC project (E-RUPI) should be an ultimate beneficiary of this tactical move as it transitions from a beta-testing phase in the CUG (Close User Group). The absence of higher denomination note should propel faster adoption of E-RUPI for merchant transactions, concurrent with physical fiat currency.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/withdrawal-of-rs-2000-notes-may-boost-bank-deposits-repayment-of-loans-sbi-study-10817401.html

SBI,2023-06-15T13:56:42+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan,Yawning gap: SBI chairman’s Rs 37 lakh salary reignites public vs private banks debate,The salary disparity among top executives of public sector and private sector banks have been a subject of debate for years.,"The debate over difference in executive's pay packages between public sector banks (PSBs) and private sector banks has emerged again. On June 14, Moneycontrol reported that Dinesh Khara, the Chairman of State Bank of India took home an annual salary of Rs 37 lakh in FY23.  Khara manages Rs 55.17 lakh crore of assets (as of March 2023) for India's largest bank. And while his compensation (comprising of basic pay and dearness allowance) has increased by around 7.5 percent compared to the previous year, it is still not comparable to that of his private bank peers.  As a point of comparison, HDFC Bank CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan drew Rs 6.51 crore in FY22. He manages a balance sheet less than half of SBI.  And while the FY23 numbers aren’t out yet, even compared to last year Khara drew some 18 times less than Jagdishan. On the whole, the salary figures of other private bank executives are also quite high when compared to that of the SBI Chief and other PSB heads.  The report of Khara’s salary almost instantly triggered a debate on social media. While some argued that his compensation is too low considering the size of the bank he heads, others felt the SBI Chairman’s job comes with other perks.  Is PSB Chief salary too low?  This is, in fact, an old debate. In 2020, an innocuous joke by the then SBI boss, Rajnish Kumar, triggered a debate in India’s banking circles — the humble compensation packages of government-run bank officers, compared with the salaries of their private sector counterparts.  In a recent conference call with analysts, Kumar was asked if his bank would undertake a pay cut for employees. Pat came his reply: &quot;Road pe aake rehna padega, pehle hi itni kam milti hai.&quot; (I'll have to live on the road, I already get so less).  Though this was said in jest, no one could miss the undertones to the relatively lower pay of state-run bankers. And as it happens with such comments, Kumar’s remarks triggered a fresh debate on the issue. The comments didn’t go well with many in the banking industry.  Industry agrees?  One former SBI chairman said Kumar’s comment was in bad taste and amounted to lowering the dignity of his office. The person did not want to be named. A few others sympathised with Kumar, saying he indeed has a point about the lower pay levels in PSBs.  Is SBI chief’s pay equitable for the head of India’s biggest bank? That depends on which side of the debate you are on. The SBI Chairman salary must be seen in combination with the perks enjoyed. Here are a few: a plush bungalow in Mumbai, dedicated help, two cars with drivers, unlimited petrol, and so on. But, even then, the total compensation (including perks) will still be far lower than private sector bank peers.  In fact, the pay disparity between PSB chiefs and private bank chiefs isn’t an issue that is limited to the banking sector alone. This is true for companies across all sectors. The problem is that this lack of level playing field could create a lack of incentive for professionals to have longer stints with state-run banks. While the pay disparity is huge, PSUs and particularly banks are supposed to compete with private sector rivals with the same aggression.  As JN Gupta, founder of SES, a proxy advisory firm and former executive director at the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) puts it, PSBs need to be granted a level-playing field to compete with private banks.  “Right now, they are asked to run a race with their arms and legs tied,” Gupta said.  Some of the former bankers who have held top positions in PSBs point out that the low pay is a factor that acts as a turn off for the top executives. The interesting point is the issue is not only about PSU bankers, even central bankers had spoken about lower pay in public sector.  In August 2016, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan called attention to the issue when he said salaries of top level employees of the public sector, including RBI, are way short of global standards. &quot;One of the problems, of course, is that the public sector overpays at the bottom but underpays at the top. I also feel underpaid,&quot; Rajan had said.

Khara’s salary included Rs 27 lakh basic pay and Rs 9.99 lakh dearness allowance. In the previous fiscal year, Khara earned Rs 34.42 lakh in annual salary for the financial year ending 2021-22 (FY22), 13.4 percent higher than what his predecessor Rajnish Kumar drew during FY21.  Khara joined SBI as a probationary officer in 1984 and took over as the bank chairman in October 2020. He previously served as MD of the bank in charge of global banking and SBI subsidiaries, among others.  SBI managing director C S Setty drew a salary of around the same figure as Khara in fiscal year 2023 which included Rs 26.3 lakhs basic pay and Rs 9.7 lakhs dearness allowance while former MD Ashwani Bhatia who served till May 31, 2022 took home a salary of Rs 5.7 lakhs. Bhatia later joined as wholetime member of markets regulator Securities and exchange board of India.  Other top officials, S Janakiraman and A K Tewari got Rs 36 lakhs each while A K Choudhari took home  Rs 28.5 lakhs, according to the annual report.  According to the annual report,  with an objective to continuously improve corporate governance, a reputed external consulting organisation assisted the bank in laying down parameters for performance evaluation of directors, Chairman, Board level committees and central Board as a whole. The organisation also facilitated the performance evluation process, the annual report said.  &quot;The performance evaluation of the Board has validated the Board of Directors’ confidence in the governance values of the Bank, the synergy and collaboration amongst the Board of Directors and the top Management,&quot; the report said.  SBI said with effect from 25th October 2019, sitting fees of Rs70,000 is paid for attending the meetings of the central Board and Rs30,000 for attending the meetings of other Board level Committees. Non-Executive NonOfficial Directors of the Bank are paid sitting fee for attending the meetings the Board/ Committees of the Board.  There has been a long-standing debate on the salary disparity between top bankers in public sector and private sector banks. Typically, top executives at private sector banks get far higher annual compensation compared with that of state-run banks.  To give a perspective, Axis Bank managing director and chief executive officer (MD &amp;amp; CEO) Amitabh Chaudhry was the highest-paid private bank chief in India in the previous financial year, drawing a total of Rs 7.62 crore in annual salary, as per the bank’s FY22 annual report.  Chaudhry was also separately granted a total of 412,938 stock options of Axis Bank during FY22, on the basis of approval received from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Axis Bank annual report said. The stock options were granted at Rs 726.25 per share.  Chaudhry was followed by IndusInd Bank chief Sumant Kathpalia, who made over Rs 7.31 crore in annual salary in FY22. Kathpalia was followed by ICICI Bank MD Sandeep Bakhshi, who earned Rs 7.05 crore in annual salary last fiscal, as per the bank’s annual report.

In contrast, the information technology (IT) pack had to bear the brunt of the Street’s ire as the slowdown in the West and the banking crisis in the US – the bread-and-butter market for India’s software services industry – led to a forgettable quarter  Overall, companies with better earnings visibility scored over their counterparts mired in macro and operational challenges. A bird in hand proved better than two in the bush.  The 'buy' list  The two companies with the perfect optimism score — zero &quot;sell&quot; or &quot;hold&quot; calls — were SBI Life and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone.    SBI Life Insurance Company declared a decent set of numbers in Q4. Net profit rose 15 percent year on year (YoY) to Rs 777 crore, while net premium income climbed 14 percent to Rs 19,897 crore.  The gross written premium (GWP), a key metric to assess an insurance company's fiscal health, jumped 15 percent for FY23 to Rs 67,320 crore.  Analysts were heartened by the all-round improvement in operational metrics.  “The management is confident of delivering 20–25 percent business growth in FY24E on the back of healthy demand and improving penetration owing to regulatory changes. The diversified distribution channels are expected to contribute significantly to the overall growth of the company,” brokerage KRChoksey said in a note.  Also read: Q4 Results Scorecard: The agony and the ecstasy  The company has been maintaining its cost leadership among the private players over the past few years, despite an increase in operating costs led by increased spending on new initiatives, it added.  Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), too, posted strong quarterly numbers, with revenues soaring 40 percent to Rs 5,797 crore, supported by Haifa port consolidation.  “As APSEZ embarks on becoming India's largest integrated transport utility company by 2030, it is strengthening its capabilities in all logistics segments (ports, warehousing, last mile delivery, ICDs, etc). Hence, it will offer end-t- end service to its customers thereby capturing a higher wallet share and also making the cargo sticky in nature,” analysts at ICICI Direct said.  In tandem with other Adani group stocks, APSEZ has rebounded following the rout triggered by American short-seller Hindenburg Research’s report in late January. The report accused the port-to-power conglomerate of stock manipulation and other wrongdoings. The group has denied the charges.  APSEZ is up over 87 percent over its 52-week low of Rs 394.95 hit on February 3.  The other prominent names figuring on top of analysts’ buy lists include SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC and Axis Bank.  Banking and finance firms had a standout quarter, marked by robust disbursements despite rising rates, healthy interest margins and stable asset quality.  Public sector banks’ cumulative profit crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore-mark in the financial year 2023, with market leader SBI accounting for nearly half of the total earnings.  From posting a net loss of Rs 85,390 crore in 2017-18, PSBs have come a long way.  “The banking sector reported a strong 4Q FY23, driven by healthy loan growth, stable margins, and continued asset quality improvements. There were numerous drivers of credit expansion, with the retail and MSME sectors exhibiting robust growth and the corporate book displaying a healthy rebound,” brokerage Motilal Oswal said.  Declining fortunes    JSW Steel topped the pessimism list with 17 &quot;sell&quot;, nine &quot;hold&quot; and just six &quot;buy&quot; calls.  Its Q4 performance was mixed -- consolidated net profit rose 13 percent to Rs 3,664 crore, even as revenue from operations stayed flat at Rs 46,962 crore.  The company also said it recorded higher-ever crude steel production as well as saleable steel sales during the quarter.  The narrative around the metal space has turned negative, given that China's demand has not really come up despite its post-Covid reopening, while recession fears in the West are further weighing on outlook.  “Though global steel consumption is facing headwinds due to inflationary pressures, high interest rate pressures, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a slowdown in China, steel demand is robust in the domestic market,” analysts at Motilal Oswal said.  Also read: Head-to-head: TCS trounces Infosys on all fronts of financials  Some of the most prominent names on this list, however, are IT companies.  India’s IT giants have been clobbered by project cancellations, margin contraction and slowing order inflows amid the gathering clouds of recession in the West.  “We remain underweight on IT as a sector. The macro overhang witnessed post the unfolding of regional bank issues in the US and EU impacted the growth and margin exit rates in March 2023. The companies which reported March 2023 results… expect some spillover of this weakness into the June 2023 quarter as well,” said Shibani Sircar Kurian, Senior EVP &amp;amp; Head-Equity Research, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company.  Initial expectations of margin improvement have been kept under check on account of negative operating leverage, given the sudden ramp-downs the sector had seen.  “Overall, we expect the operating environment over the next two quarters to remain challenging due to the macro issues and cautious stance of companies on discretionary spends,” she added.  Pharma and auto companies, too, attracted a raft of &quot;sell&quot; and &quot;hold&quot; calls due to factors like revenue collapse post-Covid, negative consumer sentiment due to elevated inflation and demand headwinds.

","Fretful over future enquiries by investigating agencies and the regulator, most banks are insisting on customers filling out separate forms for exchanging Rs 2,000 notes. Many banks have made such forms mandatory, Moneycontrol has found.  On May 19, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced the withdrawal of Rs 2,000 notes from circulation and gave citizens time until September 30 to exchange or deposit the notes.  The RBI said customers can make deposits into accounts without restrictions.  &quot;The Rs 2,000 banknotes can be deposited into bank accounts and cash requirements can be drawn thereafter, against these deposits,&quot; RBI said in an official statement.  Members of the public can exchange Rs2,000 banknotes up to a limit of Rs 20,000 at a time, the central bank had said.  Playing safe  Banks are insisting on customers filling separate forms as a precautionary measure so that data on every such transaction is accounted for with customer details to share with RBI or other agencies if enquiries arise in future, bankers said.  &quot;We have introduced forms because we want to keep data on who has exchanged money from our bank,” a senior banker in Mumbai/Delhi with a state-run bank told Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity.  “This is to ensure we don't fall in trouble (in case of future enquiries),&quot; the banker added.  Another banker said many people tried to come to branches to exchange Rs 2,000 notes multiple times.  &quot;Only motive to come up with this separate form at the time of exchange is to keep track of how many people are coming to the branch to exchange the Rs 2,000 notes,” said the second banker.  To ascertain the progress of Rs2000 note deposits/ exchange, Moneycontrol reporters visited several bank branches in New Delhi and Mumbai.  Banks insisting on forms being filled include Punjab National Bank (PNB), Bank of Baroda (BOB), Canara Bank, Axis Bank, IDFC First Bank, RBL Bank and HDFC Bank.  &quot;As directed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), we are facilitating Rs 2,000 denomination notes deposited in customer accounts without the requirement of any document submission. This has been ensured at all our branches across the country. Besides, the exchange of Rs 2,000 denomination bank notes is being facilitated, up to the limit of Rs 20,000 at a time, for our customers based on customer ID and for all non-HDFC Bank customers a copy of any of the officially valid document (OVD) or pan card is required. This is as per the RBI’s master direction on Know Your Customer and in line with the extant process of the bank. HDFC Bank stands committed to serving its customers,&quot; an official from HDFC Bank said.  Except for HDFC Bank, emails sent to other banks seeking responses for this story remained unanswered till the time of filing this copy.  A few banks such as ICICI Bank are using the deposit slip instead of separate forms for the exchange of Rs 2,000 notes.  &quot;We are only allowing customers to exchange Rs 2,000 notes once in a day; also we are not facing any kind of liquidity crises so far and have enough cash for exchange,&quot; a Delhi-based banker said.  State Bank of India (SBI) on May 22 informed all its branches that no form or identity proof would be needed to exchange Rs 2,000 currency notes and reiterated the one-time limit of Rs 20,000 for depositing or exchanging banknotes.  &quot;The facility of exchanging Rs 2,000 notes to all members of the public up to a limit of Rs 20,000 at a time will be allowed without obtaining any requisition slip,&quot; the country's largest lender said in a press release on May 20. &quot;No identity proof is required to be submitted by the tenderer at the time of exchange.&quot;  Officials at SBI said there are no restrictions on customers coming in multiple times to exchange notes.  &quot;This is true that many people are coming to exchange multiple times to exchange Rs 2,000 notes and exchanging more than 10 notes. However, we try to keep an eye on this too, &quot;said a senior SBI official.  Rs 2,000 note so far in the market  The latest release on May 19 by the RBI showed the total value of Rs 2,000 banknotes was Rs 3.62 lakh crore constituting only 10.8 percent of notes in circulation on March 31, 2023.  About 89 percent of the Rs 2,000 denomination banknotes were issued prior to March 2017 and are at the end of their estimated lifespan of 4-5 years.  “It has also been observed that this (Rs 2,000 banknote) denomination is not commonly used for transactions. Further, the stock of banknotes in other denominations continues to be adequate to meet the currency requirement of the public,” the RBI said in the release.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/rs-2000-notes-most-banks-insist-on-customers-filling-separate-forms-for-note-exchange-10690541.html

The High Court bench led by Chief Justice Satish Chandra noted that they will pass appropriate orders.  Appearing in person, lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay filed the plea that the notifications by RBI and SBI in this regard are arbitrary, irrational and offend Articles 14 of the Constitution of India. He took the court through his plea.  Appearing for RBI, senior advocate Parag Tripathi urged the bench to dismiss the plea on the ground that the constitution bench of SC has time and again reiterated that they cannot interfere in the nation’s economic policies.  Tripathi further argued that withdrawing Rs. 2000 notes is not demonetisation but a statutory exercise, hence it is not a public issue.  The bench, on hearing both the parties reserved the case for judgment.  The petition said that a large amount of the currency has reached either an individual's locker or has &quot;been hoarded by the separatists, terrorists, Maoists, drug smugglers, mining mafias &amp;amp; corrupt people&quot;.  The petition highlighted that cash transaction in high-value currency is the main source of corruption and is used for illegal activities like terrorism, naxalism, separatism, radicalism, gambling, smuggling, money laundering, kidnapping, extortion, bribing and dowry, etc. and the RBI and SBI should ensure that Rs 2,000 banknotes are deposited in respective bank accounts only.  &quot;Recently, it was announced by the Centre that every family should have Aadhaar card and bank account. Therefore, why is RBI permitting to exchange Rs 2,000 banknotes without obtaining identity proof? It is also necessary to state that 80 crore BPL families receive free grains. It means 80 crore Indians rarely use Rs 2,000 banknotes. Therefore, petitioner also seeks direction to RBI and SBI to take steps to ensure that Rs 2,000 banknotes are deposited in a bank account only,&quot; the plea stated.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/legal/delhi-hc-reserves-order-in-pil-against-exchange-of-rs-2000-banknote-without-requisition-slip-identity-proof-10643561.html

SBI,2023-05-02T08:36:19+05:30,Santosh Nair,"Short Call | SBI Card, Car Trade, Cement, Steel, and Poor Charlie’s admission","Decent set of quarterly earnings, record tax collections, low probability of RBI hiking rates and heavy FII purchases have tilted the game in favour of the bulls for now","“No one can predict with any certainty which way the next 1,000 points will be. Market fluctuations, while no means comfortable, are normal.” - Peter Lynch  The quote is relevant in the context of the wild swings the Nifty threw up over the last couple of months. The mood appears to have changed rapidly from pessimism to caution and then to cautious optimism and now bullishness. It has still not reached a stage of exuberance, which means that upswing may still have some steam left.  Decent set of quarterly earnings, record tax collections, low probability of RBI hiking rates and heavy FII purchases have tilted the game in favour of the bulls for now. Another couple of hundred of points of rally on the Nifty and that could again raise the question whether earnings growth is good enough to justify valuations.  SBI Card  The latest quarterly earnings are decent, just that they are not good enough to trigger the rerating that investors have been patiently waiting for. Higher cost of funds, increase in operating expenses and a lower revolver book (card users paying just the minimum amount due and carrying forward the rest) took some sheen off the numbers. A healthy revolver book is key to a credit card company’s earnings because that is where it earns the juicy margins. But with interest rates already high, fewer customers are carrying forward their outstanding.    “We expect the revolver mix to improve gradually; however, margin could remain under pressure as the borrowing cost is expected to increase further,” wrote Motilal Oswal analysts Nitin Aggarwal and Yash Agarwal in their note.  Car Trade  Even before the Paytm IPO bombed, Cartrade Tech’s public offer in September 2021 was the harbinger of trouble brewing for public offerings by new age businesses. The stock is trading at a fourth of its IPO price as the operating performance is trying to catch up valuations that still appear excessive. The fourth-quarter earnings show that things are improving slowly, but looks like the road to glory is still a long one.  In April last year, Kotak Institutional Equities and Nomura had turned bullish on the stock, but their positive reviews cut no ice with fund managers or wealthy individuals. And now Nomura has trimmed its price target for the stock by a good 20 percent to factor in a more realistic picture even as it has retained its buy rating.  “We lower target EV/sales to 6x (from 7x) for the classified business, in line with the correction at its domestic peers, and that for SAMIL (online vehicle transaction platform) to 4x (5x earlier), at the lower end of its likely range of 4-6x, as recovery seems to be taking longer than we had expected. We now don’t assign any premium to Absure business over classifieds, given the slower ramp-up.”  Cement  What was a price hike story till a quarter back has now turned into a volume game story as companies try to sell as much as they can. According to industry veteran Anil Singhvi, prices could be hiked next month or could even be delayed till October. Profit margins are still hurting from high fuel costs, and cement majors are hoping that prices stay at current levels. And the consolidation story—big players buying smaller companies—may not be playing out immediately. According to Singhvi, the big cement companies are looking to squeeze out existing capacity before they start acquiring fresh capacity.  Steel  It is a mixed picture for steel at this point.  The good news is that coking coal prices are falling, providing relief to profit margins of steel companies. But the China demand story is not playing out as expected.  From the ICICI Securities report:  “Despite heathy credit indicators, we find Chinese steel demand remains elusive, resulting in sharp correction in international iron ore prices. Domestic hot rolled coil prices have slid by Rs 100/tonne week-on-week on an average as demand remains weak, particularly for longs. As per our channel checks, traders are waiting for price announcement by the major mills for May’23.”  Reverse swing  Crompton Greaves and IPCA took a pounding last week, falling 12 and 17 percent. The bruising fall appears to have drawn more bears to both stocks, who feel there is some more money to be made by going short. This has led to open interest in the futures of these stocks rising to more than double of the average of the last three months, at the beginning of the new series. From a fundamental perspective, both companies have little going in their favour at this point. But technicals could be another matter altogether. Derivatives traders say the huge bearish positions at the start of the series could indicate that the stocks could be close to making a near term bottom.  US inflation  Supply chain constraints may have eased, and the labour market too is showing signs of cooling. This has raised hopes that the Fed may start cutting rates earlier than expected. But author of the Greed and Fear newsletter Christopher Wood has warned that inflation could surprise, but not pleasantly.  From his piece:  “Last year’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with its uncapped subsidies, marks the biggest move GREED &amp;amp; fear has seen yet against the agenda of free market capitalism which the US is meant to believe in. The result will be an onshoring investment boom, which will be both inflationary and lead to a massive misallocation of capital. GREED &amp;amp; fear was interested to read a quote attributed to BlackRock chairman Larry Fink in a recommended pinko paper article this week that the Biden administration’s efforts to reshore manufacturing meant that US inflation was unlikely to fall below 4% “anytime soon”  EV’s Guinea Pig  The ‘green’ of electric mobility has some dark hues as well. The accelerated adoption of electric vehicles is having a knock-on effect on bauxite - the main source of aluminium, which in turn is a vital input for EVs due to its light weight and better thermal connectivity than steel. At the centre of the aluminium value chain lies Guinea – an impoverished West African nation that is blessed with the world’s biggest reserves of bauxite.  But this blessing has turned into a curse for thousands of locals. An investigation by The Washington Post, reveals that hundreds of square miles once used for farming have been acquired by mining companies, with villagers receiving little or no compensation. In the next two decades, according to a government study, more than 200,000 acres of farmland and 1.1 million acres of natural habitat will be destroyed by bauxite mining.  Rich Charlie's Almanack  For investors struggling to keep their morale (and portfolio) up in this listless market, here are some reassuring words from Charlie Munger himself. The 99-year-old investing legend, in an interview with FT, voiced a nagging suspicion most of us have had – things were actually better in the good ol’ days.  Reminiscing the times in late 1950s when he met Warren Buffett, Munger remarked: “We were a creature of a particular time and a perfect set of opportunities…a perfect period to be a common stock investor. We benefited by and large [from] low interest rates, low equity values, ample opportunities.” “It’s gotten very tough to have anything like the returns that were obtained in the past.  [At] the exact time that the game is getting tougher we’ve got more and more people trying to play it.”  Shubham Raj and Abhishek Mukherjee contributed to this piece",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/short-call-sbi-card-car-trade-cement-steel-and-poor-charlies-admission-10508921.html

SBI,2023-04-24T16:19:39+05:30,Siddharth Upasani,SBI economist rejects Viral Acharya's claim that big firms are behind high core inflation,"In March, Acharya - formerly a deputy governor of the RBI - had said in a paper that India's core inflation was persistent and elevated due to the pricing power of its large firms and recommended they be broken up","A top Indian economist has rejected former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor Viral Acharya's assertion that the pricing power of India's large conglomerates is behind the high and persistent core inflation.  Writing in a report, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, State Bank of India's group chief economic adviser, said it would be &quot;factually incorrect&quot; to say that concentration of power in a few firms and the resultant pricing capacity explain elevated domestic core inflation.  &quot;...the increase in prices during the pandemic was more on account of supply chain and logistical disruptions caused by the pandemic and after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine rather than firms increasing prices because of higher pricing power,&quot; Ghosh said in a report on April 24.  &quot;It is thus incorrect to infer that concentration power dictated pricing capacity of firms and thus resulting in unyielding core inflation,&quot; he added.  In March, Acharya - now the CV Starr Professor of Economics at New York University's Stern School of Business - had authored a paper that said Indian consumers were not fully benefiting from the fall in input prices due to greater pricing power in increasingly concentrated industrial organisation structures.  &quot;What lends some credibility to this thesis is the observation that in contrast to the rest of the world, India's core inflation is rising more in Goods, where its industrial sectors are increasingly concentrated, than in Services, though there are early signs of pricing power rising in the Services sector too,&quot; Acharya wrote. He went on to recommend that India should look to break up its large industrial firms &quot;by regulatory fiat or via competition commission diktat&quot;.  Core inflation has been sticky around 6 percent for the better part of two years now, although it eased to 5.8 percent in March. In his paper, Acharya - who was a member of the RBI's Monetary Policy Committee from January 2017 to July 2019 - said the central bank's task of bringing down inflation has been &quot;rendered difficult by the persistence of elevated core inflation&quot;.  However, an analysis of seven sectors - telecom, FMCG, two-wheelers, passenger vehicles, retail trade, and steel and basic metals - by SBI's Soumya Kanti Ghosh found that core inflation has been elevated over the last 2-3 years due to supply-side shocks rather than corporate pricing power.  On constructing a measure of inflation he termed 'CPI Industrial Concentration Index', Ghosh said the price rise as per this measure was less than core CPI inflation starting January 2015.   Source: SBI Research  &quot;For a brief period beginning January 2020 till November 2020 and also further during the pandemic as supply disruptions weighed heavily, the estimated concentration CPI was higher than the core CPI,&quot; Ghosh added.  Ghosh's analysis also found that it is food inflation, not core inflation, which has been driving headline retail inflation.  &quot;On average, 45,600 new firms were registered every year in India, in the period between 1980 and 2018. It vaulted towards 2 lakh (around 1.85 lakh per early estimates) in 2023. In principle, the number of firms formed during 2018-2022 has been much higher in comparison, with a spirit of entrepreneurship sweeping across the nation,&quot; Ghosh added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/sbi-economist-rejects-viral-acharyas-claim-that-big-firms-are-behind-high-core-inflation-10466491.html

However, according to local authorities and family members of the lady, she wasn't going to the bank but was returning from her daughter's house.  &quot;The video was misinterpreted and the issue blown out of proportion,&quot; Kamal Lochan Mishra, Collector and District Magistrate of Nabarangpur, told Moneycontrol.  &quot;The truth is the lady was coming from her daughter's house. Our block social security officer and programme assistant have taken the lady in the government vehicle to the SBI branch and dropped her back home,&quot; the Collector said.  Moneycontrol reached out to Suryo Harijan's granddaughter Tanuja Harijan, who confirmed the same. &quot;My grandmother was coming from our relative's house, not going to the bank,&quot; Tanuja Harijan said.

SBI,2023-04-21T21:40:37+05:30,Jinit Parmar,"Top bankers never retire! Fintechs rope in veteran bankers to build brand, trust","Some experts also suggested that when fintech companies hire a veteran banker, a certain goodwill also comes along.","Indian fintech companies are aggressively hiring former top bankers and central bankers. In the last 24 months, at least 10 former bankers have joined the boards of fintech companies. Experts attribute this to a bigger corporate strategy to gain the trust of investors and customers, besides seeking smooth relations with regulators on compliance issues.  Such moves assume significance as fintech companies are facing tighter regulatory scrutiny on a range of issues related to corporate governance, lending norms, and the array of activities these companies can participate in.  For example, recently Bengaluru-based-Razorpay appointed N S Vishwanathan, former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as an advisor to the board. Also, the fintech company hired the former managing director (MD) of State Bank of India (SBI) and the former chairman of HDB Financial Services, Arijit Basu, as an advisor. Razorpay is one of the largest fintech companies in the country with operations in the payments segment. According to the company’s annual financial report, its operating revenue jumped 76.1 percent to Rs 1,481 crore in financial year 2021-22 (FY22) from Rs 841 crore in FY21.    Similarly, Bengaluru-based slice roped in former executive director (ED) of RBI, Eugene Emmanuel Karthak, as an independent director. The company also hired S Vishvanathan, ex-MD, SBI, for an advisory role, in March 2023.  Perhaps, one of the biggest such moves in the fintech space took place when BharatPe hired former SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar, and former RBI deputy governor B P Kanungo as non-executive chairman and independent director, respectively, in September 2022. Kumar is also an advisor to Gurugram-based digital lender Indifi Technologies.  There are other examples too. Delhi-based fintech company Stashfin appointed former MD and CEO of SBI Card, Vijay Jasuja, as a non-independent ED in September 2022, while EbixCash roped in Uma Shankar, former ED, RBI, as an independent director.  That apart, Qwikcilver, a digital gift card fintech company based in Bengaluru, appointed former RBI ED G Padmanabhan as an advisor in August 2016.  Also read: Budget 2023: Fintechs demand more allocations, tax reforms and bank partnerships  In March 2020, US-based cloud-service provider Salesforce hired former SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya as its India CEO.  Why are retired bankers in demand?  So, why are fintech company running to hire former bankers? According to experts, such hiring is part of a bigger corporate strategy to gain the trust of investors and customers, besides seeking smooth relations with regulators on compliance issues.    “Fintech companies have issues with regulatory requirements and business operations compliances. Industry experts can help mitigate these issues,” said Chandan Sinha, former ED, RBI.  Fintechs are a booming market. According to data from the government's Invest India portal, the Indian fintech industry's market size is expected to grow to $150 billion by 2025 from $50 billion in 2021. The sector is also expected to have $1 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and nearly $200 billion in revenue by 2023, data from Invest India said.  Also, the government has plans for growing and expanding the reach and innovation in the fintech sector.  Also read: India has highest fintech adoption in the world, says Rajeev Chandrasekhar at India Fintech Conclave  The appointment of former bankers on the boards of company as advisors can help fintech companies get clarity on the business and operations aspects of the sector, experts said.  “Fintech companies are young and they have creative ideas. They need guidance on several issues,” said Rajnish Kumar of SBI.  Sinha said the experience of veteran bankers can help fintech companies formulate policies in the short to medium term.  Dealing with regulatory challenges  Over the last few years, the regulator has upped scrutiny on fintech companies.  RBI, in August 2022, introduced new guidelines for fintech companies operating in the digital lending space. Under the guidelines, fintech companies are required to disclose all costs upfront in a digital loan product to the customer, even as they are not allowed to scrub or read borrowers’ smartphones. In August 2022, ratings agency CRISIL highlighted that the new rules will raise the operational intensity and compliance costs for lenders in the near term.  Also read: Budget 2023: Fintechs, NBFCs look out for a liquidity booster from FM for financial inclusion  Ajay Kumar Choudhary, ED, RBI, highlighted that the regulator has to keep a watchful eye on fintechs and the associated risks.  &quot;Regulators need to keep a watchful eye on the risks by fintech companies and big techs. The risks posed by fintech start-ups and big techs are different,&quot; said Choudhary at the Moneycontrol Fintech Conclave.  For fintech companies, experts highlighted, the appointment of veteran bankers can help formulate operational tactics around regulatory issues. Ram Rastogi, Chairman of Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE) said that fintechs earlier did not look at governance and corporate aspects of the business.  “After the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) crisis, some of the major fintech players had to take a second look at their governance and compliance work. This is where they are looking at making policies clear and hiring banking sector experts,” Rastogi said.  Sinha said that sector experts can guide fintech companies on macro policies. “Fintech companies need to know what is permissible under their sector. They need a regulatory perspective on how to look at business,” Sihna said.  Former bankers in advisory roles  When former bankers join the boards of companies, they do not have a day-to-day role to play in the business of the fintech company. Instead, these former central bankers and chiefs of banks act as guides to these fintech companies.  According to experts, these bankers attend weekly or monthly meetings where major issues around the company’s operations are discussed.  Also read: Increased scrutiny of bank-fintech alliance puts start-up ecosystem at risk  “As an advisor or member of the board, they are not required to come or participate in the daily running of the company. They have to work as advisors or consultants discussing macro and major issues related to the company, such as scaling operations, regulatory aspects, etc.,” said Rastogi.  Sinha said the 30-40 years of sector experience of the bankers help them work around the bigger issues concerned with fintech companies.  “Veteran bankers have seen the ups and downs of business. Their experience can help fintech companies decide their growth plans,” said Sinha.  For instance, Kumar's tenure as the chairman of SBI ended in October 2020, following which he joined BharatPe, and later in 2022, also became an advisor to Indifi. Kumar, while highlighting his role as the advisor, said that most of the fintech companies are young at less than five to six years.  &quot;As an advisor, we give them guidance. Especially, at this stage we give them advice not only on regulatory issues but also on compliance and other growth operations,&quot; said Kumar.  Alok Mittal, CEO of Indifi Technologies, said that hiring veteran bankers who have witnessed industry evolutions through the years help the fintech companies in adapting the business to new paradigms.  “Hiring former bankers and fintech experts can lead to a powerful combination towards growth.

The woman, identified as Surya Harijan, was struggling to withdraw money due to her broken fingers.  After the video was shared by news agency ANI, the State Bank of India (SBI) responded and assured the pensioner that her pension would be delivered to her doorstep going forward. The nearest link branch, SBI Jharigaon, Odisha immediately paid the pension amount by debiting the amount manually from her account.  The branch manager of SBI Jharigaon stated that Surya Harijan used to withdraw her old-age pension from a CSP point situated in her village every month. However, due to her old age, her fingerprints were not matching at the CSP point. She visited the Jharigaon branch with her relative, and the branch manager paid the amount by manually debiting her account. They have also decided to hand over a wheelchair to the elderly woman.  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted the video and expressed her concern about the situation. She urged the authorities to act humanely and help the elderly woman. SBI responded to the minister, stating that they are equally pained to see the video and that they have resolved the issue by providing doorstep delivery of her pension and a wheelchair.

Apart from SBI, the government has asked for data from Punjab National Bank (PNB), and Bank of Baroda (BoB), said people familiar with the development.  &quot;The government has asked only major banks such as SBI, PNB, and BoB to submit data on their respective bond portfolios to check their status. It is also obvious that the government will not seek this information from banks that have small portfolios. These include Bank of Maharashtra, Punjab and Sindh, etc,&quot; told a source to Moneycontrol.  The move assumes significance as sharp value erosion in the bond portfolios of banks like Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in long-term securities had caused the crisis in the US, which led to the collapse of at least three regional banks in the US.  “But in India, there's a limit on bonds for availability and selling. This is the main reason we will not face the United States-like crisis in India. So, the FM has simply asked the details of bonds from the Indian public sector banks for caution,&quot; one of the persons quoted above said.  This directive has come ahead of the scheduled meeting between finance ministry and public sector lenders on March 25 to take stock of the industry growth.  Bankers confirmed about the meeting, but said Indian banks are in a strong position.  “Indian banks are in a very strong position.

SBI,2023-03-14T17:25:19+05:30,Moneycontrol News,SBI to hike key lending rate by 70 bps to 14.85% effective March 15,The state-run lender will also be raising its base rate by 70 bps to 10.10 percent.,"The State Bank of India (SBI), the country's largest public sector lender, will hike the benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by 70 basis points with effect from March 15.  The 0.7 percent jump in the key lending rate will push it to 14.85 percent.  SBI will also be raising its base rate by 70 bps to 10.10 percent effective from March 15. The lender had last made an upward revision in BPLR and base rate on December 15.  The hike has been announced by SBI a month after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised the repo rate, or the rate at which it lends short-term funds to commercial banks, to 6.50 percent from 6.25 percent.  While SBI has increased BPLR and its base rate, the bank has not made any changes to its marginal cost lending rate (MCLR), at which it lends out loans to customers.  SBI had last raised MCLR by 10 bps on February 15, which led to the overnight marginal cost lending rate increasing to 7.95 percent from 7.85 percent, and one-month and three-month MCLR rising to 8.10 percent from 8.00 percent, respectively.  The jump in lending rates is seen as a ripple effect of the rate hikes being implemented by the Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI since mid-last year, in a bid to tame inflation.  The countrywide retail inflation eased to 6.44 percent in February 2023, but continues to remain above the RBI's upper-level tolerance limit of 6 percent.

SBI,2023-02-08T09:36:16+05:30,Vaibhavi Ranjan,"Hindalco tops optimism as China reopens, financials remain Street's top sectoral pick","Out of the 10 stocks that analysts were most optimistic about, 5 came from the financial space.","Hindalco Industries was the frontrunner among the list of stocks that analysts were most optimistic about in January, even though financial companies occupied half of the list.  When it came to the list of stocks that analysts on the Street were most pessimistic about, information technology counters were the clear winners as four out of the five frontline large-cap IT stocks made it to the list. The list was however, topped by JSW Steel, as per  Bloomberg's Analyst Call Tracker for January.  Strong credit growth sparks optimism  Optimism for banking stocks hinged on the strong credit growth and improved asset quality in the sector.  Robust loan growth, strong recovery in demand for working capital and sustained asset quality which comforted lenders to lend more are the key factors behind the bullishness as stated by analysts.  Even though concerns of an economic slowdown in the country are running  high, brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities does not expect much impact on the asset quality of banks. . &quot;We are seeing a strong recovery in loan growth after nearly a decade, suggesting that if there is a slowdown in the near term, the impact on asset quality should be low,&quot; the brokerage said in its report.  &quot;We shall keep our positive view on the sector, even if the probability of growth slowing down from current levels is high,&quot; Kotak Institutional Equities added.  Out of the 10 stocks that analysts were most optimistic about, 5 came from the financial space. State Bank of India, SBI Life Insurance Co, ICICI Bank, Housing Development Finance Corp and Axis Bank  enjoyed optimism scores ranging from 95 to 98 as the sector cinched the throne of the Street's darling.  We define optimism scores as the percentage of sell-side analysts who have a “buy&quot; call on the respective stock.  Hindalco Industries emerges winner  The world's largest metal importer, China reopened its borders after three years which has sparked expectations of a demand revival and aided outlook for industry major Hindalco Industries.  Global research and broking firm CLSA Asia Pacific Markets believes that a faster reopening in China and stimulus for its battered property sector has provided a new lease of life for metal companies, although on-ground demand improvement is still elusive.  On account of the aforementioned reasons, CLSA was among the list of 24 brokerages that gave a Buy call for Hindalco Industries.  The broking firm also raised its price target for the aluminium major by 12.6 percent to factor in expectations of improved demand. All 24 brokerages covering Hindalco Industries have given a Buy rating to the stock, taking its optimism score to 100.  Pessimism clouds JSW Steel, IT stocks  January was yet another month when analysts failed to see a bright light around JSW Steel and other major IT counters. JSW Steel, Wipro and Divi's Laboratories were the top three stocks where analysts' pessimism ran the highest. Pessimism score refers to the percentage of analysts that have a &quot;hold&quot; or &quot;sell&quot; rating on the stock.  JSW Steel had the highest number of Sell ratings at 19, a number which is more than three times the number of Buy calls which stand at 6. Expensive stock valuations and higher levels of debt are the prime concerns dragging sentiment for the stock. Despite expectations of improved earnings due to the reopening of China, many analysts believe that expensive stock valuations will factor in any positive quarterly results for JSW Steel.  Also Read: Analyst Call Tracker: Why are fireworks missing for JSW Steel even as China reopens  On the other hand, four frontline IT majors- Wipro, HCL Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services and Tech Mahindra also failed to garner much bullishness from analysts. As dark clouds of a possible recession in the US and Europe gather pace, concerns of a sharp slowdown in growth for domestic IT companies is weighing on the sector.  &quot;After the 3Q results of IT companies so far, we expect aggregate revenue for Indian IT firms to sharply moderate in the next financial year. Our growth assumptions are lower than the street and as growth expectations moderate, further derating in PE multiples is likely as seen in the past. Moreover, the Nifty IT index is still trading at an above-average premium of 17% to the Nifty 50 as its valuations remain rich,&quot; Jefferies said in a note.  Index heavyweight Infosys remains the only IT stock that enjoys a Buy call from the global research and broking firm.  Also Read: Analyst Call Tracker: How Infosys bucked the pessimistic outlook for IT cos  An unexpected participant  A surprise element in the list of stocks that garnered optimism among analysts on the Street was Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone. The stock had an optimism score of 95 as 20 out of the 21 brokerages covering the scrip had a Buy call.  Analysts were bullish on the stock as the company is the largest commercial port operator in India with 25% share of port cargo movement in India.  &quot;We upgrade Adani Ports to Outperform (from Neutral) based on attractive valuations post its recent correction. Strong underlying business with a robust growth outlook provide downside support,&quot; broking firm Credit Suisse said in its report.  Aside from Credit Suisse, Kotak Institutional Equities was another brokerage house that upgraded its rating for Adani Ports to factor in a favourable risk reward on the back of the recent landslide in the stock.  &quot;Adani Ports is a strong play on India’s port sector, having attractive characteristics – pricing power, prospects of privatization. The company also has a strong right to win in offering an end-to-end logistics offering,&quot; Kotak Institutional Equities said in its report.  Another interesting fact to note is that despite their ratings upgrades, both Credit Suisse and Kotak Institutional Equities have slashed their respective target prices for the scrip. While Credit Suisse lowered its target price for Adani Ports by around 11 percent, Kotak Institutional Equities cut its target price by 6.5 percent.

SBI had disclosed that its total loan exposure to the Adani Group stood at 0.88 percent, or Rs 270 billion, of total loans as of the quarter that ended in December. Most of these loans are secured against cash-generating assets, and no loans against shares have been provided to the group.  &quot;We see the level of exposure as well-manageable for SBI given its strong general provision reserves buffer (Rs 338 billion or 1 percent of net loans) and PPOP generation capability – the Rs 270-billion exposure is equivalent to 34 percent of annualised 9MFY23 PPOP,&quot; the credit researcher said in a note.  PPOP, or pre-provision operating profit, is the amount of income a bank earns in a given time period, before taking into account funds set aside to provide for future bad debts.  The report further noted that most of the bank’s exposure to the group is secured by completed and cash-generating assets, while the remaining are to projects that are still under construction and are on schedule.  &quot;The bank also has some nonfunded exposure, but this comprises letters of credit and bank guarantees and does not relate to equity raising or acquisition activities,&quot; it said.  The SBI loan exposure to Adani Group came in focus after a report by an American short-seller, Hindenberg Research, alleged accounting fraud and stock market manipulation by the conglomerate. It hammered Adani Group stocks wiping over $100 billion from the market value.  Last week, SBI Chairman Dinesh Khara clarified that the bank does not envisage the ports-to-mining group facing any challenge to service its debt obligations.  Adding that the group has an excellent repayment record, Khara said that lending to Adani Group projects is with regard to having tangible assets and adequate cash flows.  SBI has reported net profit growth of 49 percent on-year to Rs 335 billion in the December quarter, driven by higher net interest income (NII) and lower provisions.  The stock fell over 10 percent in the week after the Hindenberg Research report was published on January 24.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/adani-group-loan-sbi-well-manageable-for-sbi-creditsights-10019691.html

Concerning its exposure to the Adani Group, private sector lender IndusInd Bank in a statement on February 1 clarified its exposure.  In a statement it said: &quot;Bank's exposure towards this Group is as follows: 1. The total loan outstanding towards the Group is at 0.49 percent of the bank's loan book. 2.

SBI,2023-02-03T08:02:37+05:30,Moneycontrol News,SBI Q3 Earnings Preview: Net profit to jump 58% on robust loan growth,Analysts expect State Bank of India's interest income to be buttressed by robust loan growth and stable net interest margins.,"The State Bank of India (SBI) is expected to report a 58 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in net profit for the December quarter on the back of a drop in provisions, and a healthy 24 percent growth in net interest income.  The average estimate of a poll of eight brokerages by Moneycontrol puts SBI’s net profit at Rs 13,360 crore for the quarter, up from Rs 8,431.9 crore in the corresponding period a year ago. Net interest income (NII) is expected to be Rs 36,948 crore compared with Rs 30,687 crore a year ago. SBI will detail its quarterly results on February 3.  Analysts expect the bank’s interest income to be buttressed by robust loan growth and stable net interest margins (NIM). Analysts at ICICI Securities expect the loan growth to be 20 percent, while Kotak Institutional Equities is expecting a loan growth of 18 percent. Both the retail and corporate loan book may show strong expansion, according to analysts.  Stable margins may also contribute to the growth in net interest income. Kotak analysts estimate margins to improve by 10 basis points (bps) sequentially. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The lender’s loan mix, along with a large portfolio of low-cost current and savings deposits, should contribute to margin improvement.  “Forty-one percent of SBI’s lending portfolio is linked to MCLR, 34 percent is EBLR-linked, 21 percent is fixed rate, and the rest is BPLR, base rate, etc. Bulk of the MCLR-linked portfolio is with a six-month reset. Given this profile, while partial benefit of rate transmission was reflected in Q2FY23, the entire benefit should be visible in H2FY23,” analysts at ICICI Securities wrote in a note.  Asset quality  A drop in stressed assets (hence lower provisioning needs) is another contributor to the robust bottomline growth. Kotak estimates fresh slippages to be contained at around Rs 7,500 crore for the December quarter, and that too mostly from small business and retail loans. The corporate loan book is likely to be resilient. In the September quarter, SBI had reported slippages of Rs 2,399 crore.  Loan resolutions may ensure that upgrades and recoveries hold up, although these may slow sequentially. Upgrades and recoveries amounted to Rs 5,207 crore during the September quarter.  The lender’s provisions would be towards fresh slippages and to keep the coverage ratio elevated. Analysts do not foresee any large mark-to-market hit on the bank’s investment portfolio. This would ensure that operating profit growth is at a healthy 24 percent for the December quarter. Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher have increased their earnings estimate for SBI by 6.5 percent for the whole of FY23 in anticipation of lower provisions.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/sbi-q3-earnings-preview-net-profit-to-jump-58-on-robust-loan-growth-9995751.html

","Economists at the country's largest lender SBI on Monday dismissed the 'K-shaped recovery' critique, saying the pandemic was a 'leveler' which helped in reducing inequalities.  They said government transfers to the poor alone are adding up to Rs 75,000 per household per annum.  It can be noted that in the months following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns were being raised about deepening inequalities in India, with some calling it as a 'K-shaped' recovery, where rich emerged richer while the poor slipped down further.  After analysing data and studies, the SBI economists said, &quot;in hindsight, the pandemic may have been a leveller in terms of inequality with the poor getting protected through measures such as food transfers.&quot; It said India has delivered a sharp recovery after the pandemic and acknowledged that critics are still quoting it as a K-shaped recovery for India.  &quot;It is true that the strong rise in financial assets resulted in an increase in inequality in 2021. However, when correlated with short-run asset price movements, such fluctuations in inequality always prove transient,&quot; the report explained.  &quot;In the Indian context, it is an incorrect conjecture to assume that inequality has worsened during the pandemic,&quot; it added, citing its study on how cereal procurement has helped reduce inequality.  The report said a higher procurement is benefitting the poorest of the poor in terms of subsequent free distribution of foodgrains, and also helping put money in the hands of smaller and marginal farmers, with distributional impact.  &quot;With a progressive growth in output across states as proxied by GSDP, it is clear that the fruits of such a growth have clearly reverberated and dovetailed into an inclusive growth.  &quot;India has thus done quite well during pandemic in terms of navigating income shocks across deciles of population,&quot; the study said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/no-k-shaped-recovery-in-india-pandemic-a-leveler-to-reduce-inequality-sbi-economists-9836771.html

Banks need to set aside money to cover potential losses from such loans. This impacts the profitability of banks.   ,"Country's largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI) wrote off loans worth Rs 1.65 lakh crore in last four fiscal years followed by Punjab National Bank (PNB) which wrote off Rs59,807 crore, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman  informed the Parliament on December 12.  SBI wrote off Rs 19,666 crore loans in fiscal year 2021-2022, Rs 34,402 crore in 2020-21, Rs 52362 crore in 2019-20 and Rs 58905 crore in 2018-2019, according to the data submitted by the finance minister.  Banks typically write off loans where there is no scope of recovery . Banks need to set aside money to cover potential losses from such loans. This impacts the profitability of banks.  The borrowers of written-off loans continue to be liable for repayment and the process of recovery of dues from the borrower in written-off loan accounts continues.

Among private sector banks, ICICI Bank wrote off Rs42,164 crores of loans while HDFC Bank wrote off Rs31,516 crore loans.

The primary dispute is about whether the new owners of Jet Airways need to pay more money into the pension funds of ex-employees, the people said, asking not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.  Banks, led by State Bank of India, say Jet Airways’ new buyers — Dubai-based businessman Murari Lal Jalan and Florian Fritsch, chairman of London-based Kalrock Capital Management Ltd. — should pay an additional 2.5 billion rupees ($30.1 million) into the retirement kitty, the people said, an ask supported by the email exchanges reviewed by Bloomberg.  The new owners meanwhile have indicated that extra money wasn’t part of the already agreed upon resolution plan and instead must be taken out of the banks’ dues, the people said. All parties are now awaiting fresh guidance from the bankruptcy court due Tuesday, the people said.  A representative for Jet Airways, which also represents the consortium led by Jalan and Fritsch, declined to comment. State Bank of India and Ashish Chhawchharia, the court-appointed professional running the carrier’s insolvency, didn’t immediately respond to messages and phone calls seeking comment.  A revival of Jet Airways, previously majority owned by former billionaire Naresh Goyal, is key to burnish the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is projecting himself as a market-friendly leader keen to reduce state interference in private enterprise ahead of elections in 2024.  For Jet Airways, a second coming could exemplify how new bankruptcy rules can allow beleaguered carriers to spring back in the South Asian nation, known for its cut-throat aviation market and fare wars that have killed off several high profile players over the years.  Jet Airways collapsed in 2019 under a lot of debt after years as India’s top private airline. It had promised to start flying again in March this year but has struggled to order new aircraft because lenders have been reluctant to take on fresh liabilities. Its new owners also still haven’t reached an agreement about formally taking over the airline, the people familiar with the matter said, limiting the ability of Jalan and Fritsch to infuse more funds and order planes.  The issue of paying more money into the pension funds of former employees came about after a fresh case was filed at the tribunal after the court-approved resolution had been finalized.  The snag also threatens to set back a process of about three years that was to see banks recover about 5% of the some 78.1 billion rupees they were owed.  Bloomberg News reported in late August that Jet Airways was in advanced talks to order about 50 Airbus SE A220 aircraft. The carrier was also in discussions with Boeing Co. and Airbus to potentially place a “sizable” order for the 737 Max or A320neo families of jets. All those discussions are now stuck due to this latest dispute, one of the people said.  Another point of contention is whether ownership should be transfered to the new owners before a court rules on the current pending matters. Banks aren’t willing to let that happen and Jalan and Fritsch aren’t willing to put in any more funds until they know when they’ll actually be in control of the airline, the emails show.  Still another wrinkle centers around a dispute over Jet Airways’ landing and parking slots at airports in India and overseas. Banks want Jalan and Fritsch to confirm the slots but Indian regulators aren’t making that possible until there is more clarity on Jet Airways’ fleet, according to the emails.  To date, Jalan and Fritsch have spent about 7.6 billion rupees in their attempts to get Jet Airways flying again, the emails show.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/jet-airways-revival-hits-new-snag-as-banks-push-back-on-funding-9659321.html

SBI,2022-11-30T16:57:56+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Why Saurabh Mukherjea is not a fan of PSU Banks,The founder of Marcellus Investment Managers shuns stocks where the return on equity is consistently below the cost of equity.,"Public sector banks have been in huge demand in recent months, thanks in part to their improving financial performance but Saurabh Mukherjea, the founder of Marcellus Investment Managers, is not a fan.  “For a typical public sector bank, the return on equity is consistently below the cost of equity, which means value generation is zero. And that’s reflected in the five-year and 10-year share price movement, which is zero,” Mukherjea told Moneycontrol.  The Nifty PSU Bank index, a representative measure of public sector bank shares, has advanced 55 percent so far in 2022, with most of the gains kicking in since September. However, it delivered only a 6 percent return over the past five years.  Many PSU Banks, especially State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank, have delivered superlative quarterly numbers in the September quarter, riding on better credit growth and higher recoveries. A decline in bad loans also improved their outlook.  However, the trend hasn’t been consistent. Most lower-tier banks such as Punjab National Bank are still plagued with high levels of toxic debt. The market has disregarded this and has bought PSU banks indiscriminately.  Mukherjea said the returns look respectable in the short term because prices had plunged significantly during Covid-19. But public sector banks have not made money in the long run, he said.  Some value  However, he is not bearish on every public sector bank. He sees some value in SBI, which reported better-than-expected earnings in the September quarter. The lender has improved its performance consistently over several quarters and its stock has also appreciated.  Also read: PSU banks an attractive play, stick to the strong ones, says this wealth manager  “I think a lot of credit should go to Arundhati Bhattacharya (the former chairperson of the bank) for improving the efficiency and quality of the bank,” said Mukherjea. “Will SBI continue doing well, going forward? I think so because the worst excesses of crony capitalism seem to be behind us. Provided the kind of mass destruction of the SBI balance sheet, which happened a decade ago, doesn't happen again, I think SBI should be a decent compounder going forward.”  Mukherjea, who is heavily invested in HDFC Bank via the funds he runs, will not be buying PSU banks, including SBI, because he does not see them compounding at a rate of 20 percent, which is his threshold.  Other PSUs ‘fragile’  Mukherjea refuted the notion that the quality pack, which refers to companies that rely on traditional business models to consistently generate high cash and return ratios, may see some kind of moderation compared to cyclical or public sector companies.  In the past 12 months, such quality plays have not performed well when compared to public sector institutions, whether they make defence equipment or give loans, which have had a great run.  “I can't deny that,” said Mukherjea, adding that he still stays away from such companies because there is “no business engine” there. While they might be having their moment in the sun, it will not be long term, according to him.  “If you take a typical public sector institution, the return on capital (RoC) will be significantly below cost of capital. If your RoC is below cost of capital, whether you are a metal and mining company or a public sector company, you're not generating a surplus. If you can’t generate a surplus, you cannot grow your business,” he said.  The star fund manager said he continues to focus on companies that generate cashflows.  “The basic tenet of investing is to look for companies which make free cashflow. And then if they become cheap, buy tons of it,” he said.

He said SBI, which won investors' confidence after posting stellar quarterly earnings recently, will be able to maintain net non-performing assets under 1 per cent going forward as well.  Speaking at an economics conclave organised by SBI, Khara also exuded confidence that the country's banking system will be able to maintain its high loan growth as banks have internalised learnings from the last high growth cycle.  In the last high growth cycle immediately after the global financial crisis, there was a huge spurt in sour loans, and it took the RBI's intervention to clean up banks' balance sheets through asset quality review.  Banks do not stop just at insistence on equity, but also look at the colour of the equity to ensure that hybrid debt does not masquerade as core equity, Khara said, stressing that banks are better placed from a loan underwriting and pricing of risk perspective now.  The decision-making is more scientific and banks are also well capitalised now, he said, adding, &quot;the banking system is much better placed, growth that we are seeing is sustainable too&quot;.  The banking system, which had struggled to take the annual growth into double digits for multiple years, witnessed a credit growth of 17 per cent for the fortnight ended November 4.  SBI had been focused on corporate loan quality for some time now, and has also started a system where it gets early signals about distress in a retail loan as well courtesy a strong analytics engine, he told reporters.  Khara said corporates are also deleveraged, unlike the last instance when their balance sheets had huge loans, he said. In the case of SBI, he said the bank is carrying provisions for over 90 per cent of its corporate loan book.  When quizzed about the current war for deposits, he said lenders which are running high credit-deposit (CD) ratios of over 75 per cent are forced to give high interest of over 8 per cent to garner deposits. He said that SBI's CD ratio is 65 per cent.  He said banks are also carrying excess government security investments, which can be liquidated to bridge the liquidity needs, and ensure that the productive sectors get loans.  Changes in the ecosystem are proving of big help to the lenders, Khara said, pointing to strengths like bankruptcy code, Goods and Service Tax Network data, ratings ecosystem and credit bureaus.  The expectation is to grow the GDP to USD 40 trillion by 2047, which Khara termed as a &quot;mammoth task&quot;.  The focus is on infrastructure-led growth during this period, he said, adding that building this requires deep debt markets which are not present in India right now.

Besides Khara, the panel comprised L&amp;amp;T CFO Shankar Raman; Managing Director of Crisil Ratings Gurpreet Chhatwal; CEO of Technocrat Navneet Kumar Saraf; Joint MD of JSW Steel Seshagiri Rao; and Founder and CEO of Jupiter Jitendra Gupta.  Khara said in the current fiscal year, India is standing as the brightest star across the globe and the same is being replicated in the performance of the banking sector.  Chhatwal spoke about the bond market, which has been a bit of a challenge for the last 18 months. &quot;Today, banks are doing the heavy lifting, we are creating building blocks within the bond market for that growth,&quot; he said, adding that the bond markets have matured significantly in terms of investors that are coming in, the quality of paper that is coming in, the infrastructure financials, etc.  Raman said India is in a unique place in terms of growth. &quot;We went through the turmoils of the last two years rather well. That has given us a sense of self belief,&quot; he said. Everyone believes that India is in a good position to dream about its aspirations over the next 25 years, he added. &quot;The name Amrit Kaal is fitting because it does say how we feel about India,&quot; he said.  Saraf and Rao spoke about India's role as manufacturers. Rao said this is the first time the manufacturing sector is being used to its hilt —it is at a three-year high. &quot;When the manufacturing sector is creating capacity in India, it is not only for India it is also for export markets,&quot; he said, adding that when countries across the globe are concerned about recession, India is growing at the rate of 6-7 percent.  Saraf said for India to achieve its target of $5-trillion GDP in the next three years, export competitiveness would play an important role. &quot;With the China + 1 policy that is prevalent, I think it is a great opportunity for India to expand manufacturing exports,&quot; he said, adding that better availability of raw material would help.  Gupta said for India to cross $40 trillion by 2024, support from non-linear growth (internet economy) is just as important compared to linear growth (infrastructure, exports, manufacturing, etc). He felt that the digitisation of infrastructure currently on — with the introduction of 5G — would give a clear boost to the $40-trillion goal.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/9th-sbi-banking-economics-conclave-experts-bullish-about-indian-economys-amrit-kaal-9590111.html

The Pune-headquartered lender recorded 28.62 per cent increase in gross advances at Rs 1,48,216 crore at the end of September 2022, according to published quarterly numbers of public sector banks (PSBs).  It was followed by Union Bank of India with 21.54 per cent growth to Rs 7,52,469 crore. The country's largest lender State Bank of India stood at third spot with 18.15 per cent jump in gross advances.  However, SBI's total loans were about 17 times higher at Rs 25,47,390 crore as compared to Rs 1,48,216 crore of BoM in absolute terms.  With regard to Retail-Agriculture-MSME (RAM) loans, BoM recorded the highest growth of 22.31 per cent followed by Bank of Baroda with 19.53 per cent and SBI at 16.51 per cent during the period under review.  As far as low-cost Current Account Savings Account (CASA) deposits are concerned, BoM topped the chart with 56.27 per cent followed by Canara Bank at 50.99 per cent.  BoM and SBI with 3.55 per cent Net Interest Margin (NIM), a key profitability parameter, stood at the top among PSBs. It was followed by Bank of India at 3.49 per cent and Central Bank of India at 3.44 per cent.  BoM and SBI were in the lowest quartile as far as gross non-performing assets (NPAs) and net NPAs were concerned, according to an analysis of the quarterly financial numbers published by public sector lenders.

SBI,2022-11-11T10:35:26+05:30,Aparna Iyer,SBI: Is the elephant dancing on a tin can?,"Growth in lending means the bank will need capital, which analysts say is the next stage that is critical for a rerating of the stock.","State Bank of India has never had it better when it comes to investor love. The stock has zoomed 15 percent in three months, outpacing the broad market and leaving its peers far behind.  This is not irrational exuberance – it is an acknowledgement of the country’s largest lender finally shaking off the shackles of bad loans and going full throttle on lending.  With growth comes the need for capital to fund it and this is the next stage that analysts say will be critical for another rerating of the SBI stock.  SBI has a ‘buy’ rating from almost all brokerages, with most of them having rerated it in the past two years. Despite the scorching gains so far, the shares trade at a modest 1.5 times the one-year forward book value.  “For SBI, most of the positives have been priced in but there is still a lot of upside for the stock,” said Gaurav Jani, an analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher. That brings us back to the factor that will determine how fast SBI can hold on to its valuation gains and surge even further ahead.  Drop some money SBI’s capital adequacy ratio was 13.51 percent in September, higher than the regulatory requirement of 12 percent and marginally above 13.35 percent a year ago.  Note that during this time, the lender’s toxic loan book dropped sharply, lowering its provisioning needs. It also raised capital from the bond market. SBI’s quarterly profits have risen consistently. Still, the rather modest increase in its capital ratio shows credit growth has burned through most internal accruals.  What’s more, chairman Dinesh Khara expects this loan growth momentum to continue, depending on the strength of the economy’s expansion. He has pencilled in loan expansion of as much as 16 percent for FY23.  Long story short, SBI needs to raise capital and analysts at JM Financial gauge that the money should come over the next 1-2 years.  The capital must be Tier-1 because the bank’s Common Equity Tier-1 capital ratio is at 9.53 percent, against a minimum requirement of 8.6 percent.  “While SBI may need to raise equity capital over the next 12-24 months (CET1 at 9.5%), stake sale in subsidiaries (SBI Funds, SBI General Insurance) remains another option to augment capital and may delay the eventual dilution,” JM Financial analysts said.  But Khara poured hot water over the prospects of a stake sale by saying recently that the listing of SBI Mutual Fund is now on the backburner. There is no clarity on whether the general insurance arm will go public.  Mind the deposit gap SBI’s deposit growth (10 percent) was just half of its loan growth (20 percent) for the September quarter. This should worry the bank on its liquidity position and its ability to lend with the same gusto that it does now.  If the 10 percentage point gap between credit and deposit growth persists, it could significantly crimp the bank’s ability to lend.  Granted, the bank’s deposit franchise is unparalleled and its ‘Safe bank of India’ tag will ensure a steady inflow. But the question is whether this is enough.  What helps SBI on liquidity is its practice of keeping a big buffer through liquid assets such as government bonds. Its liquidity coverage ratio at 132.6 percent instils confidence. Even so, the wide wedge between deposit and loan growth underscores the need for growth capital.  The prospects of the country’s largest bank are bright in the capital market and analysts see valuations only improving from here on. The comparatively modest multiples only make SBI a more appealing stock to buy.  Since some of this is also due to an uncertainty premium that sticks to large and safe businesses, SBI needs to sustain its growth and profitability momentum.

Every USD 10 increase in crude prices impacts the Current Account Deficit (CAD) to the tune of 40 basis points while the same on fuel inflation is 50 bps and also results in 23 bps decline in growth, according to Soumyakanti Ghosh, the chief economic advisor at SBI.  CAD has a counter cyclical shock absorber, he said in a report on Thursday. Exchange rate is the major contributor to software exports growth and 40 per cent of its variation is explained by exchange rates.  ”If we translated these numbers in actual terms, every Re 1 fall against the dollar leads to an increase in software exports by USD 250 million”. This, along with an expected USD 5 billion-forex reserve accrual by way of swap transactions and higher remittances, will cap CAD at 3 per cent of GDP as against the average lowest level projected for the year at 3.5 per cent, Ghosh said.  The strong remittances and software exports have lowered CAD by 60 bps in the June quarter, adding that if this trends continued in the September quarter, then CAD would be below 3.5 per cent in the second quarter and at 3 per cent in the full fiscal.  Even otherwise, the chances of it exceeding 3.5 per cent of GDP are minimal, he added. According to Ghosh, forex reserves, which have declined from USD 642 billion in September 2021 to just about USD 531 billion last week, are expected to rise by USD 5 billion as swap transactions reverse.  The biggest impact on CAD is oil imports, which form as much as 30 per cent of the country’s import bills. Therefore, any increase in oil price has a direct impact on the trade deficit by increasing the import bill and consequently widening the CAD.  Software exports have been rising with the share of offsite mode of exports of software services by domestic IT services companies soaring to 88.8 per cent in FY22 from 82.8 per cent five years ago.  Ghosh said that a positive shock to oil prices leads to immediate and sharp increase in CAD but the same dissipates completely in about eight quarters. In case of GDP, positive fall in oil prices leads to immediate decline which, however, starts reversing after three quarters and completely dissipates after the seventh quarter.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/current-account-deficit-likely-to-be-lower-at-3-this-fiscal-says-sbi-report-9491161.html
SBI,2022-11-08T14:39:35+05:30,PTI,SBI report says banks inadequately pricing risks as they scurry to garner deposits and lend more,Liquidity crunch is primarily because the Reserve Bank has been sucking out funds from the system as it fights to tame inflation which has been much above its band of 4 per cent for the past 10 months of the year.,"Amidst liquidity tightening and a decadal high credit growth of over 18 per cent and deposit growth falling way behind, a report has warned that banks are not adequately pricing their risks from both asset and liabilities sides.  Liquidity crunch is primarily because the Reserve Bank has been sucking out funds from the system as it fights to tame inflation which has been much above its band of 4 per cent for the past 10 months of the year.  This has prompted the RBI to frontload its inflation fight by increasing the policy rates by 190 basis points to pre-pandemic levels since the war on Ukraine began.  The average net durable liquidity injected into the banking system in April 2022 was Rs 8.3 lakh crore, which is nearly a third of that now at Rs 3 lakh crore.  Atop this, the government has spent a large part of its cash balances in the Diwali week, and as a result the net LAF (liquidity adjust facility) in the system, which was hitherto negative, has improved of late. Bonus payments by the government and the private sector also helped.  Even as the banking system has moved closer to a calibrated liquidity coupled with higher signaling rates, one thing has still not changed is that credit risks are not getting adequately priced in, even as credit demand is at a decadal high and liquidity remains significantly downsized, argues Soumya Kanti Ghosh, the group chief economic adviser at the State Bank of India, in a report.  According to the report, what is still intriguing, however, is that even as the banking system is witnessing net LAF deficit, market sources point out that risk premia over and above core funding cost are not fairly acknowledging the inherent credit risk.  For example, short tenor working capital loans for less than one year are given at lower than 6 per cent and are linked to one-month/three-month T-bill rates, while 10- and 15-year loans are being priced at less than 7 per cent.  It is to be noted that 10-year G-Sec is currently trading around 7.46 per cent, while the 91-day T-bill is trading at around 6.44 per cent and 364-day T-bill at around 6.97 per cent.  The average core funding cost of the banking system is at around 6.2 per cent now, while the reverse repo rate is at 5.65 per cent. No wonder, banks are currently engaged in a fierce war to raise deposits, with rates being offered up to 7.75 per cent in select maturities.  Additionally, banks are now mobilising certificates of deposit (CDs) at rates as high has 7.97 per cent for a 360 days paper. Further, a few banks have raised CDs at 7.15 per cent for 92 days.  Thus a significant part of the funding gap is also being made up by CD mobilisation. The outstanding CDs stood at Rs 2.41 lakh crore on October 21, compared to just Rs 0.57 lakh crore a year ago.  The CP market is also witnessing significant churn with primary issuances of the short-term paper coming down drastically to Rs 0.78 lakh crore after touching a high of around Rs 2.9 lakh crore in November 2021.  The yields have also increased by 255 basis points (bps) since April 2022 and was at 6.92 per cent in October 2022, he says in the report.  The report also notes that the good thing is that such pricing war for both fund raising and lending is mostly restricted to AAA-rated borrowers and ultimately it should also lower the risk weighted assets thereby lowering the capital requirements.  To nudge large borrowers to move towards corporate bonds market, the RBI had mooted the idea of normally permitted lending limit (NPLL) for them. But the current pricing trend is negating both this concept as well as the logic of tenor premium. Ideally, benchmark yields should move down if the risk is underpriced.  Interestingly, banks have adjusted deposit rates significantly upwards in October. Also, given that 45 per cent of bank deposits are the low-cost CASA (current account savings account), it is only the 55 per cent of the term deposits that need adjustments and hence ideally, the 190 bps increase in the repo rate could result in 105 bps increase in the deposit rates of the latter category.  Banks with better franchise and digital orientation will ensure that retail deposits triumph over wholesale deposit mobilisation in the long-run, coupled with the fact that meeting the liquidity coverage ratio or the LCR norms is the exclusive prerogative of mobilising only through retail deposits.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-report-says-banks-inadequately-pricing-risks-as-they-scurry-to-garner-deposits-and-lend-more-9468701.html

That is why we had a strong credit growth. But I still expect, going by the current trend, we should have credit growth of 14-16 percent in the current financial year,” Khara said at a press briefing in Mumbai post the announcement of the bank's July-September results.  ALSO READ: State Bank of India Q2FY23 earnings: Here are top five takeaways  He elaborated that within corporate loans, SBI is seeing capex-related demand while capacity utilisation is showing signs of improvement. The country's largest lender is seeing demand from infrastructure, renewable power, oil and marketing companies and services sectors, he added.  SBI’s credit growth jumped nearly 20 percent year-on-year in the fiscal second quarter, with domestic advances growing 18.15 percent. The growth in domestic advances was driven by corporate advances followed by retail personal loans.  Indian banks are recovering from the COVID-19 crisis, which rendered many Indians jobless. Now that the economy is recovering, credit offtake has improved significantly. To fund this credit growth, banks are mobilising deposits at a faster pace amid tight banking system liquidity.  When asked about deposit growth for SBI, Khara said that much of it will be depend on how the industry grows.  “I can only say that we will not be seen lagging behind industry,” said Khara.  In terms of guidance on bad loans, the Chairman said that SBI’s endeavour will be to keep bad loan ratios “as low as possible” with divulging any number. The bank’s restructuring book currently stands at Rs 27,336 crore and is behaving “very well,” he said.  Further, the bank has 14 offers for bad loan accounts transferred to the National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (NARCL). Progress in loan accounts transferred to NARCL has been happening at a “rapid pace,” said Khara. He did not elaborate on the recovery expected from these accounts.  Q2 results:  Earlier on November 5, SBI reported a net profit of Rs 13,264 crore for the September quarter, a surge of 74 percent from a year earlier on improved asset quality and healthy loan growth.  The state-run lender’s profit beat street estimates by a mile. A Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerages had forecast net profit to be Rs 10,616.2 crore.

The state-run lender’s profit beat street estimates by a mile. A Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerages had forecast net profit to be Rs 10,616.2 crore. While the sharp increase in quarterly profit comes from a healthy core interest income growth owing to a smart increase in credit expansion, there is a base effect at play also.  ALSO READ: State Bank of India Q2FY23 earnings: Here are top five takeaways  In the September quarter of FY22, SBI had made exceptional provision of Rs 7,418 crore towards employee pension costs which had dented its profits then. Ergo, the net profit growth for September quarter in the current year shows a larger increase.  Nevertheless, loan growth of 20 percent year-on-year lifted core interest income and also operating profit growth. SBI reported a 16.8 percent increase in its operating profit for the September quarter. Sequentially, the increase in operating profit was a sharp 65.6 percent.  The largest Indian lender's net interest income rose 12.83 percent to Rs 35,183 crore for the reported quarter, keeping with the improving trend of the previous two quarters. The bank’s interest earned rose 15 percent to Rs 79,859.59 crore while interest expended was Rs 44,676.15 crore, up from Rs 38,298 crore a year ago.  Asset quality shines  SBI’s gross non-performing assets were 3.52 percent of the total loan book, down from 4.90 percent a year ago. This is the lowest NPA ratio reported by the bank since FY12. The total gross bad loan pile reduced by 14 percent year-on-year and now stands at Rs 1.06 lakh crore.  In essence, a reduction in bad loan pile as well as a sharper loan growth has improved asset quality ratios in a big way. On a net basis, bad loans were 0.80 percent of the loan book compared with 1.52 percent a year go. This meant that the bank’s loan loss provisioning requirements have come down. For the September quarter, SBI provided Rs 2,011 crore towards bad loans, which was 25 percent less than what it did a year ago. The bank’s slippage ratio and credit costs also declined sharply from year-ago levels. The slippage ratio fell to 0.33 percent for the reported quarter while its credit cost fell 15 basis points to 0.28 percent.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/state-bank-of-india-profit-surges-74-in-september-quarter-9454671.html
SBI,2022-11-04T14:06:39+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"SBI Q2 Preview | Strong loan growth, lower NPA to lift profits","State Bank of India's net interest income will likely show a modest 6 percent growth but lower provisions can push net profit up 39 percent, analysts say ","State Bank of India (SBI), India's biggest lender, is expected to report a robust 39 percent increase in net profit, driven by strong loan growth and improved asset quality, when it announces the numbers for the July-September quarter on November 5.  The quarter-on-quarter growth for most operating metrics is likely to show a big jump, given that State Bank of India reported benign numbers in Q1FY23.  An average of the estimates of eight brokerages polled by Moneycontrol puts SBI’s net profit for Q2FY23 at Rs 10,616.2 crore.  That said, analysts expect net interest income to be Rs 33,200 crore, a modest increase of 6 percent year on year. That, along with a likely fall in non-interest income (NII) could keep operating profit growth at 11 percent to Rs 20,085 crore for the reporting quarter.  SBI’s core interest income growth has been under pressure for many quarters now owing to legacy bad loans that do not contribute to interest income. The low-interest rate regime following the coronavirus outbreak has also been a drag on income.  Yet another factor for lower NII growth has been faster growth in retail loans than corporate loans. Corporate loan growth has recovered but it still is far from pre-pandemic levels. Loans to companies fetch higher interest rates than retail. As such, loan growth is expected to be robust for the September quarter.    Analysts expect SBI to report a healthy 16-18 percent loan growth for the quarter led by sustained retail loan growth and recovery in corporate loan disbursals.  “Healthy growth, margin recovery and lower staff cost in the absence of impact of family pension would drive up profitability,” analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd wrote in a note.  The bank’s loan book expanded 15 percent in the June quarter, led by an 18 percent jump in retail loans.  Asset quality improvement  Most analysts expect SBI to show steady bad loan ratios. Slippages are expected to be under control for the September quarter. This would mean provision requirements could continue to be low .  Analysts at Elara Capital, however, note that small business loans have been a pain point and could contribute to slippages. For the three months ended June, SBI had reported slippages of Rs 9,740 crore and gross bad loans had formed 3.91 percent of the total loan book.  Analysts expect gross bad loans to remain around these levels for the September quarter as well. Recoveries and upgrades will also be watched and the performance of the restructured portfolio of about Rs 30,000 crore would be keenly monitored.  Margin mantra  SBI’s cost of funds is one of the lowest in the industry owing to the bank’s unparalleled access to low-cost deposits. Its current and savings account deposits have a large share of 46 percent of total deposits. CASA growth, however, has been benign and the bank has hiked term deposit rates too.  Analysts expect the net interest margin to be stable above 3 percent for the bank given the deposit heft. But the yield on advances may disappoint and put pressure on margins.  Nevertheless, the outlook remains positive for margins and management commentary on the same would be closely watched. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services expect the margin to improve to 3.1 percent for the September quarter.  At 2.03 pm, the share was trading ing at Rs 588.10 on the NSE, up 0.55 percent.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/sbi-q2-preview-strong-loan-growth-lower-npa-to-lift-profits-9449681.html

But soon the markets turned volatile with the Russian invasion of Ukraine later in that month.","State Bank of India chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said the planned share sale of the bank's mutual fund subsidiary has been shelved for the time being.  SBI Mutual Fund, the country's largest asset manager with around Rs 6.5 lakh crore in asset under management, had in February selected seven merchant bankers for a USD 1-billion IPO. But soon the markets turned volatile with the Russian invasion of Ukraine later in that month.  &quot;There is no plan to list SBI Mutual Fund for now,&quot; Khara told reporters on the sidelines of the national banking summit here. Without citing any reason, he said the IPO plan stands shelved for now.  On December 15, 2021, SBI had announced its plan to offload a 6 per cent stake in SBI MF through an IPO and was planning to raise around USD 1 billion.  SBI holds a 62.6 per cent stake in SBI Mutual Fund, while the remaining 36.8 per cent is with the leading French insurer Amundi Asset Management which was planning to offload 4 per cent of its holding.  Initially Amundi's holding was held by Societe Generale Asset Management, a subsidiary of Societe Generale of France which was transferred to Amundi in June 2011.  SBI had reportedly selected seven i-bankers -- BofA Securities, Citi, HSBC Securities, Axis Capital, Kotak Capital, SBI Caps and BNP Paribas -- for the share sale.  SBI has two other publicly traded subsidiaries -- SBI Life and SBI Card -- and has three more which can be monetised -- the mutual fund arm, general insurance vertical and the investment banking arm, SBI Caps.  SBI Life was listed in 2017. In a Rs 8,400-crore share sale, the IPO was oversubscribed 3.58 times. SBI Card was listed in March 2020 just before the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in a Rs 10,354-crore public issue.  If listed, SBI MF or SBI Funds Management, would have been the fifth listed fund manager after HDFC AMC, UTI Asset Management Company, Nippon Life India AMC and Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC.  Meanwhile, the SBI chairman said credit demand, which has hit an eight-year high of 18 per cent last week, is coming in from across sectors, including SME corporates, retail and agriculture and that credit growth is a clear reflection that the economy is on a rebound.  &quot;There is a healthy demand in the housing sector despite rising rates. Higher rates have not deterred demand,&quot; Khare said, adding, he expects credit growth to be moderate going forward but will remain healthy overall to about 15-16 per cent after festive pickup normalises.  On the digital rupee launch by the RBI on Tuesday, he said the CBDC pilot has gone well on the first day. He also said he doesn't think that bank deposits will be impacted with a full-scale launch of CBDC, which may happen over the next year.  He further said there is no concern on the restructured book as it is behaving better than expected. The NARCL or the national bad bank, is now quite active. &quot;We will see good traction on that front going forward,&quot; he said, adding, banks are exploring all possible options for resolution of bad loans including the NARCL route.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-mutual-funds-ipo-plan-shelved-for-now-says-sbi-chairman-dinesh-kumar-khara-9440191.html
SBI,2022-10-31T15:46:50+05:30,Siddhi Nayak,"Rate war to mop up deposits may hurt banks’ margins, say experts","Net Interest Margin — the amount of money that a bank earns in interest on loans compared to the amount it pays in interest on deposits — is an indicator of profitability and growth. If deposit rates outpace lending rates, then bank NIMs will shrink","The aggressive drive for deposits in the backdrop of tight liquidity conditions may have an adverse effect on bank margins next fiscal year, say experts.  Banks have been aggressively accumulating deposits by offering higher, lucrative interest rates to depositors following four consecutive repo rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  The central bank is fighting a tough battle to contain persistently high retail inflation, which is hitting common households hard.  The impact of aggressive deposit mobilisation is likely to weigh on banks’ net interest margins (NIM) in the coming quarters, banking experts and analysts told Moneycontrol on October 31. In banking parlance, NIM refers to the amount of money that a bank earns in interest on loans compared to the amount it pays in interest on deposits. It is an indicator of a bank's profitability and growth.  “There are expectations of a rate hike in the next monetary policy, which will still allow banks to pass on the incremental cost to advances linked to the benchmark, and deposit rates will continue to rise with a lag, protecting the NIM for FY23,” said Aditya Acharekar, associate director at CareEdge.  “However, some impact on margins may be seen in the first half of FY24,” he added.  Also read: In search of deposits, bankers embark on door-to-door campaign  Rate transmission and NIM  Rate cues from the RBI are transmitted to the economy when lenders adjust their lending and deposit rates based on the RBI's rate actions. For instance, if the RBI hikes the repo rate, then banks will have to borrow short-term funds at a higher cost from the central bank. Banks are also expected to pass on the benefit to borrowers by offering high-interest rates.  Often, monetary transmission happens based on the prevailing liquidity situation. Typically, banks are quick to pass on rate hikes to consumers through loans, but a pass-through to deposits comes with a lag. For much of FY23, banks took advantage of this scenario, which helped them sustain or improve their NIM.  “We are prepared to take a hit on NIMs next fiscal year, but that is an obvious situation given that we have to fund the credit growth through deposits,” said a banker with a private bank on the condition of anonymity. “Mobilising deposits looks like the way forward.”  According to Arun Malhotra, founding partner and portfolio manager of CapGrow Capital Advisors, banks will have to forego NIMs as they could be compressed in the range of 20-25 bps in the short to medium term. Banks, according to Malhotra, may need to increase spreads on fresh repo-linked loans in the next two to four quarters.  In the July-September quarter, HDFC Bank’s core NIM was at 4.1 percent on total assets, and 4.3 percent based on interest-earning assets. Axis Bank’s NIM was at 3.96 percent, while Kotak Mahindra Bank’s NIM stood at 5.17 percent in the reporting quarter. Relatively smaller peers IndusInd Bank and IDBI Bank reported NIMs of 4.24 percent and 4.37 percent, respectively.  The rate picture   State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, recently made an upward revision in retail term deposit interest rates on amounts below Rs 2 crore, by up to 80 basis points. One bps equals one-hundredth of a percentage point. Indeed, most banks have increased their FD rates following the RBI’s 190 bps repo rate hike in the current cycle to rein in inflation.    According to bankers and experts, the ‘war’ for deposits is likely to continue as the RBI hikes rates further and as credit growth continues to expand. This could happen via aggressive deposit mobilisation in the coming months, said bankers. Analysts and economists expect the RBI to increase the repo rate to 6.50 percent by March from 5.90 percent currently.  Sumant Kathpalia, managing director and chief executive officer of IndusInd Bank, said that the lender would continue with its strategy to granularise deposits. The bank’s liabilities will be priced 50-to-75 bps higher than the market, he said at a conference call after the July-September earnings.  On average, banks have raised interest rates in the range of 25-80 bps across tenors. Fixed deposit rates of top banks in the three-year to five-year tenor for amounts below Rs 1 crore currently stand between 5.65 percent and 6.75 percent.  “It is natural for banks to be aggressive as liquidity remains constrained and credit growth is way ahead of deposit growth,” said Hemali Dhame, associate vice-president, of research, at Kotak Securities. “Many banks have been aggressive already, and some have reached a point where a further increase in rates will cause a passthrough in borrower rates.”  Rush for deposits  The primary reason for the rush for deposits is the tightening liquidity in the banking system due to heavy currency leakage and heightened spending on account of the festive season. The RBI’s dollar sales in the foreign exchange market to prevent the rupee’s depreciation have also tightened liquidity.  The mismatch between credit growth and deposit growth has forced most banks to offer high rates on deposits and increase promotional activities for the same.  “If we look at the July-September banking results for FY23, one consistent finding is that advances are growing faster than deposits,” said Punit Patni, a research analyst at Swastika Investment.  “As a result, we anticipate banks raising their deposit rates in order to maintain CASA (current account savings account) deposits or raise money through term deposits. Additionally, due to the dearth of liquidity and good credit growth demand, all the banks are expected to be aggressive in mobilising deposits.”  This trend is likely to continue as credit growth continues to expand, interest rate hikes become more entrenched and liquidity in the system dries up further.  “We are expecting inflationary pressures to persist, and so rates may keep climbing till the end of this financial year,” said Adhil Shetty, chief executive officer at BankBazaar.com. “We may see small banks offer 8 percent or more (FD rates) during this period. If inflation persists, large banks will follow the trend.”  Analysts and industry experts said that the impact of the deposit rate hikes will also depend on the bank's liability and asset profile. Banks having granular, retail-based liability and floating advances are better placed and will witness a minimal impact on their NIMs, they said.  Jindal Haria, a director at India Ratings and Research, said that most banks would have to continue to increase deposit rates till they are confident deposit growth will mirror loan growth. NIMs, however, could expand some more before deposit pricing catches up fully, he said.  Fund-raising to continue  Apart from mobilising deposits, experts also expect banks to tap the market for funds to meet credit demand.  “Banks will have to raise funds from the capital markets through infra bonds, sub-debt and perpetual bonds quickly for long-term funding requirements to augment credit growth as CDs (certificates of deposit) and FDs may not match their long-term funding requirements,” said Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner at Rockfort Fincap, a Mumbai-based debt advisory firm.  Further, banks that are not able to get sufficient funds through FDs and CDs due to tight liquidity conditions will have to continuously increase rates to compete with their peers, added Srinivasan.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rate-war-to-mop-up-deposits-may-hurt-banks-margins-say-experts-9419661.html

I'm not particularly very excited on that front.”  “2024 is an election year. Till then, only a few pending cases may get resolved.

Also read: How much will RBI’s new 50-bps rate hike pinch you as a borrower?  Tapping demand  The drop in rates comes at a time when the RBI’s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has increased the repo rate by 190 basis points since May to quell inflationary pressures in the economy. Banks are quick to pass the repo rate hike on loans to consumers.  Bankers said that the cut in home loan rates comes at the right time, now that the economy is just about recovering from COVID-19 and the festive cheer has begun to set in.  “As we enter the festive season after a long period of muted celebrations due to COVID restrictions, our offers this festive season are aimed at providing the much-needed support to prospective home buyers as they embark on their journey for home ownership,” said Alok Kumar Choudhary, managing director, retail banking and operations at SBI.  Choudhary added that SBI is seeing “strong interest” for home loans across the country.  Home loans extended by banks increased by 16.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 17.86 lakh crore in August, according to data from the central bank. Analysts attributed this rise to pent-up demand, consumers’ growing disposable incomes and aspiration for owning a house.  “Lower interest rates do lure borrowers. We would like to see the length of time the scheme works to see if the demand will accrue,” said Hemali Dhame, associate vice president, research, at Kotak Securities.

According to analysts, demand for loans responds more to every consumer’s affordability rather than cost of money. Also, to say that home loan demand will sustain just on the basis of these cuts would be premature, especially since interest rates are poised to edge higher, going forward, they said. Whether other banks shall follow suit is a strategic decision of each bank, they added.  “In an increasing interest-rate environment, lenders will not offer such generous pricing to everyone. So, the eligibility filters will be fairly tight, I suspect,” said Krishnan ASV, senior vice president, HDFC Securities.  “Any positive impact on demand would be negligible. This demand would come from those consumers who have waited on the sidelines for the right offer. Now, when pricing is conducive, such customers may bite,” Krishnan added.  According to Punit Patni, a research analyst at Swastika Investmart, the robust demand for home ownership is “astonishing”, considering the current interest hikes and rising real estate prices. Lower rates may not be sustainable (for lenders) for a long time, which is why these offers are meant for only a temporary period, added Patni.  Patni said that the recently announced rate cuts by a few lenders “will be the icing on the cake” for borrowers and other banks will jump on the bandwagon soon.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/festive-fervour-hdfc-sbi-bank-of-maharashtra-cut-home-loan-rates-9349071.html

Ltd, Power Finance Corp., Small Industries Development Bank of India, and HDFC Bank were among the top five issuers in September, together raising Rs 31,708 crore","Fund raising through corporate bond sales rose sharply by 49% month-on-month to Rs 82,378 crore on the back of large issuance by some banks and state-owned entities even as the rates on these instrument rise, dealers said.  This was because most issuers have raised funds before yields started to move up, said Umesh Kumar Tulsyan, managing director of Sovereign Global Markets, a New Delhi-based fund house.  Corporate bonds are debt securities issued by private and public corporations. Companies issue corporate bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes, whether  building a new plant, purchasing equipment, or growing their business. When one buys a corporate bond, one effectively lends money to the &quot;issuer,&quot; the company that issued the bond.  According to data from Prime Database, companies and banks raised funds worth Rs 82,378 crore in September, compared to Rs 55,500 crore raised in the previous month. Data also showed that funds raised in September was the highest in the current financial year.

The money raised by these five entities amounted to 39% of the total funds raised in September.  &quot;The view of the market was that the yield will be moving up and all wanted to fulfil their capital requirement, so somehow they timed the best of the market to raise funds,&quot; Tulsyan added.  &quot;Issuance has risen in September because bond yields were supported due to expectation of global bond index inclusion, positive FPI (foreign portfolio investment) flows, lower SDL (State Development loans) supply and strong investors demand which reflected in primary issuance bidding. Also credit off-take has been positive, clocking around 16% Y-o-Y growth and with the festive season approaching we may see a significant rise in demand for money,&quot; said Sanjay Pawar, Fund Manager – Fixed Income, LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Ltd.  Also read: Issuance of commercial paper, certificates of deposits down in September on elevated borrowing costs  Yield movement   Yield on corporate bonds maturing in three years rose by 45 basis points, five years by 40 basis points and 10-year by 22 basis points month-on-month in September, tracking an uptick in government securities yield and low demand from mutual funds. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.  Pawar added that the market had seen a hardening of yields across the segment both in government securities and corporate bonds due to a delay in the inclusion of the country's bonds in its global index, the central bank hiking rates aggressively, a rally in crude prices, weakening rupee and draining out of liquidity from system.  Further, the yield on benchmark government bonds has risen by 25 basis points, whereas due to the quarter-end there was redemption pressure on mutual funds that led to a rise in yields on corporate bonds.  According to data compiled from the corporate bond deals, the yield on three-years corporate bonds that were trading at a 7.10% rose to 7.55% in September, yield on five-years paper rose to 7.65% from 7.20%, and the yield 10-year paper rose to 7.72% from 7.50%.    Going forward   Debt dealers said yields are expected to rise further due to heavy supply in the second half of the current financial year and expectations of further rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  While issuers will keenly watch the movement of the yield on government securities, which were expected to rise further given higher crude oil prices.  Usually, higher Brent crude oil prices put pressure on the inflation print, leading to a dampening of investor sentiments .  In the last few days, Brent crude oil prices had risen sharply after OPEC and its allies decided to cut production output by 2 million barrels per day. Brent crude oil prices were trading at $97.38.  Moreover, the spread between corporate bonds and government securities, which is hovering at a historical low, is expected to rise as supply may increases and if liquidity conditions tighten further, Pawar said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/corporate-bond-issuance-rises-49-on-month-in-september-to-rs-82378-crore-9304801.html

Deposit growth has also been strong","Banks’ provisional business updates for the July-September quarter suggest that loan and deposit growth continues to be robust.  Banking analysts and industry experts said the trend is likely to continue even in the upcoming quarters, despite worsening global macro headwinds and the central bank’s tightening monetary policy regime.  “Over the medium term, a well-capitalised balance sheet, improving loan growth and lower credit cost forecast are positive catalysts that should allow valuation multiples to improve as macro stability returns,” said Nilanjan Karfa, an analyst at brokerage house Nomura.  In this context, three narratives—banks’ current account savings account (CASA)-dominant compounding franchises, earnings geared to growth, and lower credit cost—will likely play out, said Karfa.  Also read: Bank lending rates set to rise further on expected RBI tightening, say experts  Numbers game  Banks’ July-September business updates paint a rosy picture for the sector. Top banks, including State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank, have reported a double-digit increase in loan growth for the July-September quarter on a year-on-year basis. Deposit growth has also been strong.  HDFC Bank, for instance, reported a 23.5 percent increase in loans and advances year on year in the July-September quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, loan growth increased by just over 6 percent. The deposit base grew 19.5 percent on-year.  IndusInd Bank, too, said its advances rose 17.6 percent and 4.7 percent on a yearly and quarterly basis, respectively. Deposits grew at 13.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.  State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, said its advances stood at Rs 67,981 crore in the fiscal second quarter, up 16.6 percent on a year-on-year basis and just over 5 percent on a quarterly basis. Deposits were at Rs 88,503 crore, up 1.9 percent year on year.  Relatively smaller peers Federal Bank, Bank of Maharashtra and Karur Vysya Bank reported a similar trend as seen in the chart below.    Not just banks, mortgage lender HDFC was also party to the trend. HDFC’s assigned loans stood at Rs 9,145 crore in the July-September quarter, up 28.2 percent on a year-on-year basis. Individual loans sold were at Rs 34,513 crore, up about 27 percent on a year-on-year basis.  What’s driving loan growth?  Indian banks are recovering from the COVID-19 crisis, which rendered many Indians jobless. Now that the economy is recovering, credit offtake has improved significantly. According to RBI data, bank credit registered a yearly growth of 16 percent in August. Also, the July-September quarter numbers come on the back of a low base.  Now that the festive season is around the corner, analysts expect banks to capitalise on higher spending and report healthy credit growth in the upcoming quarters as well.  “We expect strong (credit) growth for banks. System credit is at 16 percent, this is likely to translate into strong growth for banks,” said Hemali Dhame, associate vice president–research, at Kotak Securities. “There has been better credit utilisation driven by MSMEs, strong personal loan growth, credit cards and housing.”  “We expect festive season credit growth to be healthy, too. We expect healthy credit growth trends for the year,” added Dhame.  According to Punit Patni, an analyst at Swastika Investmart, a rise in spending, the opening up of the economy as the coronavirus pandemic eases, strong housing and real estate demand, government spending, the thrust on infrastructure, and high capacity utilisation levels are some of the reasons that explain the improved credit growth.  “Following the normalisation of COVID effects, the banking sector is experiencing positive growth momentum, which is expected to last for the next few quarters,” added Patni. “The impending festival season will be the icing on the cake as retail spending and credit demand remain strong.”  Credit demand is expected to stay robust despite four successive rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said analysts. The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has increased rates by 190 basis points since May to quell inflationary pressure . Rate cues from the RBI are transmitted in the banking system when lenders adjust their lending and deposit rates.  Moneycontrol reported on October 3 that even though lending rates are edging higher, bankers and analysts do not expect the rate hike cycle to curb demand for loans.  Also read: Banks’ loan book to grow 14-15% YoY in FY23; GNPAs seen at 5% by March end, analysts say  Deposit mobilisation to continue  To fund the credit growth, analysts expect banks to mobilise deposits, especially in the wake of banking surplus liquidity tightening at a faster pace.  Already, lenders such as Axis Bank, DCB Bank, ICICI Bank and RBL Bank have increased fixed deposit (FD) rates following the RBI rate hike. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, in his post-policy briefing, said there would be more traction with regard to the adjustment of deposit rates, going forward.  “We expect a rate war sort of situation to mobilise deposits, especially in the mid- and small-sized banking segment,” said Swastika Investmart’s Patni. “However, banks with high CASA share, high liquidity coverage, and low credit-to-deposit ratios are better positioned to navigate the upcoming liquidity dearth.”  Kotak Securities’ Dhame concurred with Patni. “Deposit mobilisation is likely to be the way forward,” she said. Banks have raised deposit rates since the rate hike cycle has begun but not commensurate with the hikes in repo.

This provides a major relief to the promoters of the Rs 5,000-crore Kamineni group with interests in manufacturing, healthcare and medical education as they gain back management control over the company that was being managed by the Tribunal-appointed insolvency resolution professional for over two years.  The OCTL managing director Sashidhar Kamineni told Moneycontrol that the promoters have successfully struck a compromise deal of one-time settlement (OTS) with all the lenders who have now agreed to withdraw the CIRP proceedings against the company.  Following this, the Hyderabad bench of the NCLT on September 21 ordered the withdrawal of CIRP proceedings against Oil Country, while relieving the insolvency resolution professional from his duties.  The resolution professional took control and custody of the management and operations of Oil Country on January 28, 2020, the day the NCLT had ordered initiating CIRP proceedings at the company after admitting the petition filed by the financial creditors led by SBI.  The Tribunal in its September 21 directives recalling the CIRP proceedings has noted that the corporate debtor (OCTL) has settled the dues of the financial creditors under OTS following which the creditors passed a resolution with 100 percent voting to withdraw the CIRP proceedings. “Hence, the Corporate Debtor (OCTL) is at liberty to function through the Directors as per law.”  Though Indian Bank and Indian Overseas Bank have been in favour of the OTS proposal and withdrew the CIRP proceedings against OCTL, it was SBI that changed its stand after initially accepting the proposal in the joint lenders’ meeting.  As the compromise proposal has to be effectuated within 90 days from the date of commencement of the CIRP process, Oil Country had instituted the payment of the accepted OTS and even paid Rs 60.54 crore out of Rs 70 crore. However, SBI, though agreed to OTS initially, refused to accept the amounts and extend the time for balance payments.  Earlier on July 15, Justice B Vijaysen Reddy of the Telangana High Court ordered setting aside the decision of the SBI where the lender refused to accept the previously approved OTS proposal and to extend the time for payments. The court directed the lenders to look afresh into the OTS proposal approved earlier for payment of amounts beyond the stipulated time along with interest.  The Telangana High Court also found the stand of SBI as lacking transparency and clarity and the bank’s action in refusing to accept the OTS as “arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.”  Following this, the Committee of Creditors (CoC) at their meeting held on September 17 approved with 100 percent voting to accept the OTS proposal and conveyed to the NCLT their decision to withdraw the CIRP proceedings against Oil Country Tubular.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-withdraws-cirp-proceedings-against-oil-country-after-over-two-years-9233881.html

Agarwal, along with ABG Shipyard and others, was booked by the central agency in February this year for allegedly cheating a consortium of banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) of over Rs 22,842 crore.  Besides Agarwal, the agency had also named ABG Shipyard's then executive director Santhanam Muthaswamy, directors Ashwini Kumar, Sushil Kumar Agarwal and Ravi Vimal Nevetia and another company ABG International Pvt Ltd for alleged offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating, criminal breach of trust and abuse of official position under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Prevention of Corruption Act.  This is reported to be the biggest bank fraud case registered by the CBI.  Notably, the SBI had first filed a complaint on November 8, 2019, on which the CBI had sought some clarifications on March 12, 2020. The bank filed a fresh complaint in August that year. After scrutinising, the CBI acted on the complaint and filed an FIR on February 7, 2022.  The company was sanctioned credit facilities from 28 banks and financial institutions with the SBI having exposure of Rs 2,468.51 crore, the agency officials had told news agency PTI.  The Forensic Audit has shown that between 2012-17, the accused colluded together and committed illegal activities including diversion of funds, misappropriation and criminal breach of trust, the officials had reportedly said.  The loan account was declared a non-performing asset (NPA) in July 2016 and a fraud in 2019.  The alleged delay in the registration of FIR by the CBI had drawn criticism from the Opposition. The Congress, the country's prime Opposition party, had questioned the Centre in February on why it took five years after the liquidation proceedings of ABG Shipyard to lodge a case in connection with the alleged duping of 28 banks.  &quot;Why did the Modi government refuse to take note of the allegations made on February 15, 2018 by the Congress, warning of a scam in ABG Shipyard, and why no FIR was lodged and criminal action taken despite their accounts having been declared as fraud on June 19, 2019?&quot; the party had asked.

SBI,2022-09-16T17:46:13+05:30,Moneycontrol News,MC Explains | What is banks’ business correspondent network?,"To put it simply, BCs are agents who connect banks with customers.","India’s banking sector is witnessing the fastest pace of credit growth in nearly a decade, and business correspondents (BCs) are a part of the core process of credit delivery to remote and unbanked areas.  Moneycontrol on September 16 reported first that the BC partner of country’s largest lender SBI, Save Solutions, is eyeing an initial public offering (IPO) in FY25.  Through this explainer, Moneycontrol will walk you through BCs - what are they and why they are critical to India’s banking infrastructure:  Who are BCs?  To put it simply, BCs are agents who connect banks with customers.  BC touch points allow bank customers to undertake critical banking transactions including withdrawal of cash and money transfer, among others.  Why are they important?  As per the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) FY22 annual report, the total number of business correspondents in villages has increased from more than 11.9 lakh in 2020 to 18.44 lakh in 2021, reflecting the penetration and scale that banks generate partnering with BCs.  Urban locations covered by banks through the BC channels also rose to 14.12 lakh in 2021 from 3.24 lakh in 2020, as per RBI data. The sharp increase was on account of higher amount of data provided by “a few” private banks, the RBI said.  The total number of bank BCs in villages during 2010 stood at 34,174, while banks in urban areas reported having 447 BCs during the same period. The data highlights how significantly banks have been using the BC network to reach masses.    Who are the top players?  As per the Indian Banks’ Association website, there are 285 corporate BCs in India including Fino Payments Bank, Save Solutions, Airtel Payments Bank, among others.  Individually, SBI has the highest number of BC partners, at 71,968 across country.  What is the business model?  In exchange for providing banks’ various services to its customers, BCs charge a pre-determined minimum fee per transaction to the bank.  Will BC model and infrastructure keep pace with digital adoption?  As per Save Solutions MD Ajeet Kumar Singh, digitisation does not pose any threat to the BC model.  “Even though digital transactions are increasing, digital platforms have more presence and are used more in urban areas but 95 percent CSPs (customer service points) are in rural areas,” Singh said.  “The rural area users are not very friendly with digital payment methods. They all are more into cash payments and transactions,” he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/mc-explains-what-is-banks-business-correspondent-network-9190331.html
SBI,2022-09-16T15:10:46+05:30,Piyush Shukla,Exclusive | SBI’s largest BC partner SAVE Solutions eyes IPO in FY25,"Save Solutions MD &amp; CEO said the company was also open to acquiring broking agencies and other NBFCs, depending on valuation.","SAVE Solutions, the largest business correspondent (BC) partner of State Bank of India (SBI), plans to go public in fiscal 2025, its top official said.  “We are planning to launch an IPO (initial public offering) in the 2024-25 financial year which will totally depend on the situation of the market sentiments,” the company’s managing director and chief executive officer (MD &amp;amp; CEO) Ajeet Kumar Singh told Moneycontrol on Friday, September 16.  Business correspondents act as a last-mile touchpoint for banks that are unable to set up branches in remote areas. These touchpoints allow bank customers to undertake various banking transactions including withdrawal of cash and money transfer.  In exchange for providing banks’ services to its customers, BCs charge a predetermined minimum fee per transaction to the respective lender.  SAVE solutions, based out of Gaya, Bihar, started operations in 2009. In FY21, SAVE Solutions’ BC business clocked in a total transaction value of Rs 41,000 crore, Singh said. According to him, for SBI, SAVE Solutions undertakes about 500,000-600,000 transactions per day amounting to nearly Rs 200 crore.  Per the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) website, there are a total of 285 registered corporate BCs in India.  Further, the firm also plans to go for another round of equity capital raising from institutional investors, Singh said.  “We are also planning to raise the third round of equity and we have already started the process. Microfinance portfolios will definitely grow very fast… Other portfolios will also grow as per the business plans. So this is a good trend,” Singh added.  As per Singh, SAVE Solutions works with banks including SBI, Bank of India (BOI), Bank of Baroda (BoB) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) as their BC partner, and serves about 4 lakh customers on a daily basis.  “We are the largest business correspondent of the State Bank of India having 9,000 CSPs (customer service points), and are present pan-India. We have a presence of like 1,200 CSPs for BOI. We have 500 CSPs for BoB. We have just started with PNB six months back, so have 300 CSPs for them and are also working with the two RRBs (regional rural banks),” Singh said.  According to Singh, state-run banks now want to use the BC network in not just banking transactions but also to source loans.  “BCs have a wide scope because banks nowadays are looking at BCs in a different way. Banks like SBI have tied up with us for loan sourcing, loan collections, from agriculture to sales and agriproducts and loan products through our CSP network,” Singh said.  When asked whether digitisation of banking services poses a threat to the BC model, Singh said that even though online transactions are increasing, digital platforms have a higher presence and are more widely used in urban areas but 95 percent CSPs are in rural areas.  “The rural area users are not very friendly with digital payment methods. They all are more into cash payments and transactions,” he said.  Singh said that SAVE Solutions was open to acquiring broking agencies and other non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).  “We are looking for both organic and inorganic growth with a primary focus on organic growth. We are open to acquiring broking agencies and other NBFCs, but it totally depends on valuation,” he said.  As of the end of June, SAVE Solutions had a network of over 12,000 CSPs covering 21 million rural customers in 28 states and 3 Union territories, according to a company presentation.  “The IPO will likely see participation based on factors including management, valuation, floor price and scope of expansion, among others. It totally boils down to what is going to be valuation and floor price,” said Gaurang Shah, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/exclusive-sbis-largest-bc-partner-save-solutions-eyes-ipo-in-fy25-9188641.html
SBI,2022-09-15T18:42:46+05:30,Moneycontrol News,SBI not identified as nodal bank for trade with Russia,"SBI says the RBI authorises all banks in India, including SBI, to open special Rupee Vostro account to promote invoicing in rupee","The country's largest public sector lender, State Bank of India (SBI), on September 15 clarified that it has not been identified as the nodal bank for handling Russia-related transactions after news reports suggested so.  Mentioning the July-dated Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular on forming additional arrangement for invoicing, payment, and settlement of exports and imports in rupees amid the Russia-Ukraine war situation, SBI noted that the central bank has authorised all the banks in India, including the SBI, to open Special Rupee Vostro account to promote invoicing in Indian rupee.  &quot;Accordingly, SBI is making necessary arrangements and processing requests received from various banks, including Russian banks, duly following RBI guidelines and our policies and procedures. SBI, as such, has not been identified as a nodal bank,&quot; it clarified.  On July 11, the RBI had announced a mechanism to settle payments for international trade in rupees, especially for India's exports.  The decision, the RBI mentioned, had come in order to promote growth of global trade with emphasis on exports from India and to support the increasing interest of global trading community in Indian rupees. &quot;Before putting in place this mechanism, authorised dealer (AD) banks shall require prior approval from the Foreign Exchange Department of Reserve Bank of India,&quot; the central bank added.  It also mentioned that the exchange rate between the currencies of the two trading partner countries may be market-determined.  Meanwhile, the Indian rupee weakened sharply against a rampant US dollar, driven by a broad-based selloff in global markets. PTI reported that the rupee fell 41 paise to 79.58 against the US dollar in early trade.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/sbi-not-identified-as-nodal-bank-for-trade-with-russia-9184531.html
SBI,2022-09-15T07:20:49+05:30,PTI,SBI raises benchmark lending rate by 0.7%,The announcement would make loan repayment linked to BPLR costlier. The current BPLR rate is 12.75 per cent. It was revised last in June.,"The country's largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), raised the Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR) by 70 basis points (or 0.7 per cent) to 13.45 per cent.  The announcement would make loan repayment linked to BPLR costlier. The current BPLR rate is 12.75 per cent. It was revised last in June.  &quot;Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR) revised as 13.45 per cent per annum with effect from September 15, 2022,&quot; the SBI posted on its website. The bank has also raised the base rate by similar basis points to 8.7 per cent, effective Thursday.  The EMI amount for the borrowers who have taken loans at the base rate would go up. These are the old benchmarks on which banks used to disburse loans. Now most of the banks provide loans on the External Benchmark Based Lending Rate (EBLR) or the Repo-Linked Lending Rate (RLLR).  The bank revises both the BPLR and the base rate on a quarterly basis. The lending rate revision by the SBI is likely to be followed by other banks in the days to come. The increase in the benchmark lending rates comes weeks ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy meeting, which is again expected to hike rates to tame inflation.  According to the schedule, the next three-day monetary policy meeting will be held from September 28 to September 30.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-raises-benchmark-lending-rate-by-0-7-9180611.html
SBI,2022-09-14T19:32:45+05:30,PTI,India has decided to authorise SBI to promote rupee trade with Russia: FIEO president,The RBI in July issued a detailed circular asking banks to put in place additional arrangements for export and import transactions in Indian rupees in view of increasing interest of the global trading community in the domestic currency.,"India has decided to authorise the country's biggest lender SBI to promote rupee trade with Russia and soon Moscow will name its bank to operationalise the mechanism, exporters' body FIEO said on Wednesday. The RBI in July issued a detailed circular asking banks to put in place additional arrangements for export and import transactions in Indian rupees in view of increasing interest of the global trading community in the domestic currency.  Currently, a large part of bilateral trade between India and Russia is getting settled in rupee due to sanctions imposed by the US and Europe following Moscow's attack on Ukraine. The RBI had said for settlement of trade transactions, the concerned banks will require special rupee vostro accounts of correspondent bank/s of the partner trading country.  Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) president A Sakthivel said that the SBI (State Bank of India) is equipped with doing business in rupee with Russia, but Moscow has to identify one bank. &quot;Yesterday commerce secretary (B V R Subrahmanyam) was there with us in the evening. He said that very soon Russian government is going to identify a bank...Rupee trade with Russia will happen,&quot; Sakthivel told reporters here.  He said that Russia is expected to announce the name of the bank in 15 days. &quot;So the SBI is already identified here...We have a good rupee payment mechanism in Iran, so same thing will happen (with Russia)...SBI is a huge bank to cater the need of exporters,&quot; he added.  FIEO has demanded from the government that rupee trade should be entitled for benefits currently available for trade in major currencies. Once the mechanism comes into play, &quot;we do not want to bother about the foreign currency fluctuations. Indian rupee will speak for itself ...I think very soon it will happen,&quot; Sakthivel said.  On September 7, Reserve Bank and the finance ministry asked top management of banks and representatives of trade bodies to push exports and import transactions in rupee. According to sources, it was stressed during a meeting that banks should connect with their foreign counterparts for opening special rupee vastro accounts to facilitate cross-border trade in Indian currency rather than popular mode dollar.  They had stated that countries like Sri Lanka, Argentina and Zimbabwe may be interested in settling bilateral trade in rupee. The announcement by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to allow cross-border trade transactions in rupee is a timely move and a step towards internationalisation of the currency.  In 2021-22, India's exports to Russia stood at USD 3.25 billion, while imports aggregated at about USD 10 billion.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/india-has-decided-to-authorise-sbi-to-promote-rupee-trade-with-russia-fieo-president-9179631.html

Reliance Industries remains India's most-valued company, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, HDFC Bank, Infosys, ICICI Bank and Hindustan Unilever","Shares of State Bank of India on Wednesday became the third lender and seventh Indian company to cross the Rs 5-trillion market cap for the first time after its shares rallied over 22 percent so far this year.  The stock hit a record high of Rs 564.85 on the BSE, up 1.3 percent from its previous close. The stock stayed in the green through five straight sessions and gained 6 percent in this period.  HDFC Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd achieved this milestone earlier. Among other Indian companies, Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Hindustan Unilever, Life Insurance Corp of India and HDFC are in the league.  SBI now ranks seventh most valued Indian company. Reliance Industries remains India's most-valued company, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, HDFC Bank, Infosys, ICICI Bank and Hindustan Unilever.    Since the last few sessions, banking stocks traded higher amid RBI data showing demand for credit in good growth. Bank Nifty rose for the fifth session, gaining 2 percent in this period. Since the start of September, ICICI Bank gained 5 percent, HDFC Bank 3 percent and Axis Bank 7.5 percent.  The RBI data for the week ended August 26 showed the credit growth of Indian banks was at a nine-year high of 15.5 percent on-year. Outstanding credit in the banking system stood at Rs 124.30 trillion at the end of August 26 with banks having lent close to Rs 6 trillion between April and August.  Analysts expect that SBI is a key beneficiary of the systemic uptick in credit demand, especially led by corporate credit growth witnessed so far this year.  &quot;With increasing signs of momentum continuing in corporate demand and a potential capex upturn in FY24, we believe that SBI is one of the best-placed participants in the sector. Though the share of retail loans has gone up over the last few years (36 percent of loans in 1Q23 as against 31 percent in FY20), we see a gradual increase in the corporate credit share incrementally,&quot; said JM Financial in a recent note to investors.  The lender reported unimpressive earnings in the June quarter with many brokerages have either maintained or cut their earnings forecast for FY23 and FY24, citing a miss on the net interest margin (NIM), lowest net interest income (NII) growth in Q1 among top five banks, and likely capital requirement in the medium term.  &quot;(Margins) in our view should normalise going ahead with the bank’s liability franchise being among the best in the sector. While the bank may need to raise equity capital over the next 12-24 months (CET1), stake sale in subsidiaries (SBI Funds, SBI General Insurance) remains another option to augment capital and may delay the eventual dilution,&quot; the JM Financial report said.  According to Bloomberg, SBI has 48 'buy' and two 'hold' ratings. No analysts have a 'sell' rating on the stock.  Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

The bank’s current retail loan growth was “quite sustainable.” More so, loan growth was uniform across retail segments such as personal loans, and auto loans, he said.  On the corporate side, too, SBI’s sanctioned project loans stood at Rs 1.5 lakh crore to Rs 1.7 lakh crore, he said. About 70 to 75 percent of these projects were from the private sector.  The bank was seeing good traction from renewable energy and electric vehicle segments, the chairman added.  SBI’s loan growth stood at 14.9 percent in April-June, up from 11 percent in the previous quarter and 5.8 percent in the same quarter of the last financial year.  Most banks are aiming for a higher credit growth this fiscal as the economy picks up pace and credit growth expands.  Also read: Bankers set eyes on double-digit loan growth in FY23 as credit demand makes comeback  Guidance  Khara said on September 9 that the state-run lender was targeting credit costs to be less than 100 basis points in FY23. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.  As far as net interest margins are concerned, SBI expects a range of 3.15 percent and 3.20 percent to hold. SBI’s NIMs stood at 3.23 percent in the April-June quarter.  The bank had raised Rs 6,800 crore through additional tier 1 bonds, Khara said. It would raise additional funds via tier 2 bonds.  The state-run lender expected 100 bad loan resolutions to happen through the bankruptcy court or the National Company Law Tribunal, the chairman said. So far in FY23, there have been 80 liquidations, he added.  On August 6, SBI reported a net profit of Rs 6,068 crore for the June quarter, missing the Street estimates by a wide margin as treasury losses eroded profitability. Beyond the treasury hit, SBI’s core performance was resilient.  Net interest income, the difference between the interest income the bank earns from its lending activities and the interest paid to depositors, grew by a healthy 12.87 percent to Rs 31,196 crore for the quarter on the back of a robust 14.9 percent loan growth and stable margins.  Provisions toward bad loans declined, as asset quality improved. Provisions declined 15 percent to Rs 4,268 crore for the three months ended June 30, aiding net profit growth.  SBI’s gross bad loans ratio improved from the year-ago period and its already strong provision cushion strengthened further.  The total pile of gross bad loans declined 15 percent from a year ago to Rs 1.13 lakh crore as of June end. Gross bad loans formed 3.91 percent of the loan book as against 5.32 percent in the same quarter of the previous financial year.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-targeting-at-least-15-loan-growth-in-fy23-says-chairman-dinesh-khara-9154191.html
SBI,2022-09-07T14:51:34+05:30,Piyush Shukla,"MC Explains | As Kotak Bank writes to RBI on standard fraud disclosure norms, 7 key questions answered",Private banks reported more frauds than their public sector bank peers in FY22 but the amount involved was lower than that of PSU lenders,"Private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank said on August 30 that it wrote twice to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) requesting enforcement of standardised fraud reporting requirements by all lenders.  This came after a media report, citing government data, said Kotak recorded 5,278 cases of fraud in the first quarter (April to June) of FY22, whereas State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, reported only nine cases.  Moneycontrol spoke to bankers and experts on whether all banks follow set protocols in reporting frauds and the challenges and reforms needed to plug loopholes:  1. What type of frauds do banks report to the regulator?  Lenders must report frauds of Rs 1 lakh and above pertaining to fund misappropriation, criminal breach of trust, encashment through forged instruments, manipulation of books of accounts or through fictitious accounts, and conversion of property, said Jugal Mantri, chief executive officer at Anand Rathi Global Finance, citing RBI guidelines.  Banks must also report frauds related to unauthorised credit facilities extended for reward or for illegal gratification, negligence and cash shortages, cheating and forgery, and irregularities in foreign exchange transactions, among others.  Kotak Mahindra said of the 5,278 cases it reported, 97 percent were associated with digital and card-related frauds that occurred “due to customers unwittingly compromising their credentials by clicking on unknown links” or giving access to their devices, among others.  “It is our submission that other banks do not appear to be exhaustively or uniformly reporting these types of frauds. Such frauds are not a reflection of any vulnerabilities in the bank’s secure infrastructure and systems,” the bank said.  2. How many frauds did banks report in FY22?  Responding to Moneycontrol’s query, an SBI spokesperson said the bank reported 4,192 frauds in FY22 and 5,724 frauds in FY21 to the regulator.  Data provided by the RBI shows that while private lenders reported more frauds than public sector banks in FY22, the total value of frauds reported by PSU banks was substantially higher than that of private banks.  As per the RBI data, private lenders reported 5,334 fraud cases amounting to over Rs 1 lakh during FY22, higher than 3,078 cases reported by the state-run lenders. The total amount involved in frauds reported by private banks stood at Rs 17,588 crore during FY22, lower than Rs 40,282 crore of frauds reported by state-owned lenders.  Further, according to the latest data provided by the Centre, during Q1FY23 while some lenders did not report any fraud, HDFC Bank reported 303 fraud cases while ICICI Bank reported 436 cases. The two banks did not offer comment for this story.  3. Which are the areas where banks report the most frauds?  According to the SBI spokesperson, the most instances of fraud by volume is in the retail segment, and by value, it is in the corporate segment.  Deloitte India, citing a survey, identified retail banking as a major contributor to fraud incidents, with 53 percent of the respondents indicating they had experienced more than 100 fraud incidents over the past two years, reflecting a 29 percent increase since the previous edition.  “Similarly, the non-retail segment saw an average of 20 fraud incidents, highlighted by 56 percent of the survey respondents, again a rise from the previous edition that stood at 22 percent,” said KV Karthik, partner, financial advisory, at Deloitte India.  Additionally, data theft, cybercrime, third-party induced fraud, bribery and corruption, and fraudulent documentation were identified as the top five concerns with over 42 percent of the respondents (cumulative) reporting to be victims of these, as per the Deloitte survey.  “Similarly, in the RBI annual report, while overall frauds reported decreased, ‘loan frauds’ have been highlighted as one major area of concern. This was based on the data provided by the banks for frauds above Rs 1 lakh,” Karthik said.  4. What are the reasons for banks’ failure to report frauds?  Ashvin Parekh, managing partner at Ashvin Parekh Advisory Services, said the key problem lies in recognising fraud, which is done by banks. After studying the frequency and severity of each fraud, the bank’s risk management committee must report each fraud to the board of directors, he said.  Governance plays a key role in the reporting of frauds, Parekh said.  “Frauds can not only cause financial loss but reputation risk to the bank as well. In many banks, for instance, you may find that the disclosure policy itself may be an open one, leaving decisions to executives. If the board is not vigilant and the risk management practices are weak, then frauds which occur may not be taken as seriously as some other banks may take. That is exactly what Kotak Bank is saying,” Parekh said.  Amit Das, cofounder of Think360.ai, said most banks and non-banking finance companies don’t report fraud comprehensively.  “There are challenges associated with tracking and reporting frauds consistently, resolving fraud-related issues, establishing clear accountability, off-system management, potential expose of internal process failures, reputation risk, among others. This is similar to the teething issues with bureau reporting in the earlier years,” Das said.  5. What is the RBI doing to tackle fraud disclosure challenges?  According to  Karthik, the RBI has mandated banks to report all types of frauds. Banks need to furnish Fraud Monitoring Returns in individual fraud cases, irrespective of the amount involved.  The RBI asked banks to submit fraud reports in cases where central investigating agencies have initiated criminal proceedings suo moto and where the RBI has directed that such cases be reported as fraud, Karthik said, adding that the format for reporting of fraud to the RBI has been provided by the regulator in various circulars issued at regular intervals.  As Moneycontrol reported on August 29, the RBI is also working on a fraud registry aimed at keeping repeat offenders at bay from the banking system.  “The fraud registry will capture information like IP (internet protocol) addresses and phone numbers repeatedly used to commit frauds,” executive director Anil Kumar Sharma said on August 29.  “A mechanism for these details would be created so that banks can report these details to us. That will help us prevent these fraudsters using the banking infrastructure for perpetrating fraud after fraud after fraud,” he added.  6. What are banks doing to lower fraudulent transactions?  Public and private sector banks are raising customer awareness on frauds through digital campaigns, bankers said.  Sending messages and mails to customers advising them not to click on any unknown links, asking them not to provide private bank account information to others through calls and messages, and running digital campaigns to raise awareness are some of the measures, they said.  HDFC Bank recently launched a fraud awareness campaign called #StayVigil through which the bank will “educate people about fraud and its prevention techniques” and guide customers who have been defrauded of their savings.  7. Are better regulations needed to report frauds?  Bankers and analysts are divided on whether the RBI should introduce further fraud disclosure norms.  Das of Think360, who is in favour of further regulation, says there is a “big need” to standardise fraud reporting and fraud management norms across lenders. It will ensure consistency, better fraud repositories, deeper understanding of systemic or process failures, and swifter response to fraud events, he said. It will also allow for faster action against perpetrators, he added.  “Imagine a fraudster replicating the same modus operandi across multiple institutions and accounts and getting away with it because they are aware that no one is tracking aggressively,” Das said.  Mantri of Anand Rathi, on the other hand, said the present fraud disclosure norms are adequate and called for lenders to follow the existing procedure vigilantly.  “As per the RBI circular dated Sept. 29, 2016, frauds are classified under seven broad categories. This classification does not specifically include online/digital frauds. There could be a possibility of non-reporting of such instances. Else, I do not see any incentive for non-reporting,” Mantri said.  The RBI guidelines and internal norms of lending institutions are adequate, he said, adding that true compliance with policies, regular reviews and monitoring mechanisms can help in averting fraud.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/mc-explains-as-kotak-bank-writes-to-rbi-on-standard-fraud-disclosure-norms-7-key-questions-answered-9142361.html

SBI,2022-09-05T11:41:03+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"HDFC Bank, SBI plan to raise Rs 10,000 crore through AT-1 bonds this week: Report","Last week, the Bank of Baroda issued AT-1 bonds worth Rs 2,474 crore at a cutoff of 7.88 percent.","Banking giants HDFC Bank and State Bank of India (SBI) plan to collectively raise up to Rs 10,000 crore through sales of perpetual bonds this week, The Economic Times reported on September 5 citing people aware of the development.  The fundraise points to credit demand comeback in the world's fifth largest economy as bankers expect an over 10 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) loan growth in the current fiscal.  Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.  Perpetual, or Additional Tier 1 (AT-1), bonds are a type of perpetual debt instrument that banks use to augment their core equity base and thus comply with Basel III norms. These bonds were introduced by the Basel accord after the global financial crisis to protect depositors. These are relatively risky as investors – mostly institutional players – may lose their entire capital as happened in the case of Yes Bank in 2020.  The majority of these bonds include a call option in the fifth year.  According to the report, SBI plans to raise up to Rs 7,000 crore for which it is in talks with the LIC of India and the Unit Trust of India (UTI). Private insurers have also been approached, the ET report highlighted. The bank intends to offer about 7.70-7.80%.  HDFC Bank is seeking to raise up to Rs 3,000 crore on September 6 when its bonds will be up for bidding on the stock exchange platform, it noted.

SBI,2022-09-02T15:50:04+05:30,Piyush Shukla,"RBI in talks with 4 banks, fintechs for digital currency launch this financial year","The RBI is working on phased implementation of CBDC in both the wholesale and retail segments, RBI ED Ajay Kumar Choudhary said in July.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is holding consultations with a clutch of fintech companies and is said to have asked four public sector banks to run a pilot Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project ahead of a possible rollout this financial year.  The list of fintechs  that the RBI is consulting include US-based FIS which has been holding roundtable conferences and workshops with central bankers globally on CBDCs.  The fintech company is advising central banks on CBDC topics such as offline payments, programmable payments, new monetary policy toolkit, interest-bearing CBDC, fractional banking issues, financial inclusion, and cross-border CBDC payments, Demidova said.  “FIS has had various engagements with the RBI...and, of course, our connected ecosystem could be extended to the RBI to experiment various CBDC options,” Julia Demidova, senior director at FIS, told Moneycontrol on September 2.  “Whether it is a wholesale or retail CBDC transaction, our technology can also be extended to commercial banks where they can test and tokenise central bank money in the form of digital regulated money,” Demidova added.  Legal status  CBDC is a currency that is backed by the regulator and stored in a digital format. It can be converted into paper currency and will reflect on the RBI’s balance sheet, thereby granting it legal tender status.  The RBI could use blockchain technology to develop its CBDC, with adequate regulations, experts said.  Additionally, the RBI has roped in four state-run banks to run a pilot CBDC project, according to two bank officials.  “The RBI has asked State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India and Bank of Baroda to run the pilot internally,” the official said, requesting anonymity.  Queries sent by Moneycontrol to the RBI, SBI, BoB and Union Bank for comments on the pilot CBDC project did not elicit a response by the time of publishing.  Another senior PSU bank official, however, confirmed the matter.  “There is a pilot on CBDCs. The RBI may come with the launch this year. When it will exactly roll out the product and specifications is to be seen,” the banker said.  According to Vikram Babbar, a partner and lead of financial services at EY, products like the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) gained momentum and have paved the way for the digital currency.  While cryptocurrencies have been in use for some time globally, the risks associated with their usage, including anonymity and the lack of a central agency backing, have been at the forefront and have attracted more frauds and financial crime incidents recently, he said.  To mitigate some of the risks, central banks and regulators like the RBI have planned to launch a fiat digital currency, he added.  “From an Indian standpoint, CBDC would further support financial inclusion and at the same time ensure that the risk of fraud and money laundering is minimised. This would additionally entail setting up the right infrastructure and monitoring mechanisms before the formal launch. For a country like India, testing with a pilot launch and planning a phased implementation may be an apt start,” Babbar said.  Act amended  On July 20, Ajay Kumar Choudhary, executive director at RBI, said that with the announcement of the CBDC launch in the Union Budget, the RBI Act of 1934 had been amended to enable the RBI to conduct the pilot project and subsequently issue the CBDC.  “The RBI is also working on phased implementation of a CBDC in both the wholesale and retail segments,” he added.  The ED’s comments are in line with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s statement on March 8, when she was quoted by PTI as saying, “It was a conscious call taken in consultation with the central bank – the Reserve Bank of India.... we would like them to design it the way they would like to do it, but this year we expect the currency to come out from the central bank itself.”  The finance minister had also said there are “clear advantages in a central bank driven digital currency because in this day and age, bulk payments happening between countries, large transactions between institutions and large transactions between central banks themselves of each country are all better enabled with digital currency.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/rbi-in-talks-with-banks-fintech-for-digital-currency-rollout-in-fy23-9121831.html
SBI,2022-09-01T20:37:44+05:30,PTI,SBI slashes FY23 growth forecast to 6.8% on way-below Q1 numbers,"The Q1 growth numbers, which showed a consensus growth of 13.5 percent, pulled down by the poor show of the manufacturing sector, negated the robust show by the services sector.","Chief economist at State Bank of India has revised downward the full-year growth forecast to a low 6.8 per cent from 7.5 per cent earlier for FY2023, citing &quot;the way below GDP numbers for the first quarter&quot;.  The National Statistical Office on Wednesday released the Q1 growth numbers which showed a consensus growth of 13.5 per cent, pulled down by the poor show of the manufacturing sector, which reported a paltry 4.8 per cent expansion in the first three months of FY23, negating the robust show by the services sector.  Consensus forecast was 15-16.7 per cent of which the RBI made the highest forecast of 16.7 per cent. SBI group chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh had also forecast a 15.7 per cent growth for the first quarter.  The economy from the gross value added (GVA) also fared much lower than forecast, logging in only 12.7 per cent. At 13.5 per cent, real GDP growth has declined by 9.6 per cent sequentially, but the seasonally adjusted real GDP growth series shows pick-up in economic momentum, with higher growth at 5.6 per cent sequentially in Q1 compared to -4.1 per cent in Q1FY22 and 1.9 percent in Q4FY22, Ghosh, said in a note on Thursday.  The headline GDP numbers hide more things than these reveal and it's time to seriously introspect on the measurement of IIP and CPI baskets which were last revised in 2012, he said. Though the GDP grew in double-digits but still it came way below the market expectations and the primary culprit is growth in manufacturing sector which grew by a measly 4.8 per cent in Q1, Ghosh said, and pencilled in sharply lower fully year growth at 6.8 per cent.  Giving a break-up of the rest of the quarters, he expects Q2 to print in at 6.9 per cent, Q3 at 4.1 per cent and the final quarter to log in a low 4 per cent taking the full year number to be 6.8 per cent. &quot;We are now revising our annual GDP growth for FY23 to 6.8 per cent, mostly due to a statistical adjustments, but said growth momentum likely to show an increasing momentum in second half,&quot; Ghosh said.  He had earlier projected Q1 growth of 15.7 percent. What is more disappointing is that nominal GDP growth came in 26.7 per cent from 32.4 per cent in Q1 FY22 and 14.9 per cent in Q4FY22, led by private final consumption expenditure increasing in overall growth.  Private final consumption expenditure in real terms improved to 10 per cent, which is above the pre-pandemic level. The gap between nominal GDP growth and real GDP growth has increased between Q2FY20 and Q1FY22 owing to higher inflation. It moderated in Q2 and Q3FY22 but increased again in the last two quarters.  The growth in deflator has increased modestly to 11.6 percent in Q1FY23 from 10.4 percent in Q4FY22. Growth in GDP deflator for agriculture has increased further to 12.4 percent compared to 10.7 percent in Q4FY22, indicating the persistent impact of higher food prices, while industry growth deflator has increased mainly on account of mining and quarrying and electricity, gas, water supply &amp;amp; other utility services; and the services deflator has declined only in case of public administration, defence and other services.  He said there is a serious need for reestimating manufacturing sector growth needs in the sense that IIP is still indexed at 2012 base. The CPI basket has also not changed since 2012 and this has also possibly resulted in overstating CPI inflation at multiple times. Citing the example of manufacturing exports, he pointed out that till pre-pandemic, IIP and manufacturing exports moved in close tandem, but they completely diverged post-pandemic.  This is because, lot of incentives were announced under the PLI scheme, which led to an exponential jump in manufacturing exports. However, he notes that on the expenditure side the picture has improved considerably as private consumption has improved on the back of good urban demand with growth of 25.9 per cent.  He also said the much lower Q1 growth also compounds RBI's job, with rate hike trajectory in next two MPC meets trying to find a neutral ground amidst growth and inflation. On the external front the outlook is tilted towards the negative side with real exports growing only 14.7 percent as against imports growth of 37.2 percent. Sharp jump in imports and the rupee fall have taken down the net real exports to low 8.1 percent of GDP.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy-2/sbi-slashes-fy23-growth-forecast-to-6-8-on-way-below-q1-numbers-9119001.html
SBI,2022-08-30T12:34:01+05:30,Piyush Shukla,Kotak Bank says wrote twice to RBI noting significant variance in frauds reported by other banks,The private bank claimed there is a significant variance in what is chosen to be reported to the regulator by other banks. ,"Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank on August 30 said it wrote twice to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) during the current financial year requesting it to enforce standardisation in fraud reporting requirements by all banks.  “We have observed that there is significant variance in what is chosen to be reported to the regulator by other banks. We have appealed to the regulator vide our letters dated 17th March, 2022 and 30th August 2022 to enforce standardisation in reporting requirements,” the lender said in a clarification issued today to media reports.  The total number of frauds reported by Kotak Mahindra Bank to the regulator is in line with regulatory requirements and include instances of skimming, phishing, vishing, e-commerce frauds, across debit cards, credit cards, UPI, mobile banking, internet banking, payment gateways, among others, the bank said. “Regardless of whether customers and / or the bank faced losses, or whether the fraud amounts were recovered eventually,&quot; it added.  The clarification comes after a report said that Kotak Mahindra Bank recorded 5,278 cases of fraud in the first quarter (April to June) of the current financial year (2022-23), according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data. State Bank of India (SBI), meanwhile, reported only nine fraud cases during the same period, as per the report.  The media report cited data provided by Union Minister of State for Finance Bhagwant Karad to the Parliament on August 2.  As per the data, during the first quarter of current fiscal (Q1FY23), while some lenders declared no frauds, Kotak Mahindra Bank reported 5,278 frauds. Large banks including SBI reported 9 frauds during the first quarter of the current fiscal, while HDFC Bank reported 303 fraud cases, and ICICI Bank reported 436 cases of frauds.  Kotak Bank in its release today said for the period reported, of the 5,278 fraud instances reported by the bank to regulator, 97 percent of the complaints were associated to digital and card related frauds, that occur “due to customers unwittingly compromising their credentials by clicking on unknown links”, or giving access to their devices, among others.  “It is our submission that other banks do not appear to be exhaustively or uniformly reporting these types of frauds. Such frauds are not a reflection of any vulnerabilities in the bank’s secure infrastructure and systems,” Kotak Bank said.  As per RBI’s FY22 annual report, an assessment of bank group-wise fraud cases over the last three years indicates that while private sector banks have reported the maximum number of frauds, public sector banks contributed maximum to the fraud amount.  For instance, private lenders reported a total of 5,334 fraud cases amounting to over Rs 1 lakh during FY22, higher than 3,078 fraud cases reported by the state-led lenders. The total amount of frauds reported by private banks during the previous fiscal stood at Rs 17,588 crore while public sector banks reported frauds amounting to Rs 40,282 crore during the same period.  On an overall basis, lenders reported a total of 9,103 fraud related cases amounting to Rs 60,414 crore during FY22, lower than Rs 1.38 lakh crore of frauds reported during FY21.  Frauds have been occurring predominantly in the loan portfolio and while the number of frauds reported by private sector banks were mainly on account of small value card or internet frauds, the fraud amount reported by public sector banks was mainly in loan portfolio, the RBI annual report said.  Moneycontrol on August 29 reported that the RBI is working on a fraud registry that would help it keep repeat offenders at bay from the banking system.  &quot;The fraud registry will capture information like IP (internet protocol) addresses and phone numbers repeatedly used to commit frauds,&quot; Executive Director Anil Kumar Sharma said on August 29.  &quot;A mechanism for these details would be created so that banks can report these details to us. That will help us prevent these fraudsters using the banking infrastructure for perpetrating fraud after fraud after fraud,&quot; he added.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/kotak-bank-says-wrote-twice-to-rbi-noting-significant-variance-in-frauds-reported-by-other-banks-9106741.html
SBI,2022-08-29T11:32:45+05:30,Priyanka Iyer,"MC Investigation | Indian banks' repeated failures on mobile, internet platforms show the rot runs deep","Core banking systems that can't keep pace with rising load and fast digital changes, lack of an adequate number of talented tech professionals, and reluctance to invest in infrastructure for unremunerative UPI mean more system outages and glitches. ","Wonder why your bank's system is down quite often or why you face transaction declines repeatedly?  A Moneycontrol investigation into tech glitches reported by Indian banks across multiple platforms — mobile and internet — over the last few years has revealed major fundamental problems in their operations.  For one, most banks, including bigger ones, continue to use outdated technology platforms, making upgrades difficult. Secondly, these banks severely lack the adequate number of talented tech professionals to support large-scale tech-enabled banking operations, often resulting in major delays in the event of an outage.  Moneycontrol studied the tech outages reported by at least six banks in the recent past and spoke to at least 10 officials from these banks and technology firms.  Rising customer complaints  According to the central bank’s 2021 ombudsman scheme annual report, customers submitted a total of 44,385 complaints related to mobile and electronic banking between April 2020 and March 2021, higher than the 41,310 complaints recorded by the regulator in the previous year.  This is at a time when banks continue to launch new digital initiatives and so-called super apps.  To give an example, on June 30, a Twitter user posted a “maintenance” break screenshot from State Bank of India’s (SBI) banking application YONO. He complained that the bank had shared no communication with customers to alert them of the service outage.  As per the screenshot, the app’s services were not supposed to be available till 7 pm on June 30.  “19:00 hours already passed…,” Verma replied to his original tweet after the maintenance break passed its deadline. The same day saw many similar complaints by users saying that India’s largest public sector bank had not sent any prior notice for the scheduled break at a time when the country is pushing for further digitisation.   Source: Twitter  SBI is not the only one facing heat for such issues. On August 17, multiple Twitter users posted complaints of not being able to log into the bank website or app of India’s largest private sector bank – HDFC Bank. Similarly on August 13, many complained that net banking was not working since morning that day.  @HDFC_Bank your netbanking site not working from today morning, please check and resolve the problem — Satish Kumar (@SatishKRoy1976) August 13, 2022   “@HDFC_Bank your netbanking is down since an hour. I have payments to make and your site is just not working. Is it down for maintenance? If yes, no email or messages or any prior intimation was given to me,” tweeted user Ishita Shah.  Last year, the bank faced the wrath of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) after five major outages between November 2018 and March 2021. While RBI lifted the ban on all launches of its upcoming digital business-generating activities later, RBI’s diktat set the bank behind in competing with its peer ICICI Bank in credit card issuances as well as new digital initiatives.  Both SBI and HDFC Bank did not respond to detailed queries by Moneycontrol on the scheduled maintenance break or on the service outage.  Twitter is full of similar complaints across banks -- multiple users facing problems at once on some days.  What is the core issue?  The biggest strength of India’s largest banks is also the biggest Achilles' heel when it comes to technology – scale. Besides the burden on internal tech systems to handle the rising volumes of digital transactions, these are legacy systems with a heavy dependence on external service providers that plug in each layer of tech for banks.  “The large banks have the issue of using legacy technology from years ago. The bigger you are, the more difficult it is to upgrade. The risk is immense even while migrating from a large old database to a new one,” said the technology head of a leading fintech.  The core banking system of most banks is provided by large information technology players, including Infosys’ Finacle, Oracle and BaNCS by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). With the core system being operated by tech teams of these IT giants, internal teams of most banks only ensure that these systems are kept up and running.  “In one of our conversations with a smaller private bank that positioned itself as a digital bank, we were told that they have a tech team of 400 people. But not a single one of them wrote any code. Their entire job was to deal with their IT vendors,” the person added.  In such a situation, many experts believe that internal bank teams are largely deployed for ‘requirement management’ and not equipped to fix larger issues or build for evolving needs of customers.    Legacy problems  Aishwarya Jaishankar, who has led digital initiatives at various private sector banks and is now Co-Founder of Hyperface which provides tech stack for credit cards, said, “The core banking systems were built for the back offices and branches of banks and have scaled from there. But now modern customers want to be served digitally, needing a front-end focussed experience that banks are struggling to create with pure-play core banking systems.”  The core banking systems too are legacy software built over the past two decades and have reached a scale that makes it difficult to upgrade these to handle the increasing volumes. Hence, the knowledge required to operate these systems too is similar to what was required years ago.  Harshavardhan Godugula, Partner, Forensic and Integrity Services, EY, said, “Traditionally, core banking platforms are centralised systems – on top of which banks have built newer applications and capabilities, such as mobile banking, Unified Payments Interface (UPI), etc. Sometimes, these legacy systems are unable to perform adequately and face system downtime, vulnerabilities, hardware failures, etc. If banking apps are not built and tested properly, they are bound to throw back errors.”  Another disadvantage for large legacy banks is the difficulty in attracting the right talent and pay disparity as compared to large IT players and startups. “Large financial institutions have a hierarchical structure that makes decision-making difficult,” said another fintech founder.  Hyperface’s Jaishankar added, “While core banking is resilient, it has not evolved at the rate that innovation has taken place. Banks have to plug more third-party switches into the existing systems as the usage of real-time payments and other innovations increase pressure on the system.”  Nilufer Mullanfiroze, who has over two decades of experience working with banks like Standard Chartered and Federal Bank and is now Head of Banking at investment startup Groww argued that the time for technology to become redundant is only becoming shorter. Hence, it is not practical to expect large institutions to redo their systems.  &quot;But what needs to be the practical approach with most banks is to have the right infrastructure to build things on top of their core banking systems. Having the agility to be able to use the core banking system more as the backend system and build the right interfaces with newer age technology is the way to go for the future,&quot; she added.  The tide, however, has changed for the better after the regulator took cognisance of major outages across banks. Top management across banks are now more aware of the limitations of their technical capacities and seem to be working with the regulator around challenges.  Finally, the UPI hiccup…  “Since the last few days, when we try to send or receive money through UPI apps, the SBI server is down very often. Nowadays, people carry very less cash in hand. How are we supposed to transact seamlessly in such a scenario,” Sanket Rathi, an SBI customer for more than 10 years told Moneycontrol.  Failures on UPI payment systems are basically of two types, technical decline (TD) and business decline (BD). Technical declines are caused due to issues with the bank's system or NPCI systems, while business declines are caused due to issues pertaining to customers, such as incorrect PINs or transactions beyond stipulated limits.  “If we compare TDs to BDs, the former is always lesser than the latter. This is a clear result of seamlessness,” Venkatraman Venkateswaran, chief financial officer (CFO) at Federal Bank said.  To counter issues relating to reconciliation of timed out and declined transactions on the UPI platform, we might soon see the emergence of a tech that will allow real-time settlement of such transactions, he added.  Numbers don’t lie  The top five UPI remitter banks in terms of volumes in July were SBI, HDFC Bank, Bank of Baroda, Union Bank and ICICI Bank. For example, SBI's approval rate of UPI transactions was at 92.1 percent in July. The bank’s business decline rate stood at 7.26 percent as compared to 6.96 percent in June. The technical decline rate saw a steep drop to 0.68 percent in July from over 5 percent in June.  While the decline rates keep fluctuating every month, for the user dependent on UPI for all transactions, this is a major road bump. So why do UPI downtimes happen with banks?  Banks as well as the RBI have taken cognisance of the burden that the rise in UPI transactions has put on bank servers. Since the pandemic struck in March 2020, UPI monthly transaction values have grown by 5x from Rs 2 lakh crore to Rs 10.62 lakh crore in July 2022. What’s more is that UPI is used for multiple small-ticket transactions, including paying for an auto ride or even your local tea stall owner.  With over 600 crore transactions a month, the stress on bank servers is high.  “To add to that, the innovation is happening faster than the time banks can take to handle the growing transactions. With RuPay credit cards on UPI and UPI 123Pay, the number of transactions is expected to grow significantly,” said a senior executive of a payments company.    So, what are banks doing to address these problems?  Large banks are working towards pre-empting the problems that may emerge in the coming years as digital adoption increases further.  “While other private banks are trying to get their house in order, ICICI Bank is preparing for a wider presence in getting embedded across a large number of platforms where users transact. It is also preparing to scale horizontally and vertically,” said the founder of a fintech and bank infrastructure provider.  ICICI Bank did not respond to Moneycontrol’s request to participate in the story.  HDFC Bank chief executive officer Sashidhar Jagdishan, in a mail to employees in April 2021, had said that the bank has invested heavily in scaling up the infrastructure to handle any potential load that it will encounter for the next three to five years.  The bank is also setting up a digital factory and an enterprise factory to roll out new digital offerings and to help augment the bank’s IT infrastructure.  As for SBI, multiple reports suggest that the bank is in the process of upgrading its YONO app to offer a completely digital banking offering.  Another outlier is Federal Bank. The bank is known to invest heavily in modernising its internal tech capabilities, cloud adoption as well as target growth through tie-ups with fintechs. As per, customers are extensively using the bank’s internet banking platform due to the constant investments it has made.  “The enterprise or individual of today doesn't want to experience buffering pages. The 'lift and shift' model (migrating apps and data to cloud) of ensuring early adoption of tech will ensure that the sector is near glitch-free,” Federal Bank’s Venkateswaran said.  Union Bank of India General Manager Sanjay Narayan, who leads the lender’s digital initiatives, said that the lender has put in place a board-approved compensation policy whereby the bank compensates the customer for any financial loss that they may incur due to deficiency in service on the part of the bank, or any act of omission or commission directly attributable to the bank.  “With the growing customer base and increase in the number of digital products, robust infrastructure is a must. Adding new hardware to accommodate the continuous increase in digital transactions and customer base has become one of the important aspects of providing hassle-free banking services. Cloud is one of the growing spaces being used by entities for expansion of infrastructure,” Narayan said.  The UPI puzzle — To invest or not?  On UPI, industry experts have pointed out that banks see less incentive in investing further for UPI transactions as payment systems don't fetch enough revenues for banks and payment service providers, as per government norms.  “UPI has also introduced an orchestration approach due to its scale, something that was rarely conspicuous in the Indian banking system. But ensuring scalability with the right agility and security has its own costs. Government incentive will be helpful to take care of some of the costs associated with UPI,” Venkateswaran said.  In December 2021, the government had announced a Rs 1,300 crore scheme to incentivise banks, and through them payment gateways and UPI players for transactions. To be eligible for the full incentive, banks were required to show at least 50 percent year-on-year growth in UPI transactions by the end of the last quarter of the scheme.  With the Union Ministry of Finance’s recent clarification that the government has no plans to levy charges on UPI transactions, CRISIL Research Director Aniket Dani said that further government incentives in promoting UPI will aid in the upgradation of the existing services.  “The Ministry of Finance asserted on August 22 that would continue lending financial support to boost the digital payments ecosystem in the country. This help from the government will, in turn, aid the parties in the transaction to get monetary remuneration for the probable expenses associated with the same,” Dani said.  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/mc-investigation-indian-banks-repeated-failures-on-mobile-internet-platforms-show-the-rot-runs-deep-9100191.html

SBI,2022-08-15T18:33:22+05:30,PTI,SBI raises benchmark lending rates by up to 50 basis points,The increase in lending rate comes days after the Reserve Bank of India hiked its benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points to tame inflation.,"State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday raised its benchmark lending rates by up to 50 basis points (or 0.5 per cent), a move that will lead to an increase in EMIs for borrowers.  The increase in lending rate comes days after the Reserve Bank of India hiked its benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points to tame inflation.  External Benchmark based Lending Rate (EBLR) and Repo-Linked Lending Rate (RLLR) have been raised by 50 basis points while the hike in Marginal Cost of funds-based Lending Rate (MCLR) is 20 basis points across all tenure. The revised rates are effective from August 15, as per the information posted on SBI website.  SBI's EBLR rose to 8.05 per cent and RLLR increased by similar 50 basis points to 7.65 per cent. Banks add Credit Risk Premium (CRP) over the EBLR and RLLR while giving any kind of loan, including housing and auto loans.  With the revision, one-year MCLR has increased to 7.70 per cent, from the earlier 7.50 per cent, while for two years it rose to 7.90 per cent and for three years to 8 per cent. Most of the loans are linked to the one-year MCLR rate.  With the increase in lending rate, EMIs will go up for those borrowers who have availed loans on MCLR, EBLR or RLLR. From October 1, 2019, all banks including SBI have migrated to an interest rate linked to an external benchmark such as RBI's repo rate or Treasury Bill yield.

Of this, retail loan registered a growth rate of 18.58 per cent while corporate advances improved by 10.57 per cent year-on-year at the end of June quarter.

So, I'm quite hopeful that we should be in a position to sustain this in the subsequent quarters.&quot;  Corporate book should grow to the extent of about Rs 2.5-3 lakh crore during the year, he said, adding, even in SME (Small and Medium Enterprises) there are traction and pipeline is getting created.

On the prevailing economic situation, Khara said the effect of the Covid pandemic has subdued to a large extent, thanks to the governments' massive vaccination programme. The economy is almost on track with the resumption of air travel and removal of other containment measures by most of the countries, he said.  However, he said, the volatile geopolitical situation still poses a downside risk. The global output has contracted in the second quarter of this year going to the downturn in China and Russia. The Indian economy remains resilient despite global headwinds, resulting in rise in inflation, surge in crude prices, increase in commodity prices and disruption in supply chains, he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/to-sustain-loan-growth-of-15-in-current-fiscal-says-sbi-chairman-9031481.html

SBI,2022-08-11T13:08:39+05:30,Pushpita Dey,India’s home loan market set to double in next 5 years: SBI,"According to analysts, the fear of further rate hikes and loosing out the opportunity to buy properties will drive the customers to invest in homes.","India’s home loan market, currently valued at about Rs 24 lakh crore, is expected to double in the next five years, mirroring the overall trend in the country’s aspirations to become a $5 trillion economy by then, State Bank of India said in a report.  The share of housing loans in bank credit increased to 14.4 percent in June from 13.1 percent in March 2020, with the maximum number of disbursements in tier-3 and tier-4 cities, according to the SBI report.  Analysts said that the fear of further rate hikes and loosing out the opportunity to buy properties will drive the customers to invest in homes.  SBI, PNB Housing Finance and Bank of Baroda are among those that recorded significant growth in their home loan portfolios, according to their latest quarterly results.    Analysts said once the interest rate hike cycle starts, people tend to take home loans faster because they anticipate further hikes and fear that the longer they wait, the more expensive home loans will become.  The Reserve Bank of India has increased the benchmark interest rate by 140 basis points since May to curb inflationary pressures in the economy.  Disbursal of housing loans rose significantly in the April-June quarter and contributed almost half of the total personal and retail loans disbursed, according to SBI’s data.  Post-COVID security  When the RBI announced the rate hikes, analysts predicted that credit growth in the housing sector might get affected. However, the rate hikes created a positive impact in the last quarter.  “Firstly, it takes around three to four quarters to reflect the real impact of rate hike on loans. Now, banks have become more proactive as housing loans performed well in the last few quarters. Moreover, after COVID, people are now looking for safety and having his/her own house gives a sense of safety,” said Prakash Agarwal, director &amp;amp; head financial institutions at India Ratings &amp;amp; Research.  Moreover, analysts pointed out, banks convince customers to take loans at the earliest, before the interest rate goes up further, and this resulted in the rise in home loan disbursals.  Non-metropolitan areas  The report showed that growth in loans disbursed was primarily in non-metropolitan areas.  The total home loan portfolio (outstanding) grew by more than 10 percent in FY22, with tier-3 and tier-4 areas growing at a faster rate than tier-1 and tier-2 districts after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the SBI report.  The average loan size increased more in the smaller towns. The report noted that growth of loans in the Rs 30 lakh to Rs 50 lakh and the Rs 50 lakh to Rs 100 lakh brackets was higher in tier-3 areas than in tier-1 districts.  “If we also look at the coverage of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban scheme, which focusses on bridging the housing demand-supply mismatch in the country, the share of the Top 50 districts is a mere 21 percent in overall number of houses sanctioned. This clearly suggests the well-distributed nature of the PMAY-U scheme and one of the prime reasons for growth of housing finance across geographies beyond top cities,” said Aniket Dani, director, CRISIL Research.  According to analysts, the metros have become super-saturated and extremely expensive. So people now look for property that is affordable yet spacious.  “It may not be possible for an individual to buy a 2BHK apartment in Mumbai. But a bigger apartment will be affordable for him or her in Nashik or other districts. With the advantage of work from home, people don’t mind coming once in a while to office in the metros and then work remotely,” said Prakash Diwan, analyst and director at Altamount Capital Management.  It's mostly people who have spent a long time in the metros who choose to live in the smaller towns with better climatic conditions, more space and good accessibility, the analysts said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/indias-home-loan-market-set-to-double-in-next-5-years-sbi-9006351.html

SBI,2022-08-08T07:37:31+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Morning Scan: All the big stories to get you started for the day,A round-up of the biggest articles from newspapers,"#1. Boost GST collections, Prime Minister says as states flag fiscal woes  Chief ministers of various states highlighted their fiscal woes at NITI Aayog’s governing council meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who asked for collective action to increase GST collections. States should also develop a road map to implement the national education policy, he said. There were discussions on crop diversification and urban governance.  Why it’s important: The meeting of state and central leaders could lead to increased co-operation between them in the spirit of federalism. The meeting agenda also indicated upcoming policy directions.  #2. Tata Motors to acquire Ford’s Gujarat factory for Rs 726 crore  Tata Motors has signed an agreement with Ford Motor to acquire its plant in Sanand in Gujarat. Tata Motors will pay Rs 725.7 crore for the factory and the workforce. It includes the engine facility, which will be leased back to the US carmaker to cater to its global powertrain requirement.  Why it’s important: The Gujarat factory takeover will offer more capacity to Tata Motors, which intends to cross half a million annual unit sales in 2022-23. The company is operating at 85-90 percent capacity and needs additional capacity to sustain the sales momentum.  #3. State Bank of India set to start human resources subsidiary  State Bank of India will soon start a subsidiary that will look into human resources-related issues. The operations and support subsidiary has received in-principle approval from the Reserve Bank of India. The subsidiary will focus on managing branches in rural and semi-urban areas and is likely to be manned by staff recruited on a contractual basis.  Why it’s important: The bid by the country’s largest lender to manage costs efficiently follows the trend of hiring contractual staff to reduce overheads in many industrial and commercial sectors. State Bank will the first in the banking sector to do so.  #4. Petronas may set up green energy projects in India with ReNew Power  Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd is in talks with ReNew Energy Global to jointly set up green energy projects in India. Petronas may buy 49 percent stake from ReNew at the project level. Petronas has recently set up a unit to accelerate the adoption of clean energy, with a focus on Malaysia and India.  Why it’s important: Petronas’ interest comes when India is putting in place enabling provisions to make the use of clean energy, including green hydrogen, mandatory. The country is also instituting a regulatory framework for carbon trading.  #5. Market regulator may introduce stock payment system that bypasses brokers  The Securities and Exchange Board of India is mulling an ambitious plan to alter the payment mechanism in stock market trades. The regulator is discussing with infrastructure intermediaries the possibility of implementing a system that will result in money leaving an investor’s bank account only after a trade is completed. It would mean funds from an investor's bank account would not go to the broker but directly flow to settle the trade.  Why it’s important: Such a system already exists in the primary market. Its introduction in the secondary market is expected to minimize the handling of clients’ money by stockbrokers and will likely quicken the process of trade settlement.  #6. HDFC Bank said to have raised $300 million in non-resident external deposits  HDFC Bank is said to have raised up to $300 million in NRE deposits, offering up to 0.5 percentage point more than prevailing interest rates. These NRE deposits were garnered over two days last week. The Middle East led the list of new NRI depositors, followed by the rest of Asia and Europe.  Why it’s important: To slow the outflow of funds and ease the downward pressure on the rupee, the Reserve Bank has allowed lenders to attract deposits from NRIs without any ceiling to interest rates.  #7. Some FMCG firms see muted volumes amid rising inflation despite positive momentum  The June quarter was a mixed bag for FMCG companies in terms of volumes. Major firms Hindustan Unilever, Dabur India and Nestle India saw volume growth despite a high base. On the other hand, volumes of Britannia Industries, Marico and Godrej Consumer were impacted during the quarter. The June quarter was the first fully normal quarter for FMCG companies after two years of the pandemic. In the year-ago quarter, they saw strong volume growth on a low base because of a nationwide lockdown in 2020.  Why it’s important: Consumer firms are hoping robust sales during the festive season will life the pressure on volumes and margins. There are indications of a positive momentum, but inflation remains a worry.  #8. India’s imports of refined fuels from Russia see threefold jump  Imports of cheaper refined fuels from Russia, and not just crude oil, are gaining ground in the Indian market since the outbreak of the Ukraine war in February. Imports of Russian refined products have tripled in recent months from the preceding three-year average, according to energy cargo tracker Vortexa.  Why it’s important: Increasing Russian imports have displaced supplies from the Gulf, the US, and West Africa. Settlements of trades in rupees have helped.  #9. Mood at corporate India becomes upbeat as inflation pains set to ease  Inflationary pressures in the country are showing signs of plateauing, companies have indicated. They are readying for a positive impact, which might come with a lag on margins and consumption in the next three to six months. Overall, costs of certain commodities have reversed to June 2021 levels.  Why it’s important: Corporate houses are closely watching trends in consumer demand, which is showing signs of improvement since the beginning of August as the festive season kicks in early. A revival in demand is important for India to maintain its growth momentum.  #10. Offshore wind turbine makers may get production-linked incentives  The central government plans to introduce a production-linked incentive scheme to promote the making of offshore wind turbines. India has a Rs 24,000 crore PLI scheme for solar photovoltaic cells and modules to boost domestic manufacturing. The wind industry has lobbied for such a PLI scheme for the sector.  Why it’s important: The development comes when India is chasing a target to achieve 30GW offshore wind energy capacity by 2030.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/morning-scan-all-the-big-stories-to-get-you-started-for-the-day-275-8974231.html

SBI,2022-08-06T18:54:59+05:30,Piyush Shukla,"'Quite okay' with lowering stake in Yes Bank to 26% by March 2023, says SBI chairman","As bond yields soften, SBI will recover most of the mark-to-market losses made in Q1, Dinesh Kumar Khara said ","State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said on August 6 that the state-owned lender was okay with lowering stake in Yes Bank to 26 percent by the end of the financial year 2022-23 from 30 percent as on June 30.  The board, however, was yet to decide whether SBI would hold a 26 percent stake in Yes Bank in the next financial year, Khara said as the country’s biggest bank came out with its June quarter result.  “Till March 2023, we are required to hold 26 percent stake (in Yes Bank). If it all, our stake comes within 26 percent till March 2023, I am quite okay with that. Beyond that, we have not deliberated at the board level, so I am unable to comment anything relating to our further course of action,” Khara said in a post-earnings conference.  As on June end, SBI held a 30 percent stake in Yes Bank and ICICI Bank 3 percent. Axis Bank, IDFC First Bank and Bandhan Bank held between 1 and 2 percent stake each in the private sector lender.  Leading a consortium of lenders, SBI infused emergency capital amounting to Rs 10,000 crore in the distressed Yes Bank in 2020 when it approached bankruptcy. The embargo on SBI and other lenders to hold their shares in Yes Bank as part of a reconstruction scheme ends in 2023.  SBI, however, could potentially continue to maintain its holding in the Mumbai-headquartered bank even after the embargo ends on account of a good return on investment, Yes Bank managing director and chief executive officer Prashant Kumar told Moneycontrol on August 3.  “If any investment is giving me a good return, I have seen, as a behaviour, people would like to continue. But again, these calls will be taken by individual entities,” Kumar said.  Kumar’s comments came after Yes Bank announced that it would raise $1.1 billion in equity capital from private equity investors Carlyle and Advent International.  Q1FY23 earnings  SBI’s Q1FY23 net profit came in at Rs 6,068.1 crore, down 7 percent year-on-year (YoY) and 33 percent sequentially on account of loss in the treasury book and higher operating expenses.  Its other income, which includes treasury income, stood at Rs 2,312.2 crore, sharply lower from Rs 11,802.7 crore a year ago and Rs 11,880.2 crore in the previous quarter.  Net profit and operating profit were impacted by mark-to-market losses (MTM), Khara said, adding core revenue streams, however, remained intact and showed decent on-year growth.  “As we saw a hit on account of mark-to-market losses amounting to Rs 6,549 crore on our investment book, it also had an adverse impact on the bank’s RoA (return on asset) and RoE (Return on equity), which is down by 9 bps and 203 bps, respectively,” Khara said.  “As rates soften (bond yields), we will recover most of these MTM losses,” he added.  SBI has the largest portfolio of fixed income securities of which government securities form a big chunk. The rise in bond yields during the June quarter saw the lender incur huge losses in its trading book. When bond yields rise, their prices come down.  Banks are mandated to mark their investments to prevailing market prices and charge the gains or losses to the profit and loss account, also known as mark-to-market gains or losses.  Also read: SBI releases Q1FY23 results, here are top five takeaways  In terms of assets, SBI’s total loans grew 14.9 percent YoY and 2.9 percent sequentially to Rs 29 lakh crore as on June 30, in line with the industry average.  Of the total advances, domestic corporate loans grew 10.6 percent to Rs 8.74 lakh crore as on June end. Retail personal loans grew 18.6 percent YoY to Rs 10.34 lakh crore during the same period and home loans rose 13.8 percent on year at Rs 5.75 lakh crore.  “We are quite comfortable as far as supporting growth in credit is concerned,” Khara says.  The chairman said that the bank was witnessing sharp under-utilisation of capital from the sanctioned loan amount. In case of working capital loans, under-utilisation level was as high as 49 percent, he added.  Broadly, Khara said, SBI had about Rs 5 lakh crore of unutilised pending sanctioned loans and another Rs 1.3 lakh crore of corporate loans were in the pipeline.  “That very clearly indicates the likely growth which we are going to witness on the corporate side,” Khara said.  With demand flowing in from sectors including power, road, telecom, petrochemical, aviation and non-banking finance companies, SBI would likely continue growing its advances at 15 percent in the current fiscal, Khara said.  “Even the capacity utilisation in the economy is at 75 percent, and we have got a situation where I think more corporates will probably be looking at us for availing their credit facility as compared to options that were available in the past, in terms of raising money from securities market…,” Khara said.  Asset quality  Even as SBI’s headline gross non-performing asset ratio improved 6 bps QoQ to 3.91 percent as of June 30, its fresh slippages were sharply higher QoQ.  Fresh slippages rose to Rs 9,740 crore, up from Rs 2,845 crore a quarter ago. Fresh slippages, however, were lower than Rs 15,666 crore reported during Q1FY22.  “Slippages we should rather see much better situation…we are not having any major concerns on slippages and asset quality we don’t have any challenge,” Khara said in the press conference.  “…for all practical purposes, we compare (fresh slippages) on YoY basis,” Khara said. He added that SBI was trying to trim net NPA as well as credit cost as much as possible.  “It is a constant endeavour (to improve asset quality),” the chairman said.  Further, SBI’s Rs 28,785 crore restructured book was also performing better than expected. “If you look at NPAs itself in the restructured book, it would be somewhere around 1.9 percent, so when we compare it to broader book, it is much better,” Khara said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/quite-ok-with-lowering-stake-in-yes-bank-to-26-by-march-2023-sbi-chairman-says-8969621.html

SBI,2022-08-06T13:28:24+05:30,Aparna Iyer,"SBI Q1 result | Net profit of Rs 6,068 crore, misses street estimates","SBI Q1 results: The mark-to-market hit dragged SBI’s non-interest income down massively to a mere Rs 2,312 crore for the reported quarter compared with Rs 11,802 crore a year ago","State Bank of India on August 6 reported a net profit of Rs 6,068 crore for the June quarter, missing the Street estimates by a wide margin as treasury losses eroded profitability.  The average estimates of ten brokerages surveyed by Moneycontrol expected net profit at Rs 7,496 crore, a growth of 16 percent year-on-year (YoY). In contrast, India’s largest lender reported a drop of 6.7 percent in its profit after tax.  SBI has the largest portfolio of fixed income securities of which government securities form a big chunk. The sharp rise in bond yields during the April-June period meant that the lender had to incur huge losses in its trading book.  When bond yields rise, their prices come down. Banks are mandated to mark their investments to prevailing market prices and charge the gains or losses to the profit and loss account, also known as mark-to-market gains or losses.  The mark-to-market hit of Rs 6549 crore dragged SBI’s non-interest income down massively to a mere Rs 2,312 crore from Rs 11,802 crore in the year-ago quarter. This resulted in a fall of 32.8 percent in operating profit to Rs 12,753 crore for the quarter.  Chairman Dinesh Khara said the bank has taken measures to mitigate further losses from an increase in yields. &quot;We now seem fully insulated from rising bond yields,&quot; he said in a virtual press meet.  Beyond the treasury hit, SBI’s core performance was resilient.  Net interest income, the difference between the interest income the bank earns from its lending activities and the interest it paid to depositors, grew by a healthy 12.87 percent to Rs 31,196 crore for the June quarter on the back of a robust 14.9 percent loan growth and stable margins.  Provisions toward bad loans declined, as asset quality improved. Provisions declined 15 percent to Rs 4268 crore for the three months ended June 30, aiding net profit growth.  Balance sheet growth  SBI’s loan book showed a broad-based growth of 14.9 percent, as both corporate and retail loan books grew at a healthy pace.  Most analysts had expected the loan growth to be 14-15 percent for the quarter. Corporate loans grew by 10.57 percent YoY, while the retail book grew faster at 18.58 percent powered by strong growth in home loans.  Net interest margin (NIM) came in at 3.23 percent, an improvement of 8 basis points. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. That said, NIM was down sequentially.  As SBI’s loans earned it more interest due to lending rate hikes that the bank took during the quarter, growth in its low-cost deposits helped keep the cost of funds low.  Current and savings account deposits grew by 6.5 percent and formed 45.33 percent of the total deposit book. Deposits as a whole grew by 8.73 percent for the quarter.  Asset quality  SBI’s gross bad loans ratio improved from the year-ago period and its already strong provision cushion strengthened further.  The total pile of gross bad loans declined 15 percent from a year ago to Rs 1.13 lakh crore as of June end. Gross bad loans formed 3.91 percent of the loan book as against 5.32 percent in the same quarter of the previous financial year.  On a net basis, non-performing loans formed just 1 percent of the total loan book. Slippages, too, remained contained with the slippage ratio at 1.38 percent, down from 2.47 percent a year ago. Fresh slippages were down 37 percent to Rs 9,740 crore from Rs 15,666 crore a year ago.  That said, asset quality metrics weakened on a sequential basis. The slippage ratio was up 95 basis points from the previous quarter.  In fact, June quarter slippages exceeded that of the previous three quarters put together.  Khara said the bank sees no challenges on asset quality, both from corporate and retail loans. Small business loans, though may pose some trouble if the recovery slows. The bank is targeting net bad loans to be 1 percent or less going forward.  The lender, however, won't shun riskier loans by only underwriting top-rated entities, Khara said. &quot;Our endeavour would be to keep credit costs low but we are very mindful that there is a risk involved and we cannot only underwrite AAA,&quot; he said.  He added that mispricing of risk has come down as liquidity surplus in the banking system was coming down. Following the coronavirus pandemic, SBI warned that a surge in liquidity surplus due to an easy monetary policy could be leading to banks' mispricing or underpricing riskier loans.  SBI aims to balance incremental risks arising out of lending towards small businesses or lower-rated companies. The bank has got board approval to raise Rs 11,000 crore capital to grow its loan book in FY23.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/sbi-reports-q1-net-profit-of-rs-6068-crore-misses-street-estimates-8968401.html
SBI,2022-08-04T13:18:36+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"SBI Preview for Q1: Net profit likely to rise 16%, but treasury may be a drag",Healthy loan growth may be offset by mark-to-market losses on the bank’s bond portfolio after a surge in yields in the June quarter. ,"  State Bank of India (SBI) is expected to report robust balance sheet growth, improvement in asset quality and healthy core interest income for the June quarter.   Treasury operations could prove to be the Achilles’ heel of the country’s largest lender in the quarter ended June, for which it will report its earnings on August 6.   An average of the estimates by 10 securities firms shows that SBI’s June quarter net profit would be Rs 7,495 crore, up 16 percent year-on-year.   That would come on 17% growth in net interest income, seen at Rs 32,424 crore for the quarter. This would be one of the strongest growth rates in core interest income (NII) for the bank in recent times.    Interest margin   The increase in NII is driven by the bank’s ability to earn more out of lending and at the same time reduce the amount of dud loans on which it doesn’t earn any interest.   To that extent, movement in the net interest margin also reflects the core interest income besides overall loan growth.    SBI’s NIM remained stable, even improved, in FY22 because of its advantage over peers in having a large base of low-cost current and savings account (CASA) deposits.    CASA as a percentage of total deposits was 45 percent in FY22 with the added benefit that SBI pays one of the lowest interest rates on its savings deposits.   Analysts believe NIM would have remained stable in the June quarter and some expect a sequential improvement.   “Sequential NII growth would be healthy due to positive loan mix changes and yield on advances evolving higher at a faster pace than cost of deposits due to repricing of externally benchmarked loans, implying NIM expansion on sequential basis,” those at Yes Securities Ltd wrote in an earnings preview.   Lending growth   Loan growth is expected to be healthy and in double digits. “Retail growth is likely to remain strong. This, along with a pick-up in the SME (small and medium enterprise) and Corporate book (as the un-utilized limit continues to moderate), will support loan growth,” Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a report.   Analysts expect loans to expand by 14-15 percent year-on-year, led by retail and SMEs.   Asset quality, treasury losses   That brings us the asset quality and here analysts seem to differ on the extent of improvement. Those at Kotak Institutional Equities see overall improvement in bad-loan ratios but slippages may come in slightly higher.   “We expect slippages at 1.6% of loans (Rs11,000 crore) mostly driven by SME and retail while corporate will continue to hold up relatively well,” Kotak analysts wrote in their note.    SBI’s slippage ratio was 1.1 percent in the March quarter. Analysts at Axis Securities expect slippages to moderate on a sequential basis.   Yet another factor where analysts seem to differ is the magnitude of treasury losses. SBI has one of the largest bond portfolios dominated by government bonds.   Bond yields surged during the June quarter, resulting in mark-to-market losses to most banks. Considering the size of SBI’s trading book, the mark-to-market hit is expected to be sizeable.   Kotak estimates SBI’s operating profit to drop by a massive 40 percent year-on-year due to treasury losses. In fact, Kotak predicts even the net profit to drop 26 percent, contrary to most analysts who expect an increase. The firm puts SBI’s treasury loss at more than Rs 11,000 crore for the quarter.   The upshot is that SBI’s operating metrics could reflect pain from its treasury book. Investors would keenly follow the management’s outlook on loan growth and asset quality.   ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/sbi-q1-preview-net-profit-seen-16-up-but-treasury-could-be-a-drag-8950361.html

While many private sector and some public sector banks had gone live on the AA framework, some of India’s largest PSU banks including State Bank of India (SBI), Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Indian Bank among others, were yet to onboard the platform until July. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had reportedly instructed these banks to go live on the AA framework by end of July.  The participation of major PSU banks is key to the success of AA’s framework as it will open a window for a huge pool of the banks’ customers to use the framework and allow easy access to financial services. Today, these PSU banks cater to a large chunk of India’s population.  In January, Moneycontrol reported that SBI was working on a pricing model because the bank wants to be compensated as it will be the largest information provider. The bank was also working on the infrastructure needed to manage and share the huge pool of data it possesses as the data is supposed to be accessed from its core banking system, which will require additional levels of security and audits.  What is AA framework?  The AA ecosystem facilitates sharing of financial information on a real-time basis between regulated entities. AAs are licensed by the Reserve Bank of India to enable the flow of data between Financial Information Providers (FIPs) and Financial Information Users (FIUs). The user has to give consent on what data can be shared.  The AA acts as an intermediary and the information comes from FIPs like banks, AMCs, pension funds etc, and FIUs that consume this data. FIUs, again, can be a bank giving out a loan, an insurance provider or a wealth manager, among others. FIUs and FIPs must be registered with and regulated by any of the four regulators – RBI, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI), Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA).  Companies including CAMFinServ, Perfios Account Aggregation Services, Yodlee Finsoft, NESL Asset Data, Finsec AA solutions have received approval from the RBI to operate as AAs.  Additionally, players like PhonePe, Setu, and Tally, among others have received an in-principle nod from the RBI.  In April, India’s market regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), had said that it will also join the AA framework.   Currently, all PSU banks are working with one AA each, while private sector banks are working with all AA service providers. Eventually, PSU Banks too are expected to work with all companies offering AA services to ensure that customers have the option to choose which AA's app they wish to use.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mutual-funds/account-aggregator-ecosystem-gets-a-boost-as-all-psu-banks-go-live-8940701.html
SBI,2022-07-25T11:23:40+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan,Banking Central | What does a bigger HDFC Bank mean for its closest rival?,"SBI has enjoyed a monopoly over Indian banking since 1955 but that’s about to change following HDFC Bank's merger with HDFC. With an asset book of Rs 17.86 trillion, not too far from SBI’s Rs 26.64 trillion, HDFC Bank can challenge the state-owned lender's dominance, especially in the big-ticket loan market","India’s biggest private lender HDFC Bank is set to become even bigger—both in terms of assets and market valuation.  After its merger with the parent, mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC),  the Mumbai-headquartered bank's market capitalisation will rise from Rs 7.76 trillion to around Rs 12 trillion after adding HDFC’s about Rs 4.16 trillion, according to a Moneycontrol calculation, way ahead of Rs 4.6 trillion of State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest bank.  In terms of assets, too, the difference will show.  New sheriff in town  The merger will see HDFC Bank’s assets rise to Rs 17.86 trillion, inching closer to SBI’s Rs 26.64 trillion. In another few years, HDFC Bank can emerge as a serious contender to SBI in India-focused larger loan deals, in the country and elsewhere.  SBI’s dominance is about to be challenged.  Since 1955, no bank has come closer to the state-owned lender’s massive asset size. Formerly Imperial Bank of India, which owns a fifth of the market share in assets and a quarter in loans and deposits, is the rate-trendsetter in the Rs 120-trillion Indian credit market.  But this will change after HDFC Bank’s merger with the parent.    The deal also gives HDFC Bank something it didn’t have—home loans. It has thrived on consumer loans but lacked strength in the juicy mortgage market. Its home loan book is minuscule compared with its book size.  Only 2 percent of HDFC Bank’s customers source home loans through the lender and about 70 percent of the parent’s customers do not bank with HDFC Bank. But, the merger with HDFC—the giant in the mortgage business—will address this glaring gap.  Also read: HDFC Bank receives RBI nod for merger with HDFC   Now for some hard work   Going big on the elusive mortgage business reignites HDFC Bank’s ambition to be the market leader but it won’t be a walk in the park. Finding the synergy with the parent’s work culture—an emotional connect with clients—is the key.  To grow big, HDFC Bank needs to catch up on the liability side. It needs to add at least Rs 5.5 trillion deposits in FY24-25 to replace HDFC’s high-cost borrowings, Emkay Global’s analysts have said.  That means tough work for branches and some rate tinkering.  Also read: HDFC Bank-HDFC merger: All you need to know about the impact on customers  To dethrone SBI and lure bigger international clients, HDFC Bank will need to go big on a safe, mortgage book and let go of risky corporate and unsecured loans.  It will also need a better tech team and alert risk managers to avoid past run-ins with a watchful central bank.  For the regulator, too, bigger banks mean bigger challenges. HDFC Bank is a systemically important or a “too-big-to-fail” bank in India. The combined entity will warrant closer scrutiny by the regulator.

SBI,2022-07-14T12:59:06+05:30,Pushpita Dey,How will the rise in FCNR(B) rates affect bank financials?,"While the move is expected to spark a surge in foreign currency deposits, the hike in rates could affect banks' profit margins as their cost of funds may end up rising.    ","Recently, a clutch of banks, including State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC and ICICI Bank, sharply increased interest rates on Foreign Currency Non-Resident (Bank) or FCNR(B) deposits. The move to hike rates was in sync with the Reserve Bank of India’s efforts to boost fund inflows and support the freefalling rupee by shoring up forex reserves, which fell to a 14-month low at the end of June.  FCNR(B) deposits are essentially fixed deposits held in foreign currency. They are used by non-resident Indians, persons of Indian origin and overseas citizenship of India card holders to invest their money in India, using foreign currency, for good returns.  These deposits constitute a minuscule portion of Indian banks’ total deposits. They were equivalent to slightly over 2 percent of total savings deposits at the beginning of this financial year, at $16.14 billion (April). Total savings deposits stood at Rs 15.79 lakh crore or approximately $750 billion in March, according to the latest RBI data.  While their quantum is modest, experts believe the rise in FCNR (B) deposit rates will spark a surge in the inflow of these deposits.  Analysts, meanwhile, believe the move to raise the FCNR(B) deposit rate will affect banks' profit margins as their cost of funds may end up rising. The experts added that it is difficult to say by how much the cost would go up because there will be variations across banks, tenors and the currency of deposit.    Is bank profitability at stake?  Be it the FCNR (B) rate hike or domestic rate hikes, banks’ profit margins will only be affected in case they are not able to pass on the rate hikes to customers through lending rates and other measures as their cost of funds will also go up, say bankers.  Additionally, even if they are unable to lend, they can park excess liquidity with the RBI’s standing deposit facility (SDF) which has risen compared to its pre-pandemic level, according to economists. Under the new monetary policy, SDF helps the central bank absorb liquidity (deposits) from commercial banks without giving government securities in return to the banks.  The SDF rate is currently 25 bps below the policy repo rate of 4.90 percent, while the Marginal Standing Facility rate, or the rate at which banks obtain liquidity overnight, is 25 bps above the policy repo rate. Hence, with these rate hikes, the RBI has restored the width of the Liquidity Adjustment corridor to the pre-pandemic 50-basis-point symmetry around the policy repo rate.  With measures to pass on the rate hike through lending operations as well, banks manage to balance the impact of the hike and protect their profit margins.  “In 2013, the RBI had announced a similar FCNR deposit scheme, and after that, the RBI and banks had tried to precisely address forex risks. Now, deposit rates are going up — not only for FCNR deposits but also for local deposits — following the rate hike cycle. Credit growth is picking up and loan rates are also going up,” says Sakshi Gupta, principal economist, HDFC Bank.  If banks are able to take calculated measures in terms of lending, investments and other aspects, they can safeguard their profitability even with the rise in the FCNR(B) rate.  “It has always been seen that whenever deposit rates go up, lending margins also improve. Moreover, we have about $400 million (Rs 3,000 crore) in FCNR (B) deposits whereas the total deposits we have are more than Rs 1.8 lakh crore,” says Ashutosh Khajuria, ED, Federal Bank.  “If banks transmit the full impact of the rate hike to customers, margins will be protected. But lending rates are market driven,” explains Virat Diwanji, Group President and Head – Consumer Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank. He adds that banks offering lower rates of interest on loans are likely to attract more customers. So, passing on interest hikes through lending rates may not help them to completely balance profit margins.  But analysts and bankers expect the rate transmission to be better on the lending side as most floating loans are linked to external benchmarks. “Since external benchmarks have gone higher than other benchmarks like MCLR, banks should benefit in terms of margins in the near-term. However, deposits are also expected to reprice upward gradually, and the improvement in margins may not sustain barring changes driven by changes in product mix,” added Choksey.  Increase in demand from overseas deposits  Experts say that with higher FCNR (B) rates, overseas investors can earn a safer return compared to rupee-denominated deposits. Banks will now attract greater participation from overseas deposits.  “Currently, inflation in India is hovering around the 7% range, which is higher than the RBI’s inflation target. Inflation is expected to remain high in the coming months. When the currency depreciates because of inflation, FCNR deposits work like a hedge against it,” explains Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.com.  Naveen Kukreja, CEO and Co-founder, Paisabazaar, concurs. “As many of the advanced economies are registering steeper rate increases, higher FCNR deposit rates offered by the banks should increase the attractiveness of these deposits among NRIs. Higher inflows from NRIs would then provide some support to our forex reserves and the rupee,” he says.  Inflows are likely to go up, specifically from the US, as the yield in the US T-Bill and some other bonds offer lower returns. “Currently FCNR (B) rates vary from 2.85-3.50 percent for a one-year deposit, which is higher than the 2.8-2.9 percent yield on the 1 year US$ T-bill. The flow from overseas deposits will depend on the short-term rates in overseas markets and associated hedging costs for the banks,” said Aashay Choksey, Assistant Vice President, Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA.  Quantum of hike surprises economists  After the RBI announced its forex measures in the first week of July, some economists were expecting a rate increase of 25-30 bps. But the banks have hiked the rate by nearly 100 basis points to improve domestic FX liquidity conditions.  Banks are trying their best to be at par with the rates offered by banks in foreign countries and with the Fed rate hikes, so they have increased rates more than expected.  “FCNR is a deposit denominated in foreign currencies. In countries like the US, for deposits with a tenure of two to five years, the rate is close to 3 percent and more. The interest rate here can’t be lower than that offered in US government bonds,” said Federal Bank’s Khajuria.  Moreover, banks have taken calculated measures keeping in mind the probable rate hikes that may happen in the upcoming policy meetings, added bankers.  “Given the Fed rate hike guidance, median policy rates are expected to be 3.8 percent by December 2023, which means that the cost of raising these overseas deposits will rise further for Indian banks. Unless the hedging costs decline, or the RBI assures banks of the exchange rate in future being at competitive rates, the deposits may not be lucrative for overseas depositors,” says Choksey.  “While interest rates are rising in India, so are the interest rates in other countries. They have to think about the opportunities that are available there. There will be banks falling over each other to get more money from NRIs,” added  Diwanji of Kotak Mahindra Bank.  Moreover, banks are pricing in future rate hikes as well, counting those that may happen in upcoming policy measures — it is likely that there may be a hike of 50-75 bps. “The FCNR rate was last revised long ago, pre-pandemic. It has been done this time to cover up their costs,” adds Sarbartho Mukherjee, economist, Mahindra Group.  The inflationary pressures in India are lower than in the US and some of the other advanced economies. Thus, the quantum of policy rate hikes in India should be lower than the rate hikes executed by the Federal Reserve. However, apart from the repo rates, the rate hikes by Indian banks have been determined by overall credit demand and liquidity in the Indian financial system, as well as their overall asset-liability management requirements.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/how-will-the-rise-in-fcnrb-rates-affect-bank-financials-8826981.html
SBI,2022-07-13T10:49:11+05:30,Shubham Raj,"PSU banks duck market volatility, improving performance keeps analysts, investors bullish","Most of the book cleanup is done now. High provisions coverage, which for some banks are as high as 85 percent, give the state-run lenders enough security to be aggressive","Through the last three-odd weeks, the PSU banking sector – a perpetual underperformer – remained largely insulated from the overall volatility roiling the markets and stayed in the positive territory, thanks to an improving investor sentiment.  The Nifty PSU Bank index is up 15 percent since June 20, led by heavy buying in leading names like Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank. The stocks climbed 20 and 24 percent in the period, while some of the other stocks from the sector have also performed relatively better. The Nifty Private Bank index – which keeps analysts gung ho – has gained merely 8 percent in comparison.  A Changing Narrative    In the last decade, public sectors banks (PSBs) have often been overlooked, and rightly so, given their inefficiency in the face of rising competition. This reflects in their share prices with the Nifty PSU Bank index down 35 percent since 2011. The Nifty Private Bank index jumped over three-fold in this period.  The 2008 market crash triggered by the global financial crisis and the following years kept the state-run lenders grappling with the series of issues. Their market share was snatched by the more aggressive private banks, non-performing assets piled up after the real estate sector crumbled, financials took a major hit with huge provisions and write-offs, and repeated scams left them gasping under bad debt burden.  This is however seems to be a turnaround time for the beleaguered state-run banks.  Most of the book cleanup is done now. High provisions coverage, which for some banks are as high as 85 percent, give them enough security to be aggressive. Provision coverage ratio (PCR) for HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are in the 70s.  “Inhone apne padosi ka bhi provision kar rakha hai (they have made provision for their neighbors too),” quipped MK Ventures founder Madhusudan Kela at TV show last week.  Also, working for them is high recovery rates in recent years, thanks to a resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, especially for loans that have been written off as they directly improve the profitability.  Mohit Nigam, Head of PMS at Hem Securities, agrees that the high PCR gives the PSU banks a sense of security. “Since public sector banks' balance sheets are now strong enough for them to focus on expansion, FY22 was a pivotal period for them,” he said, pointing at their accelerated loan and deposit growth.  Many PSBs have beaten their own projections on credit growth. The approach has been to be conservative in their guidance to account for any oversight, and grow aggressively. In FY22, Canara Bank had targeted a loan growth of 7.5 percent and closed the year at 9.77 percent. For FY23, the lender has given guidance of a minimum growth of 8 percent. “We expect to grow at 10 percent this year,” chief executive LV Prabhakar said in May.  The credit growth, however, is yet to match pace of private lenders like HDFC Bank that grows around 20 percent year-on-year. “What will drive further rerating in these banks (PSU banks) is their ability to grow,” said Nishit Master, Portfolio Manager, Axis Securities.  What also works for them, according to Nigam, is better reach, cheaper cost of funding, and a strong capital base. He also pointed out that the government has urged bankers to become more competitive and recapture market share.  Are All Animals Equal?   Not every bank among PSBs has shown the improvement like that of Canara Bank or Bank of Baroda. Some are still struggling to shake off the iron chains. Punjab National Bank, Bank of India and Central Bank of India are among those that have not shown the tenacity displayed by their peers, said analysts.  Thus, analysts have been selective in their approach, so have been investors who have largely avoided these names. “We prefer playing PSU banks through quality names like SBI and Bank of Baroda. In terms of management quality and technology, these banks are better placed than other PSU banks,” said Master.  In the near term, there are some nagging issues, but that is something which affects everyone and not just PSBs. “With an increase in interest rates, these banks will be hit by market-to-market (MTM) loss on their treasury book. But, we believe that markets will consider them as one-offs,” he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/funds-raining-on-psu-banks-as-improving-performance-keeps-analysts-investors-bullish-8818741.html

The court has also slapped a fine of Rs 2,000 to be deposited within four weeks.  Mallya had disbursed an amount of $ 40 million to his family members in violation of court orders. It was for this that he was held guilty of contempt of court. Today, the apex court noted that Mallya, despite being found guilty of contempt, never showed remorse, and did not apologise.  In a major step, the Supreme Court has directed for reversing these transactions to the tune of $40 million and directed for the amount along with 8% interest to be deposited within a period of four weeks.  Also Read: Rs 19,000 crore-worth assets of fugitive Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi seized: Govt  In March this year, the apex court had reserved its order on the quantum of punishment to be given to Mallya in the contempt of court case.  Pertinently, Mallya had failed to make any submissions on the issue of quantum of punishment before the Supreme Court despite the top court's affording the chance to him.  The court had deferred hearing of the case on earlier occasions to allow time to Mallya to present his case before the court either personally or through a counsel. However, Mallya neither appeared before the court nor was his counsel able to obtain instructions from him.  The top court thus proceeded to hear the case and reserved its judgment after hearing amicus curiae at length. The apex court had appointed Senior Advocate Jaideep Gupta as the amicus curiae, that is, a friend of the court, for assistance in the case.  A last chance was yet again given to Mallya to make his case through written submissions.  The judgment today pertains to a 2017 ruling of the top court where Vijay Mallya was found to be guilty of contempt of court for willfully violating the court's orders. The conviction for contempt of court was affirmed by the Supreme Court when Mallya's plea seeking review of the ruling was also dismissed.  Mallya was directed to be present before the court for hearing on quantum of punishment, however he remained unavailable owing to the extradition proceedings that were pending against him at the time in the UK.  After the extradition proceedings were concluded, one leg of the proceedings, the nature of which was unknown to the Indian authorities were still underway in the UK.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/legal-trends/sc-sentences-vijay-mallya-to-4-month-jail-in-contempt-of-court-case-8808371.html

At a case management hearing at the Chancery Division of the High Court in London on June 27, Justice Tom Leech concluded that a set of interlinked hearings in the matter would be heard together.  The case, which involves a consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) seeking the repayment of an estimated judgment debt of around GBP 1.05 billion owed by the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines, is now likely to come up in the courts next year.

Meanwhile, his lawyers have argued that the Indian banks have been pursuing the same debt against him both in India and the UK.  This week, the court was told the bankruptcy proceedings had damaged Mallya’s reputation and failed to take into account the assets already seized in India.

SBI,2022-06-24T06:21:41+05:30,Piyush Shukla,SBI versus HDFC Bank: How will the battle of titans in Indian banking shape up?,"On April 13, SBI Chairman Dinesh Khara had said that the bank will likely see more than 10 per cent loan growth in FY23.  ","State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara on Wednesday said the bank was “very mindful” of the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger and was taking necessary steps to beat competition.  His comments came on the heels of HDFC Bank’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (MD &amp;amp; CEO) Sashidhar Jagdishan saying in the bank’s FY22 annual report that “quite simply”, the lender could have not afforded missing the chance of the proposed merger with Housing Development Finance Corp (HDFC).  Analysts say the aggressive growth commentaries from the chiefs of two large banks show that credit demand, after hovering in single digits during the pandemic and till earlier this year, will likely pick up this fiscal. As the country’s largest private bank and public sector bank combat to gain market share, Moneycontrol analyses how the two lenders’ assets and deposits compare with each other, and whether SBI will be able to secure its age-old leadership position in the banking industry.  Assets  SBI’s loan book stood at Rs 26.64 lakh crore as on December end, up 8.5 per cent year-on-year (YoY). Retail personal loans at Rs 9.52 lakh crore as on December 31, rose 14.6 percent. Corporate loans, however, de-grew 0.7 percent to Rs 7.83 lakh crore. In a conversation with CNBC TV-18 on April 13, Khara had said that the bank will likely see more than 10 percent loan growth in the current fiscal.  Credit offtake is happening essentially in the iron, steel and cement sectors, and capital expenditure was also being seen in the automobile and e-mobility sectors, he said. Infrastructure projects are also driving credit demand in airport and port sectors, he added.  When asked whether the merger of the HDFC twins will challenge SBI’s market share in the home loan segment, Khara said the bank will be “more than happy” to rejig its products and platform to capture demand.  “I always feel that competition brings more and more agility. I think, being the largest home loan provider, that is a trigger for us to ensure that we should stay the largest ever. So, for that, whatever is required to be done, we will be more than happy… looking into our product and platform,” he said.  The combined advances of HDFC Bank and HDFC, as per an official company document seen by Moneycontrol, stand at Rs 17.86 lakh crore as on December end on proforma basis.  Analysts at ICICI Securities maintained its ‘Buy’ rating with a Rs 1,330 price target on HDFC Bank on June 23 saying the runway for the bank in terms of growth is huge and it can add one HDFC Bank every five years.  “The CEO’s message is similar to what was articulated during the analyst day on 31 May 2022 highlighting why this is an opportune time to fructify the merger given housing loan growth opportunity with deeper penetration, regulatory convergence, conducive market development, pricing convergence, portfolio rebalancing, enhanced cross-sell,” it said.  While SBI will continue its focus expanding its digital footprint across country, HDFC Bank plans to open between 1,500 and 2,000 branches each year for the next three to five years, as per Jagdishan.  “The branch will be digital from a customer on-boarding and transaction/servicing perspective. It will provide the emotional connect and relationship management necessary for offering financial solutions to our customers. These branches will be small in size and will be phygital relationship centres,” Jagdishan said.  “This will enable us to go after the catchment more aggressively and build the required liability franchise that we are known for, and we are confident that we would execute well,” he added.  As on March end, HDFC Bank’s total banking outlets stood at 21,683, while total branches, including four overseas, stood at 6,342. The lender’s total ATMs and cash deposit machines were at 18,130 at the end of March, and it had 15,341 business correspondents (BCs) in its network.  Further, as only 2 per cent of HDFC Bank customers source their home loans through the bank, the scope for rise in mortgage loans is immense, the MD said.  “Home loan customers typically keep deposits that are five to seven times that of other retail customers. And about 70 percent of HDFC Ltd’s customers do not bank with us. All these gives us an idea about the size of the opportunity,” he added.  HDFC Bank has a home loan agreement with HDFC, according to which HDFC Bank sources loans for the parent for a 1.10 percent fee, with the right to buy 70 percent of the loans it originates. Due to the agreement, HDFC Bank could only source home loans from 2,000 of the over 6,500 branches it had as on March end, an HDFC source said.  Liabilities, asset quality  On the liabilities side, SBI’s total deposits stood at Rs 38.47 lakh crore as on December-end, while HDFC Bank’s total deposits stood at Rs 16.01 lakh crore on a proforma basis.  The low-cost current account, savings account (CASA) deposits for SBI stood at Rs 17 lakh crore as on December-end, while HDFC Bank had total CASA deposits of Rs 6.81 lakh crore on a standalone basis in same period.  Further, SBI’s net interest margin (NIM) stood at 3.40 per cent as on December end, while HDFC Bank’s core NIM stood at 4.1 per cent.  “Overall, factoring in the regulatory requirements (CRR+SLR+PSL) and assuming that 20 percent of high-cost HDFC borrowings are replaced, our workings suggest that the bank will have to mobilise deposits to the tune of Rs 5.5 trillion over FY24-25, which need to be met through a combination of growing vintage of branches and accelerated growth via some rate tinkering,” brokerage Emkay Global said in a report dated May 23.  “However, the deposit ask can be reduced by slowing down HDFC’s growth, increasing affordable housing/PSL-compliant loan growth, phased grandfathering of HDFC’s bank borrowings, and even raising relatively cheap overseas bonds,” it added.  In terms of asset quality, SBI’s headline numbers were higher than HDFC Bank.  While SBI’s gross and net non-performing asset (GNPA, NNPA) ratio stood at 4.50 per cent and 1.34 per cent as on December end, respectively, HDFC Bank’s corresponding numbers stood at 1.26 per cent and 0.37 per cent for the same period.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/sbi-versus-hdfc-bank-how-will-the-battle-of-titans-in-indian-banking-shape-up-8729291.html

Special sessions were organised on income tax matters related to pensioners as well as digital means of submitting annual life certificates, said the statement by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. It was decided that immediate efforts are needed for the creation of an integrated pension portal by linking the existing portals of the DoPPW and the SBI to provide seamless services to pensioners, it said.  Face authentication technology for digital life certificate may be advertised extensively by banks, the statement said. Digital life certificate and face authentication technology would be a game changer for pensioners and banks in the submission of life certificates, it said.  It is expected that through these programmes, the objective of enhancing ease of living' of pensioners will be achieved to a great extent, the statement said. Four such awareness programmes will be conducted in collaboration with the State Bank of India to cover the whole country, it said.

He claimed that, among the world's large nations, India's economy is one of the most stable in the current circumstances.","State Bank of India chairman Dinesh Khara on Friday said the improvement in capacity utilisation to 74 per cent from 69 per cent shows that the economy is geared for its natural growth. He said among the large nations across the globe, India is one of the most stable economies in the current situation.  &quot;The way the capacity utilisation in the economy has improved from 69 per cent to 74 per cent, and is inching upwards, it is a clear sign that the economy is poised for its natural growth,&quot; Khara said at a banking event organised at the Financial Express newspaper. He said the country has handled the pandemic in the best possible manner and the economy is performing pretty well.  Talking about the credit demand, Khara said retail and corporate sectors are both witnessing the momentum. &quot;I would say it (credit demand) is universal. Our retail book continues to grow at more than 16 per cent per annum. This has been the trend for more than 4-5 years.  &quot;On the corporate side, there was a time when corporates were raising money from the market also but now gradually they are moving towards banks for availing CP (Commercial Paper) funding. So that also is a new engine of growth,&quot; Khara said. Speaking at the event, Standard Chartered CEO Zarin Daruwala said over the last four-five months, there has been an increase in demand for working capital loans owing to a surge in commodity prices.  There is demand for loans from the MSME segment after the government launched the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/improvement-in-capacity-utilisation-a-clear-sign-of-natural-growth-in-economy-sbi-chairman-8702091.html
SBI,2022-06-13T21:48:44+05:30,PTI,"RBI much ahead in containing inflation, but two more rate hikes likely, says SBI report","According to an SBI research report released on Monday, the Reserve Bank is far ahead of the curve in managing inflation, which appears to have peaked, albeit it may raise interest rates in August and October","The Reserve Bank is much ahead of the curve in containing inflation, which appeared to have peaked, though it may go for an interest rate hike in August and October, according to an SBI research report. After rising to a 95-month (almost 8 years) high of 7.79 per cent in April, Consumer Price Index (CPI) based inflation moderated to 7.04 per cent in May.  Core CPI also moderated in May to 6.09 per cent compared to 6.97 per cent in April, as per the SBI's research report 'Ecowrap'. &quot;In recent times, there have been commentaries that have questioned whether RBI has been behind the curve in controlling inflation.  &quot;We believe RBI is much ahead of the curve in controlling inflation and the Fed can borrow a template from RBI to control US inflation that is all-pervasive and threatens to rip apart global financial stability,&quot; it said. The report has been authored by Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, State Bank of India.  The report further said there are expectations that the RBI could factor in a rate hike in August (as inflation in June is likely to come above 7 per cent) and even in October policy, and take it higher than the pre-pandemic level by October to 5.5 per cent. &quot;Our peak rate at the end of the cycle now has now a higher probability of a lower bound of 5.5 per cent and a lower probability of going up to 5.75 per cent, depending on inflation trajectory,&quot; the report said.  It, however, added that this is purely data-dependent and subject to revisions. The RBI raised the short-term lending rate by 40 basis points in May and 50 basis points in June, taking the repo rate to 4.9 per cent to tame stubbornly high inflation.  &quot;Our average inflation forecast for 2022-23 is 6.7 per cent but our quarterly inflation numbers are slightly different from RBI. &quot;The best thing is that the peak of inflation may have been reached at 7.8 per cent, with a little bit of luck,&quot; it added.  Earlier this month, the RBI revised upwards its inflation projection to 6.7 per cent for the current fiscal from its previous forecast of 5.7 per cent. The central bank expects the first quarter inflation at 7.5 per cent; the second quarter at 7.4 per cent; the third quarter at 6.2 per cent; and the fourth quarter at 5.8 per cent, with risks, evenly balanced.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/rbi-much-ahead-in-containing-inflation-sbi-report-8681211.html
SBI,2022-06-13T17:11:17+05:30,Piyush Shukla,India’s highest-paid bankers: How SBI boss Khara’s salary compares with HDFC’s Mistry and others,SBI chairman Khara received a Rs 34 lakh annual package while HDFC ‘s Mistry earned Rs 19 crore in FY22. That yawning gap epitomises the disparity between the salaries of top PSB officials and their private as well as NBFC counterparts.,"'Bankers are just like anybody else, except richer' is a famous if irreverent poem on the profession, written by the irrepressible Ogden Nash. While that title holds good in India as well, some bankers, it appears, are richer — way, way richer — than others.  Dinesh Khara would be able to testify to that.  Khara heads India’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI). He is a powerful man, overseeing assets to the tune of Rs 28.18 lakh crore and loan disbursals of over Rs 50,000 crore in a year. But Khara, who earned an annual salary of Rs 34 lakh in FY22, may not be laughing all the way to the bank. While Rs 34 lakh is a decent pay package for a government-run entity, it pales in comparison with the compensation earned by Khara’s private-sector counterparts in the business of lending. For instance, HDFC Managing Director and CEO Keki Mistry took home a gross package of Rs 19 crore in the financial year 2022. HDFC’s total assets under management (AUM) stood at Rs 6.53 crore as on March-end.  Private bank chiefs  The salaries of the top five private bank leaders, excluding ICICI Bank, ranged between 2.3 crore to Rs 7.1 crore per annum, including perks, in FY21. Private banks are yet to release their FY22 annual report. This story has used the latest numbers where available. Other numbers will be updated as they become available.  The stark difference in the annual salaries of public and private sector bank executives is due to private banks’ performance incentives being attached to their annual remuneration.  The widening divide in salary between top officials in public sector banks (PSBs) and their counterparts in private sector banks and large non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) continues to highlight the wage problem in India’s state-owned banks.  A private bank chief’s salary will be dependent on multiple factors, such as the performance of the bank, including net profit, the performance of subsidiaries, and dividends, among others. The private bank heads also have equity stock ownership plan (ESOP) perks, which are not available in PSU banks.  For example, HDFC Bank granted former MD Aditya Puri a total quantum of 406,140 employee stock options for the performance year 2019-20, basis of approval by the RBI. HDFC Bank Executive Director Kaizad Bharucha was granted a total quantum of 153,300 employee stock options for the performance year 2019-20, while Sashidhar Jagdishan, who took over as HDFC Bank MD and CEO from October 27, 2020, received a total of 260,000 employee stock options.  “The quantum of grant reported for him (Jagdishan) pertains to the grant received in his erstwhile role of Group Head of the Bank during the financial year 2020-21, prior to his appointment as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,” HDFC Bank’s FY21 annual report said.  Axis Bank MD &amp;amp; CEO Amitabh Chaudhry received a basic salary of over Rs 3.8 crore in FY21, leave fare concession facility of Rs 10 lakh, house rent allowance of Rs 1.07 crore, and perquisites, excluding ESOPs, of Rs 84 lakh, among others.  “Amitabh Chaudhry was granted 16,55,000 stock options, under the Employee Stock Option Scheme of the Bank, since 1 January 2019 being the date of his appointment as the Managing Director &amp;amp; CEO of the Bank….Further, 8,64,500 stock options remain unvested, as on 31 March 2021,” said Axis Bank’s annual report.  Kotak Mahindra Bank, on the other hand, paid Rs 1.8 crore to its Joint MD Dipak Gupta in FY21 with another Rs 1.5 crore as an annual incentive.  “For Mr Uday Kotak and Mr Dipak Gupta, the Annual Incentive includes an amount of ` 8,500,000 for FY 2018-19, approved by the RBI on 6th July 2020 and 7,000,000 for FY 2019-20, as approved by RBI on 26th March 2021,” the bank said.  IndusInd Bank MD &amp;amp; CEO Sumant Kathpalia earned Rs 1.6 crore in annual salary in FY21 and received other allowances amounting to Rs 5.4 crore.  Apart from HDFC, PSU bank heads also earn less than the chiefs of prominent NBFCs such as Bajaj Finance and Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra Finance, who paid their leaders over Rs 3.8 crore and over Rs 9 crore, respectively, in remuneration last fiscal year, excluding ESOP grants.    Size doesn't matter  Khara’s remuneration is lower than the Rs 40 lakh that his peer, Bank of Baroda MD &amp;amp; CEO Sanjiv Chadha, earned in the same period, the banks’ annual reports showed. For FY22, Chadha earned Rs 38.19 lakh as annual salary and Rs 2,27,191 in perquisites, while Khara earned Rs 27 lakh in basic pay and Rs 742,500 as dearness allowance.  On a consolidated basis, the salary of the top 5 PSU public sector bank leaders in FY22, excluding Punjab National Bank (PNB), ranged between Rs 34 lakh and Rs 40 lakh.  The salary of whole-time directors (WTD) of PSU banks and other senior officials has to be based on composite performance parameters of the individual and bank, a senior private sector bank official told Moneycontrol.  As per the RBI’s report on trends and progress of banking in India, released on December 28, the gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio of all scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) moderated to its lowest level in six years, aided by efforts towards recoveries and technical write-offs.  As of September end, the GNPAs of scheduled commercial banks fell to 6.9 percent from 7.3 percent as on March 31, 2021. Private banks’ GNPAs fell from 5.5 percent in FY20 to 4.9 percent in FY21, while PSU banks’ GNPAs reduced to 9.1 percent in FY21 versus 10.3 percent a year ago.  “Asset quality improved, partly attributable to imposition of the asset classification standstill. Public sector banks (PSBs) reported net profits after a gap of five years. More generally, the capital position of banks improved, aided by recapitalisation by the government as well as raising of funds from the market,” the RBI said.  Apart from most PSBs posting profits in FY22 on an individual basis, SBI’s standalone net profit rose 55% in FY22 over the previous year to Rs 31,676 crore, on the back of stable net interest income and controlled slippages.  “During FY22, your Bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPA) came down by Rs 14,366 crore to Rs 1,12,023 crore. Recoveries and upgradation during the year increased by 21.58% to Rs 21,437 crore. Consequently, the gross NPA ratio of the Bank improved by 101 bps from 4.98% in March 2021. The net NPA of the Bank also improved to 1.02% as of March 2022,” SBI’s annual report said.  “The talent crunch (at PSU banks) can be solved if the Board is also permitted to recruit wholetime directors (WTDs) from the market. Today, these are selected only from public sector banks,” the official said.  “The RBI has issued detailed guidelines for computation of the compensation for wholetime directors of private sector Banks, which include the fixed and variable portion of the compensation. The variable portion also includes ESOPs and cash incentives and the same guidelines should be made applicable for the compensation of WTDs of PSBs too,” the official added.  A senior union leader, however, had a different view on the subject.  “Private banks’ motive is to make a profit, while PSBs’ objective is broad-based economic development and making banking credit and services accessible to all, at affordable prices,” said CH Venkatachalam, General Secretary,  All India Bank Employees Association.  There is more security in a PSU bank role but the need for a pay hike is being felt of late as the top job has become stressful now, especially in the face of heightened competition, he added.

SBI,2022-06-12T06:38:18+05:30,Bloomberg,SBI chairman bullish on economic recovery as loan demand rebounds,"Companies are steadily drawing down from a $71-billion loan pipeline, Dinesh Kumar Khara, chairman of State Bank of India, says. Loan growth at the 216-year-old lender is expected to be robust, underpinned by demand from businesses after two straight years of credit contraction","Consumer cutbacks due to raging inflation and higher borrowing costs are failing to dent investment plans at Indian businesses tapping the country’s biggest lender, a sign that a recovery in Asia’s third-largest economy is gathering pace.  Companies are steadily drawing down from a $71 billion loan pipeline, Dinesh Kumar Khara, chairman of State Bank of India, told Bloomberg News in an interview at his Mumbai office. Loan growth at the 216-year-old lender, a banker to one out of every three Indians, is expected to be robust, underpinned by demand from businesses after two straight years of credit contraction, Khara said.  That broadly mirrors a trend where loan growth in India’s Rs 120 trillion ($1.5 trillion) banking system is expanding annually at its fastest pace in three years. While part of the credit demand is to cover rising costs, the rest is going into business expansion and investments for capacity addition.  “Whether it is working capital loans or term loans, the draw downs have been rising, and the ratio of pipeline to loan book narrowed by at least six percentage points in recent months,” Khara said. “Capacity utilization at several sectors like iron and steel is full, and if we get a good monsoon too this year, things will get way better.”  The rise in business confidence and credit demand in India comes despite rising cost of funds. On Wednesday, the central bank’s rate-setting panel raised the key interest rate for a second straight month to tame inflationary pressures with policymakers pledging to withdraw the pandemic-era monetary stimulus in coming months.  The rising demand for loans means SBI will have to shore up its capital adequacy ratio, since it is hovering at less than two percentage points over the minimum regulatory requirement. The bank’s overall capital buffer of 13.8% is the lowest among the top lenders in the country.  &amp;nbsp; Funding Growth SBI will be aiming to sell bonds to augment its capital base, Khara said. The lender sold so-called Tier 1 bonds, which can be fully written down in a crisis, in December at the lowest coupon among Indian banks after the country started implementing the stringent Basel III capital rules in 2013.  With Khara at the helm over the last 21 months, SBI shares have surged about 150%, making it the best performer on the 10-member BSE Bankex index for the period. The 61-year-old banker, the son of a Reserve Bank of India official, started working at the lender in 1984 and made his way to up become chairman in October 2020.  A challenge for Khara is the drop in investment profits at the lender as rallying yields erode prices of debt holdings. SBI held government securities -- including federal and state securities -- worth about 7 trillion rupees as of March 31, exchange filings show.  The higher returns on certain debt securities, including those of state governments, will soften the blow to the bank’s treasury earning, Khara said. As a portion of the overall assets, the debt securities holdings will also decrease as the credit growth outpace deposits.  A customer talks on his phone as he exits a State Bank of India (SBI) branch in Patna, Bihar, India, on Friday, Feb. 26, 2021. After falling into a coronavirus-fueled recession in the third quarter, India's economy has likely returned to expansion in the three months ended December, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Pushing Digital Khara, who took to banking straight after college, considers the thrust on digital initiatives by the lender as his major achievement. The pace at which the bank’s 467 million customers are adopting its mobile banking app -- Yono or You Only Need One -- is several times higher than the pace at which they embraced digital banking years back, he said.However, the lender has no plans for acquisitions to build its digital banking prowess, the banker who oversaw the mergers of 10 banks into SBI, said. It also shelved earlier discussions to carve out its digital app and instead ramped up investments into it.“The plan is to grow in a profitable way. We have been on an upward move in most operational metrics in recent years, which we hope to sustain,” Khara said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/banker-to-467-million-indians-says-loan-demand-is-bouncing-back-8673961.html

Khara joined SBI as a probationary officer in 1984 and took over as the bank Chairman in October 2020. He previously served as MD of the bank in charge of global banking and SBI subsidiaries, among others.  Former SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar received a total of Rs 30.34 lakh from the bank of which Rs 14.04 lakh was in form of leave encashment paid on retirement in October 2020.  For FY22, SBI Chairman Khara earned Rs 27 lakh in basic pay and Rs 742,500 as dearness allowance. Of the total Rs 38.12 lakh SBI Chairman earned in FY21, Rs 400,000 were in form of incentives.  In comparison, Canara Bank MD and Chief Executive Officer (MD &amp;amp; CEO) LV Prabhakar drew Rs 36.89 lakh annual salary in FY22, while Bank of Baroda paid a remuneration of Rs 40.46 lakh to its MD &amp;amp; CEO Sanjiv Chadha during the same period.  SBI engaged an external consulting company in FY22 which assisted the bank in laying down parameters for performance evaluation of Directors, Chairman, Board Level Committees, and Central Board as a whole and also assisted in facilitating the overall evaluation process, the report said.  “The evaluation process has validated the Board of Directors’ confidence in the governance values of the Bank, the synergy that exists amongst the Board of Directors, and the collaboration between the Chairman, the Board, and the Management,” it added.  In accordance with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Central government directions in 2019, SBI has formed a nomination and remuneration committee (NRC) led by Chairman  B Venugopal to conduct due diligence and arrive at the ‘fit and proper’ status of candidates filing nominations for election as Directors by shareholders, the annual report said, adding that during FY 2022, the NRC met once.  Further, SBI offers compensation of Rs 70,000 as ‘sitting fees’ for the Non-Executive Director attending the Meetings of the Central Board and Rs 30,000 for attending the meetings of other Board level Committees.    Private banks  The annual compensation granted by the central government to public sector banks is significantly lower compared to how much private bank leaders make in a year.  For example, during FY21, HDFC Bank MD &amp;amp; CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan drew Rs 4.77 crore in annual salary, while Axis Bank MD Amitabh Chaudhry drew upwards of Rs 6 crore during the same period.  ICICI Bank MD &amp;amp; CEO Sandeep Bakhshi voluntarily relinquished his fixed compensation of basic, supplementary allowances and retirals for fiscal 2021 in view of COVID-19 related impact on the bank and was paid an honorarium fee of Re 1.  The pay gap between private and public sector banks' heads has been a long-standing issue that needs a solution in order to attract top talent, bankers said. The salary of a private bank leadership team is competitive due to better employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs).  “The respective banks’ boards must be authorised to decide compensation based on composite performance parameters of the individual and the Bank,” a senior banker with a private sector bank said.  “The talent crunch can be solved if the Board is also permitted to recruit Whole time directors from the market.

In the face of the heightened inflation situation – the headline number touched nearly 7.8 per cent for April, and the RBI is set to hike rates by another 0.75 per cent to get the repo rate back to the pre-pandemic level of 5.15 per cent, they added.  The economists said they did a study of the Russian invasion's impact on inflation, which revealed that 59 per cent of the jump in prices is due to geopolitical events.  Using February as the base case, the study revealed that because of war alone, food and beverages, fuel, light and transport contributed 52 per cent of the increase, while another 7 per cent impact came from the jump in input prices for the FMCG sector.  Stating that the inflation is unlikely to correct anytime soon, the note said there is a difference between rural and urban areas when it comes to price rises. The former are impacted more by higher food price pressures, while the latter are showing more impact because of the fuel price hikes.  &quot;Against the continued increase in inflation, it is now almost certain that RBI will raise rates in forthcoming June and August policy and will take it to the pre-pandemic level of 5.15 per cent by August,&quot; it said, adding that the biggest question for the central bank to ponder is whether inflation will tread down meaningfully because of such rate hikes if war-related disruptions do not subside quickly.  It also needs to check if growth could be a large casualty in case of large and persistent rate increases, even as inflation prints will continue to be of serious concern, the note added.  Backing the RBI in its moves to quell inflation by rate hikes, the economists said there can also be a positive impact of the hikes.  &quot;A higher interest rate will be also positive for the financial system as risks will get repriced,&quot; it said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-may-hike-rates-by-75-bps-by-august-say-sbi-economists-8518081.html

The lending rate revision by SBI (State Bank of India) is likely to be followed by other banks in the days to come.,"The country's largest lender State Bank of India has raised its marginal cost of funds based lending rate by 10 basis points or 0.1 per cent across all tenures, a move that will lead to an increase in EMIs for borrowers. This is the second hike in a month raising the cost by 0.2 per cent with the two consecutive increases.  The revision follows an off-cycle rate increase by the Reserve Bank earlier this month.

SBI,2022-05-16T08:36:16+05:30,Siddhi Nayak,Rising interest rates to positively impact net interest margin: SBI chairman,"Also, why Dinesh Kumar Khara sees inflation as positive to some extent for economy, and more","In an interaction on May 13, State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara spoke about how the country's largest lender perceives potential interest rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and loan growth and asset quality going forward.   SBI reported a 41 percent surge in net profit for January-March to Rs 9,114 crore on a yearly basis due to decline in bad loans. The bank said that provisions for bad loans came down to nearly a third of the year ago level. Over the quarters, like most lenders, SBI has focused on building a safe retail loan book to protect the quality of its assets during the pandemic. Its non-performing asset ratios have also improved in recent quarters.  In the interview below, Khara speaks about the bank being in a position to achieve the target of 15 percent return on equity before 2024.  Edited excerpts:  What is the outlook on net interest margin?  About 75 percent of the book is linked to either MCLR (marginal cost of fund-based lending rate) or EBLR (external benchmark lending rate) or treasury bill. In such a scenario, when the interest rates are on the rise, we have the advantage because the loans are getting repriced from time to time, but when it comes to deposits, they always go up with a lag. So, I think I expect that it should have a positive impact going forward as far as the NIMs (net interest margin) of the bank are concerned.   Considering that a large part of the banking system loan is repo-linked, do you feel that there will be more pressure on the retail segment given that the rate cycle is turning?  When it comes to personal loans, the yardstick for us is the EMI (equated monthly instalment) to NMI (net monthly income) ratio. Suppose the interest rates go up, and the salaries are also likely to be pre-COVID level: In such a situation, the EMI-to-NMI ratio is going to the advantage of the customer.  How concerning is inflation right now?  I think for an economy like ours, which is actually a developing economy, inflation is positive to some extent. Because in these inflationary conditions, if you leverage, it is to the advantage of the customer, both corporate and retail.   Optically when the repo rate goes up 40 basis points, it gives an impression that probably it's a shock. But when you look into the overall context, it may not be.  Your return on equity (RoE) is currently 13.92 percent. By when will your target of 15 percent be met?  We had set a target by the year 2024. Currently, we have witnessed about 398 basis point improvement in a year. That gives us the confidence that we should achieve the aim much before the targeted date.  What is your guidance on loan growth?  Normally, we don't give any kind of future scenario outlook. But nevertheless, with the kind of trend I have seen till now in the current year, we are seeing that our loan book is growing faster than deposits. So I think that is something which gives me confidence that we should continue to see the kind of loan growth that you've seen in the past, both in retail as well as the corporate side.  Can you give us some details of where the corporate loan growth is coming from?  As far as the corporate loan book is concerned, most of the growth is related to infrastructure which is not reflected till now. We have also got an un-utilised working facility, which is about Rs 2 lakh crore. There is about Rs 4.60 lakh crore worth of proposals in the corporate space. We strongly believe that corporate credit growth will have a good climate.   How will corporate loans be priced?   The pricing is also a function of the liquidity in the system. So the recent attempt of RBI to increase the repo also means it will be sucking out about Rs 87,000 crore excess liquidity. So I think, as the liquidity gets rebalanced in the system, perhaps the pressure on the loan for the banks may not be as high. So I think perhaps it will lead to some kind of a readjustment in terms of pricing. The corporate loans will be rightly priced.  How do you expect retail loan demand to pan out in the current scenario?  The willingness of the retail borrowers will depend upon their NMI. If at all, they have felt the need for a house, they will certainly go for the mortgage, or for that matter, any personal loan. We are not seeing a demand issue.  Do you foresee any issue on re-payment of existing loans?  In terms of payment of existing loans, I don't think we have any concern. Obviously, we'll have to wait and watch what kind of investments will happen as we go forward if the lower rate of interest obviously has driven the home sales, right? So I think it's appropriate to wait for a couple of quarters and see how it plays out.  Any consideration on increasing the savings account interest rate?  The ALCO (assets and liabilities committee) is yet to decide on this.   How much is the restructured book?  I think as far as our restructured book is concerned it is about Rs 30,000 crore which is actually less than 1.1 percent of our total loan book. Even for that we have adequate provisions. In fact, I would like to mention that in our provisions you will see a number which is almost about Rs 7,900 crore, which was earlier the COVID-related provision. Now we have kept this provision for the restructured book.   Any signs of stress in the restructured book?  The restructured book is behaving pretty well. We have seen a situation where people have started repaying.  Does that mean you will stick to your guidance of keeping slippages below two percent of the total book?  We should be in a position to maintain that. Slippages will be in check.  Stress in agriculture loans continues to remain slightly elevated. Why is that?  Part of it is also attributed to the macroeconomy and most of it to the rural stress. Hopefully with better monsoons this year, we should see an improvement in the recovery climate.   It appears you are bullish on co-lending in the agriculture sector…  We are getting into the co-lending kind of an arrangement in the agriculture and SME space (small and medium enterprises). We have seen that co-lending partners have got much better experience in terms of the quality of the book, and we will be riding on that. We expect that our agri portfolio should also improve.  What is the update on the National Asset Reconstruction Company? By when will it start taking bad assets?  We expect that it should happen soon.  We understand that there were some vacancies to be filled in the company.  They have already been filled. Some of them will require regulatory approval before being onboarded. Those are expected to come in the next few weeks.  What is your exposure to Future Group and Srei Group?  I normally don't discuss any account in particular, but I will just say that both these accounts are fully provided for in the books.  Any plans to upgrade YONO?  A request for proposal has been floated. The teams are already working on it.   Is there a plan to make YONO a digital bank?  We have no such plan. We will rather like to build the muscle in the bank, and create value for all our stakeholders, including customers.  Any plans to monetise your subsidiaries?  We have to be very mindful of market realities. We have nurtured the subsidiaries well, and would like to take them to the market route at the appropriate time.  Has there been any impact on your overseas exposure because of the Russia-Ukraine crisis?  As far as our international operations are concerned, our presence in Russia is through a subsidiary. But it's a very small amount as compared to our overseas balance sheet. I don't think it will have any impact as far as our international operations are concerned.  What is your exposure to Sri Lanka?  Whatever exposure we have to Sri Lanka, it is all guaranteed by the government of India.  There was a recent loan offer SBI gave its employees for the LIC IPO. What kind of traction have you seen there?  I think the numbers are still to be compiled. But I think broadly, whoever wanted the loan got it. I think it is also important that employees had adequate funding.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/interview/state-bank-of-india-chairman-on-why-he-sees-inflation-as-positive-to-some-extent-for-economy-and-more-8511701.html

According to a report in The Hindu, the unnamed SBI employee’s copy-paste mistake saw funds for the Dalit Bandhu scheme being accidentally deposited into the accounts of 15 employees of Lotus Hospitals.  Each Lotus Hospitals employee received Rs 10 lakh in their salary account. The funds were meant for the Telangana government’s Dalit Bandhu welfare scheme.  The Saifabad police in Hyderabad said that an employee of the SBI Rangareddy District Collectorate branch accidentally transferred Rs 1.50 crore to the wrong accounts on April 24.  Of the 15 people who received Rs 10 lakh in their accounts, 14 returned the money while one person, a lab technician named Mahesh, failed to send it back.  “Soon after realising the mistake, the bank officials called the employees and asked them to transfer back the amount. While 14 employees reverted the money, lab technician Mahesh failed to send back the money, as he was not available over phone,” a senior official was quoted as saying by The Hindu.  Mahesh wrongly assumed that Rs 10 lakh had been deposited in his account under some government scheme and used some of the money to clear previous debts. “Despite repeated requests, he was not returning the money. As a result, on Wednesday, the bank official lodged a complaint, and a case under Section 403 of IPC was registered against Mahesh,” the officer said.  Ironically, while Saifabad police registered a case against the accidental beneficiary, no case was registered against the SBI employee whose mistake led to the whole confusion.  Mahesh has returned Rs 6.70 lakh but still owes the bank Rs 3.30 lakh.  “A copy-paste error by the bank employee has led to such a big fuss,” the officer added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/sbi-employees-copy-paste-error-leads-to-rs-1-5-crore-being-transferred-to-wrong-accounts-8506471.html

The bank’s restructuring book, which is 1.1 percent of the total book, is also behaving well, Khara said. SBI is “not expecting any surprises” from non-performing assets.  In terms of the bank’s margins, the gradual rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India will have a positive impact, the chairman said.  “We have got the advantage because loans are getting repriced, but deposits, they go up with a lag, Khara said. “I expect that it should have a positive impact on the margins of the bank going forward, he added.  SBI also aims to maintain the current credit growth even in the next financial year, Khara said.

The bank also has no plans to make YONO, it mobile banking application, into a digital entity.  “We would rather like to build the muscle in the bank and create value for all our stakeholders, including customers and stakeholders,” Khara said.  SBI will be also mindful of market realities before monetising stake in its subsidiaries, Khara said, adding that it will take it to the market at the right time.  Khara also said the National Asset Reconstruction Company will start taking bad assets “soon.”  To supplement this, Managing Director Swaminathan J said that the process of identification of bad accounts and due diligence is almost done.  “It is in the final stage of getting all approvals ready in terms of making binding offers to banks. We are probably a couple of weeks away from that,” Swaminathan said.

The revised interest rates on bulk term deposits amounting to Rs 2 crore and above are effective from Tuesday, the bank said.  While interest rate on deposits maturing between 7 days and 45 days has been kept unchanged at 3 per cent, those maturing between 46 and 179 days will now attract an interest rate of 3.50 per cent as against 3 per cent earlier.

For deposits having 2 years to less than 3 years maturity period, the rate has been hiked by 65 bps to 4.25 per cent.  The interest rate on bulk term deposits for 3 years and up to 10 years has been increased by 90 basis points to 4.50 per cent as against 3.60 per cent.

The hike in deposit rates by the banks came after a surprise 40 basis points increase in repo rate to 4.40 per cent on May 4 by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  A hike in repo rate by RBI gives banks scope to increase their deposit rates, which in turn provides depositors an opportunity to earn higher interest on their funds parked with banks.

Meanwhile, Bajaj Finance, the lending and investing arm of Bajaj Finserv, on Tuesday said it has increased the interest rates on fixed deposits by up to 10 basis points for tenor between 36 and 60 months.  The revised rates on FDs (fixed deposits) of up to Rs 5 crore are effective from May 10, 2022, and shall be applicable to fresh deposits and renewals of maturing deposits, the company said in a release.  Post the revision, deposits for the period of 36 months to 60 months will offer a cumulative return as high as 7 per cent.  Senior citizens can reap the benefit of up to 0.25 per cent higher FD rates, which will offer assured returns of 7.45 per cent for 44 months, the release said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-hikes-interest-rates-on-bulk-term-deposits-by-40-90-basis-points-8484071.html

Last week, the HC had pulled up the country’s largest public sector lender for not issuing a no-dues certificate, observing this was nothing but harassment.  On Monday, the bank, in an affidavit filed before the court of Justice Bhargav Karia, said it has issued the no-dues certificate on April 28 to the borrower, required for clearing the land deal.  Justice Karia said in his order that with the issuance of the no-dues certificate, the petitioner has sought permission to withdraw the plea.  The SBI said it could not issue the no-dues certificate earlier in view of a letter received from the original borrower directing it not to do so.  &quot;It was not the endeavour of the respondent bank to not issue no-dues certificate in spite of payment of the entire dues,” the SBI told the court.  The court had last Wednesday pulled up the bank for not issuing no-dues certificate over an outstanding amount of just 31 paise.  Petitioners Rakesh Verma and Manoj Verma had purchased a piece of land in Khoraj village near Ahmedabad city from farmer Shamjibhai and his family in 2020.  Since Shamjibhai had sold the land to the petitioners before repaying a crop loan of Rs 3 lakh taken from the SBI, the petitioners (who are new owners of the land) could not enter their names in the revenue records because of the bank’s charge on the land parcel.  Though the farmer later repaid the entire amount to the bank, the SBI did not issue a no-dues certificate, following which the new owners moved the high court two years ago.  During the hearing last week, when Justice Karia had asked the bank to submit the no-dues certificate in the court, SBI’s lawyer Anand Gogia said, &quot;It’s not possible because there is an outstanding amount of 31 paise. It is system generated.&quot;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/after-rap-from-gujarat-hc-sbi-issues-no-dues-certificate-withheld-over-farmers-outstanding-amount-of-31-paise-8443091.html

Touted as the UPI moment for lending, the AA framework ensures swift data sharing with the consent of the user and eliminates the need for physical documents.  Since it went live in September 2021, 332,000 customer accounts have been linked and over 310,000 consent requests have been fulfilled.  The framework facilitates sharing of financial information on a real-time basis between regulated entities. AAs are licensed by the Reserve Bank of India to enable the flow of data between Financial Information Providers (FIPs) and Financial Information Users (FIUs).  FIPs are institutions that hold customer data and FIUs are entities that consume data to offer better service, underwrite loans, and so on. Banks and other financial institutions must become FIPs to be able to also become users of data from other financial institutions.  An AA is data blind and only receives encrypted data which is decrypted only by the FIU.  Union Bank of India has said that it will work both as an FIU and FIP to allow its customers to share data digitally on a real-time basis.  Major private sector banks like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are already live as FIPs and FIUs. There are 34 banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and other institutions so far live on AA, including Federal Bank, IDFC First Bank and IndusInd Bank.  Moneycontrol had reported on January 17 that the next step for the ecosystem is to grow the number of FIPs and get more banks to go live, mainly the State Bank of India (SBI) which has the largest share of accounts in India.  As per information on the website of Sahamati, a not-for-profit self-organised collective for the AA ecosystem, SBI is in the testing mode.  The ecosystem is also working on linking accounts of Small and Medium Enterprises as only individual current and savings accounts are linked currently. Insurers are working on integrating too and the next step will be to get mutual funds on board.  CAMS, FinVu, NADL and OneMoney have launched AA app and website interfaces for customers to use.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/announcements/union-bank-becomes-first-public-sector-bank-to-go-live-on-account-aggregator-framework-8434251.html
SBI,2022-04-19T11:55:08+05:30,Moneycontrol News,SBI hikes lending rate by 0.1%; EMIs to go up,The lending rate revision by SBI is likely to be followed by other banks in the days to come.,"The country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has raised its marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points (bps) or 0.1 per cent across all tenures, a move that will lead to an increase in EMIs for borrowers. The lending rate revision by SBI is likely to be followed by other banks in the days to come.  With the increase, EMIs will go up for those borrowers who have availed loans on MCLR, not for those, whose loans are linked to other benchmarks. SBI's EBLR rate is 6.65 per cent, while the repo-linked lending rate (RLLR) is 6.25 effective April 1.  Banks add Credit Risk Premium (CRP) over the EBLR and RLLR while giving any kind of loan including housing and auto loans. The revised MCLR rate is effective from April 15, as per the information posted on SBI website.  With the revision, one-year MCLR has increased to 7.10 per cent, from the earlier 7 per cent. An overnight, one-month and three-month MCLR rose by 10 bps to 6.75 per cent, whereas a six-month MCLR increased to 7.05 per cent.  Most of the loans are linked to the one-year MCLR rate. At the same time, two-year MCLR increased by 0.1 per cent to 7.30 per cent, while three-year MCLR rose to 7.40 per cent.  From October 1, 2019, all banks including SBI have to lend only at an interest rate linked to an external benchmark such as RBI's repo rate or Treasury Bill yield. As a result, monetary policy transmission by banks has gained traction. The impact of the introduction of external benchmark-based pricing of loans on monetary transmission has been felt across various sectors, encompassing even those sectors that are not directly linked to external benchmark-based loan pricing.  &quot;Looking ahead, the proportion of loans linked to external benchmarks is expected to increase further along with a commensurate fall in the internal benchmark linked loans. Coupled with shorter reset periods, monetary transmission to banks' interest rates can, thus, be expected to strengthen further, a recently released article by RBI said.

This is the internal reference rate based on which rates are set for various types of loans,"State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, increased its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points across tenors, effective April 15.  The overnight, one-month and three-month MCLRs have been hiked to 6.75 percent each from 6.65 percent earlier, according to SBI’s website.  The one-year MCLR currently stands at 7.10 percent from 7 percent earlier. The six-month MCLR is now 7.05 percent from 6.95 percent previously.  The two-year and three-year MCLRs have been hiked 10 bps each to 7.30 percent and 7.40 percent, respectively.  Also, private sector lender Axis Bank has hiked MCLR by 5 bps across tenures effective today, April 18.  MCLR is an internal reference rate for banks set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to help define the minimum interest rate on various types of loans, including home loans.  The RBI’s repo rate has been kept unchanged at 4 percent since May 2020. That’s the rate at which the central bank lends short-term funds to banks.  Retail inflation in India jumped to a 17-month high of 6.95 percent in March from 6.07 percent in February, driven by high food prices. If inflation concerns persist and there are no shocks to growth, interest rates will likely be hiked later this year, analysts said.

Corporates are applying for credit but they are not fully utilising their sanctioned loan limit","State Bank of India Chairman Dinesh Khara on April 13 said the bank may post over 10 percent credit growth in FY22 and that the credit offtake is likely going to be higher next year.  “Going forward, as of now, we are seeing some kind of a better capacity utilisation in terms of the working capital utilisation and term-loan offtake. This is a trend we observed towards the end of the last quarter (Q4FY22) and also it is likely to persist going forward,” Khara said in an interaction with CNBC TV-18.  Khara said sectors that have seen a spurt in credit offtake are essentially from the core sector, which includes iron and steel and cement. Some capital expenditure is also seen in automobile and e-mobility sector. Infrastructure projects are also driving credit demand in airport and port sector, he said.  Though there has been a rise in credit offtake, there exists a lag between sanctions and disbursals. Corporates are applying for credit but they are not fully utilising their sanctioned loan limit.  Asked whether the merger between Housing Development Finance Corp and HDFC Bank challenge SBI’s market share in the home loan segment, Khara said the bank will be “more than happy” to rejig its products and platform to capture demand.  “I always feel that competition brings more and more agility. I think being the largest home loan provider, that is a trigger for us to ensure that we should stay largest ever. So for that whatever is required to be done, we will be more than happy looking into our product and platform,” he said.  The chief of the country's largest lender does not foresee more than 1 percent rise in interest rates on home loans this fiscal. The rates are now linked to the repo rate, but underwriting of new home loans will be based on whether the liquidity stays in surplus mode.  &quot;We had last quarter itself started increasing our term deposit interest rate.

SBI,2022-04-05T17:50:33+05:30,Asha Menon," Russia-Ukraine conflict: The deeper the sanctions, the more the opportunities that will open up for India:...","The stand-off between Russia and the western countries opens up various export opportunities for India, and the real possibility of an alternative oil-supply chain, said SBI's Group Chief Economic Advisor","The Russia-Ukraine conflict is rapidly dividing the world into two camps. But India has so far managed to retain its stand– of neutrality–which serves its political and economic interests. There have been concerns that India’s stand may invite western nations’ displeasure, but SBI’s Group Chief Economic Advisor Soumya Kanti Ghosh has a different take. In an interview with Moneycontrol, he explained why he sees a new world order taking shape and how India can collaborate with Russia to benefit from it. The interview reflects his personal views. You have said that Indian exporters could benefit from the standoff between Russia and the western economies. Which sectors in particular could benefit and how?  While the Indian exports to Russia in terms of quantitative scale have not been worth much (as discussed in our report), there would be great scope of increased exports in traditionally traded items such as pharmaceuticals, tea, rice, and in new areas such as medical devices, software/hardware, transport, machinery, mobile and telecom devices, chemicals, textiles/clothing and apparels, leather, ceramics and agriculture inputs. India is already working on ‘Sangam’, a key policy initiative in exports to Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. Russia’s ‘disconnect’ from other trading partners should create a void, which India would be able to fill… without risking being labelled an outlier by the west. The rapidly unfolding events make it difficult to predict a timeline over which this shift in trade relations will happen, but the time taken should be inversely co-related with impact of sanctions. The deeper the sanctions go, the more the opportunities that will open up for India (though, reduced purchasing power may curtail non-essential buying greatly). The two countries had planned to touch $30 billion trade by 2025, but the current scenario should get us to that target much before. Also read: The war an opportunity for rupee's internationalisation: Ghosh Like you have said, Russia is likely to swing towards China. It seems inevitable that this would happen. How can India present itself as a stronger economic ally to Russia?  The hob-nobbing between Russia and China seems more towards giving the west a fitting reply that it should stop policing the new world order, as digital architectures are changing the contours of trades. This has made the world truly flatter, opening new lines of trouble-free communication across geographies. This posturing suits China, which has been short charged in the recent past, for example, with the banning of Tik-Tok and Huawei/other telecom firms. Also, two years of Covid-19-led disturbance has caused mistrust to build in the western economies, and they are being forced to reconsider their huge imports from the mainland and (diversify) at the first chance. Given all this and India’s growing global acceptability, the dominance of the Indian diaspora in circles of influence worldwide and the maturity shown by the political leadership here, Russia will need to adopt a balanced approach with China. Russia will need to give enough elbow room to India, its tried and tested partner of decades, with non-binding terms and zero baggage.  Also, China does not seem to be dictating terms to Russia and its allies on what moves they should make in the current gameplan. Also China would not want to appear as involved in the current turmoil since its exports to the world are already under threat from other Asian powers. Which sectors in India will benefit from allowing Russian investments in the corporate debt market?  The discussions around allowing Russian investments in India’s corporate debt markets are nothing new, since the two countries have already set goals of reaching bilateral investments of $50 billion by the year 2025. In the current arrangement, the Russian side should be given a choice to invest in bonds of better-rated corporations first, without much stress on sector specific allocations. With the earlier Rupee-Ruble (R/R) arrangement falling apart from the huge trade imbalance, what makes you optimistic about a similar arrangement this time--of participating in each other's debt markets through the local currency?  The earlier R/R arrangement, in all probability, was propagated at one of the most inopportune moments, with erstwhile USSR’s experiments with Glasnost and Perestroika having gone awfully wrong while India’s own BoP nightmares made the exercise utterly meaningless. In 2022, the economic realities have changed–countries are facing different kinds of economic challenges and aggressions. For example, currency wars are taking a new shape, with the onslaught of digital currencies and central banks’ hurried responses in propagating CBDCs to check this tornado. In this new reality, the R/R arrangement should work well for India and Russia in settling (bilateral netting would be preferred) the imports and exports in select domains such as defence, energy, food grains calibrated and stabilised as we reach the bridge. As of now, the investments are being proposed in Indian Corporate markets. Indian investors, who have diverse global portfolio allocations, may not be as interested to shop around the red square since they would be worried about the US actions. If the war prolongs and there is further isolation of Russia, will the alternate payment system set up by RBI and VEB be sustainable? Will Indian banks face sanctions?  Going by the payment and settlement structure, the final arrangement is between the two central banks (RBI and VEB (SDC)). Individual banks have been kept out, to protect them. We think the mechanism devised will work well. It involves individual customers raising invoices and receiving payments in their designated bank accounts, through mirror accounts maintained by respective banks, at the central banks. Since the mechanism is between two central banks, the chances of individual banks inviting sanctions seem far-fetched. What are the risks of increasing exposure to the Russian economy, when India is dealing with a rising inflation?  The pricing of the Ural oil, at a hefty discount from pre war price levels, will help in the government’s efforts to not front load the spiralling prices to common people. India acting to secure some energy security, even while opening two-way channels of economic co-operation, should actually reduce the inflationary pressures through new opportunities. If India deepens its ties with Russia and upsets the US, won't it be risking its $170+ billion (FY22, April-Dec) software exports?  Henry Kissinger, the celebrated US diplomat, credited with shaping the US foreign policy, in particular with its Asian counterparts in the seventies, once famously quipped that it was the economic interests that decided America’s friendships. The US needs India more than others to balance the power in the resurgent Asian peninsula. The US’s interests are served well by India’s lucrative, upwardly mobile markets, and its fiercely independent tech behemoths are linked strongly to Indian software/hardware supply and human capital. Therefore, it is nearly impossible for India’s software industry to face any headwinds through India’s tilt towards Russia. Also read: The world can't break its oil habit  Since Russian oil only accounts for 2-3% of India's oil imports currently, can India realistically depend heavily on Russia for its energy needs? Won’t recalibrating supply chains and refining technologies be time consuming, and extremely difficult during a conflict situation?  The recent announcements from MEA and the Indian embassy / Consulates in Russia give an insight into India’s efforts to build an alternate supply chain, capable of handling additional imports from the Russian side, should the math work out profitably for us. There have been hectic parleys and meetings between the oil majors from both sides. The shipping contract stipulates that it would be the responsibility of the exporter to reach the crude at designated Indian ports, thereby eliminating any high seas risk of embargoes affecting the Indian side. So, practically Indian oil majors have little worries on the transport part, or associated costs since it would be borne by Russian majors. Ural oil definitely has a little complex constitution (compared to Brent) but given the technical wherewithal of our refiners, a little tweak in system should take care of cracking complexities at upstream and downstream points.

","India’s largest housing finance company, HDFC Ltd, and India’s largest private sector bank, HDFC Bank, have announced plans for a transformational merger that will create a financial services behemoth with mouth-watering prospects for synergies, cross-selling, and value unlocking for shareholders. This will result in the creation of India’s third-largest listed firm and the markets gave a thumbs up to the move with shares of both firms surging during days trade on April 4.  Veteran banker and HDFC Ltd Chairman Deepak Parekh summed up the deal aptly when he said, “ After 45 years in housing finance and after providing 9 million homes to Indians, we have to find a home for ourselves. And we have found a home in our own family company, HDFC Bank”  But what’s India Inc’s take on this mega-deal which has sent ripples through the industry?  Moneycontrol’s Ashwin Mohan spoke to a cross-section of senior industry executives who weighed in with their views –  Ajay Piramal, chairman of  Piramal Group which is present in the financial services segment told Moneycontrol, “ I think this is a tremendous event and a really nice culmination of the contribution that Mr Deepak Parekh has made to the Indian financial services industry. I give him full credit for creating the finest financial services institution, whether it's a bank, NBFC, or an insurance company. I am delighted and was waiting for this day and it has come. This feat by Mr. Parekh reminds me of Dhoni's match-winning six in the 2011 World Cup&quot;.  The head honcho of another diversified conglomerate Harsh Goenka, Chairman, RPG Enterprises called it a “watershed moment” for India’s financial sector. He elaborated, “ The merger has a very strong rationale that includes a mammoth balance sheet which should make cost of funds competitive, significant potential for synergies and a global scale of operations. It’s a win-win for all stakeholders. Ek aur ek gyarah.”  “This should have happened earlier, but better late than never, “ says former Sebi chairman M Damodaran who has founded Excellence Enablers, corporate governance think tank. He believes the proposed merger of these two large entities should be positive for all stakeholders  Veteran investment banker and chairman of DSP Group Hemendra Kothari who is Deepak Parekh’s junior from Sydenham College, Mumbai feels Parekh, the “godfather” of the group and the person behind its meteoric rise over the past few decades will be missed for his experience and astute business sense.  The deal is expected to take around 15 to 18 months to complete and RBI norms do not allow anyone above 75 years to be on the board of a bank. Parekh has already crossed that age. Atanu Chakroborty, the current chairman of HDFC Bank is expected to chair the combined entity with HDFC Bank CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan in the corner office.  “ The ratings of the institution will improve and on the distribution side, HDFC Ltd will be much stronger than before ( especially for their insurance vertical),” Kothari added  Speaking about the merger benefits for both the firms, Pramod Kumar, Managing Director &amp;amp; Head of Banking, Barclays India said, “For the bank, it completes its suite of products including having mortgage assets on its own books. To HDFC, the bank can provide even lower-cost funding to the mortgage business. Even though HDFC was always borrowing at very fine rates on its own strengths but still bank deposits can be cheaper than that. Besides, it gives HDFC shareholders an additional opportunity to grow beyond just mortgage and own a much more diversified mix of businesses.”  Addressing some of the key challenges, Kumar added, “ There are some obvious issues to address like Debentures, ECBs, SLR and CRR as well as ownership stakes into several investments that HDFC has in the asset management, life and non-life insurance businesses, which I am sure RBI would need to look into. What we might miss is the HDFC DNA of spawning new and very successful businesses that have created huge value in the past but hopefully, the bank will be able to preserve and nurture that !”  Private equity veteran and ex Citi India CEO Sanjay Nayar feels the mega transaction makes a lot of strategic sense for both the organisations as well as their respective customers. “ There is a clear impetus for the mortgage business on a combined basis. This is a complex deal subject to regulatory approvals and there could be challenges in execution but I am sure they must have proactively addressed those.”  In response to a query on whether the transaction would trigger consolidation in the banking sector, former SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar who is an advisor to Baring Private Equity Asia and Kotak Investment Advisors told CNBC TV-18, “It may trigger the desire to consolidate amongst private sector banks, don’t see the further possibility of mergers in public sector banks. You need a certain scale today to operate along with investments in technology which are substantial.”  Kumar, who is also on the boards of HSBC Asia Pacific and BharatPe, further added, “There has always been a desire and need felt for larger entities in the banking system.

Parekh had said that the merger makes sense provided there is no loss of value for shareholders and considering the business synergy between two institutions.  HDFC-HDFC Bank Merger LIVE  But, there is a question on the timing of the merger; why did they choose to do it now?  One key reason could be the emerging regulatory approach of the banking regulator to NBFCs. The benefit of continuing as an NBFC is nearly absent now compared with the older times.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been tightening regulations on the NBFC sector over years, grouping these entities into different categories based on size and interconnectedness and making capital norms stricter.  As per an RBI discussion paper released early last year, these layers bracket NBFCs according to their asset size and systemic interconnectedness.  The bigger ones are grouped in the upper layer while stringent regulations will apply to the middle layer as well. The top layer is reserved for companies that are perceived to carry elevated risks akin to the banks under the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework.  Also Read | HDFC, HDFC Bank merger to create third-largest company in India  If these proposals are accepted as regulations, the top 25-30 NBFCs will have to gradually embrace bank-like regulations. That will minimise the benefit of lighter regulation they have enjoyed so far. NBFCs in the upper layer will have to comply with common equity Tier 1 capital regulations like commercial banks.    They need to maintain a 9 percent CET1 ratio. That apart, these NBFCs will have to comply with large exposure framework and listing regulations.  Clearly, the trigger for the new scale-based approach for NBFCs was aimed at disincentivizing non-banks from growing too big after the IL&amp;amp;FS and DHFL episodes. The regulator doesn’t want a parallel set of financial institutions growing in the financial system at par with the size of banks but enjoying lighter regulation. Also, the RBI wants to bring down the number of NBFCs in the banking system.  For HDFC, which is an NBFC, it makes sense to be part of the bank given the regulatory approach.  So, in a sense, what has aided the merger is the phased regulations from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which has bridged the gap of regulations between banks and non-banking finance companies. Larger NBFCs and banks aren’t very different from a regulatory perspective in terms of scrutiny and capital ratio requirements. Also, as Parekh said in the merger statement, a booming mortgage lending market offers opportunities for home loan lenders.  The Jagdishan factor?  HDFC Bank insiders say compared with the previous boss of the bank, Aditya Puri, his successor Sashidhar Jagdishan was more lenient to the idea of merger. Puri exited the bank in October, 2020. Jagdishan took charge as the new chief in October. “The change in leadership made it easier for the parent to proceed with the merger. At least that’s what the talk is,” said the insider who didn’t wish to be named.  Then there are other factors as well.  Obviously, the merger gives HDFC access to cheaper deposits as well. An NBFC typically raises funds at a higher rate from investors and money markets while a bank has access to public deposits that come at a much cheaper rate through current, savings accounts. That is certainly a beneficial factor for the merger.  What about investors? Prima facie, the deal looks good for investors.  As per the announcement today, every HDFC shareholder will get 42 shares of the bank for every 25 shares they hold. Prima facie, the deal looks good for investors. “Looking from the shareholder’s perspective, it is a positive measure. Because, the shareholders of HDFC Ltd, who was having a holding company discount issue will benefit because the holding company discount will disappear. And for shareholders of HDFC Bank too, the synergy of the combined entity will benefit them,” said J N Gupta, former executive director at the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).  With the parent finally merging the bank, the resultant entity will emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry. The window for cross selling products and leveraging the strength of the combined balance sheet will give advantage to the combined entity.  Bigger money muscle  The merged entity, with a larger balance sheet will enable HDFC to turn even more aggressive in the market. It will be only second to the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI) across all parameters. The combined entity will have a market cap of Rs 12.8 lakh crore and a balance sheet of Rs17.87 lakh crores. It will enable the HDFC Bank to undertake larger underwriting at scale. With the parent finally merging the bank, the resultant entity will emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry. HDFC Bank, on a standalone basis, had total advances of Rs 12.7 lakh crore while HDFC had Rs5.25 lakh crore. Of its total advance book, HDFC has 77 percent of its loans in the individual loan category. HDFC Bank, which has 28 percent of its loan book in retail and 26 per cent in corporate, can have the advantage of HDFC’s home loan clients joining the bank’s customers.  It also gives opportunities in cross selling of different products in the unsecured loan segment, insurance, credit cards to HDFC’s existing customers.  When will the merger process be completed?  There is still some time ahead. The merger, as guided by the parent, is expected to get completed by the second or third quarter of financial year 2024. The scheme of amalgamation will need approvals from SEBI, RBI, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) and Competition Commission of India (CCI). It will also require approvals from National Company Law Tribunals and finally will be filed with ROC.  With the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger, another giant is born in the Indian financial sector. SBI, the largest in terms of assets in the Indian banking industry, gets a bigger competitor.

SBI,2022-04-01T15:48:02+05:30,Piyush Shukla,"Banks go aggressive on co-lending; SBI, Union Bank lead with a dozen pacts in six months","SBI alone has signed at least eight co-lending agreements in the past six months, followed by Union Bank with three such pacts.","Indian banks are embracing co-lending to scale up business in an unprecedented manner. State Bank of India and Union Bank of India alone have signed about a dozen agreements for co-lending – where loans are issued jointly by two entities – in the past six months alone, senior bankers told Moneycontrol.  SBI has signed over eight such agreements while Union Bank has signed three co-lending agreements, the bankers said.  “Co-lending will be pursued as an important tool to increase the microfinance, MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) and affordable housing portfolio,” SBI chairman Dinesh Khara said on September 29.  Co-lending refers to partnerships between two lenders, typically a bank and a non-bank, to offer loans to the economically weaker sections or borrowers under the so-called priority sector lending (PSL) programme.  SBI will continue to work with more non-banking finance companies and microfinance institutions to reach out to customers living in far-flung areas and provide them last-mile banking services.  Experts said co-lending has picked up recently as banks want to aggressively tap a revival in demand for credit after a dull pandemic-phase. Co-lending helps bank to meet their PSL targets. Also, banks see an opportunity in the last-mile coverage of NBFCs and their ability to source loans quickly to meet disbursal targets.    How it works  &amp;nbsp;   Although the co-lending concept has existed in the banking sector for a while, it hasn’t picked up in a big way for various reasons.  The Reserve Bank of India had initially come out with the co-origination framework in 2018, allowing banks and NBFCs to co-originate loans. As per the RBI norms, 20 percent of the credit risk by way of direct exposure will be on an NBFC’s books till maturity and the balance will be on the bank’s books.  Upon maturity, the repayment or recovery of interest is shared by the bank and NBFC in proportion to their share of credit and interest.  The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent curbs significantly affected the banking sector’s credit growth. Bank loan growth to industry, however, improved to 6.4 percent in January 2022 from 0.7 percent in January 2021, as per RBI data released on February 28, signalling a gradual recovery in the economy.   SBI takes lead To tap into reviving credit demand, SBI, the country’s largest lender, has been pro-actively involved in co-lending. Since September, the public sector bank has signed co-lending partnerships with NBFCs in different fields of priority sector lending.  On September 29, SBI signed co-lending partnerships with Vedika Credit Capital, Save Microfinance and Paisalo Digital to disburse loans to members of joint liability groups for agriculture and allied activities, including other income-generation activities.    For co-lending to micro, small and medium enterprises, SBI signed co-lending agreements with U Gro Capital and Capri Global Capital.   SBI also formed partnerships with Adani Capital for co-lending to farmers and with five housing finance companies – PNB Housing Finance, IIFL Home Finance, Shriram Housing Finance, Edelweiss Housing Finance, and Capri Global Housing Finance – to sanction home loans.    Others too join  &amp;nbsp;   SBI is not the only PSU lender going aggressive in co-lending. Bank of Baroda projects a decent share of its disbursements coming from co-lending this year.    “FY23 would be our first complete year in co-lending, so we will look at around 5 percent of the overall disbursement,” Dhrubashish Bhattacharya, head of MSME business at Bank of Baroda, told Moneycontrol.   “As a strategy, we would like to partner with NBFCs having core competence in one or two product lines, with each partner focusing on specific product lines in specific geographies. The sectors in focus are green energy, healthcare, infrastructure and micro loans.”  Private sector lender South Indian Bank is also keen on entering the co-lending space, according to managing director Murali Ramakrishnan. The lender is in talks with Chennai-based CredAvenue to offer loans via the co-lending model and this partnership will “hopefully” start this year, Ramakrishnan told Moneycontrol.  “Co-lending is definitely something which we are looking at very seriously. We are in talks with a few NBFCs and we are looking at personal loans, gold loans and home loans,” Ramakrishnan said. “We are expecting some decent amount of book size will be built through co-lending in FY23.”  NBFCs that sign a co-lending pact with banks get access to cheap funds, while banks benefit from the last-mile reach of smaller non-banks.  This is also why Shriram Group aims to book loans of Rs 500 crore to Rs 1,000 crore via co-lending partnerships in FY23, managing director YS Chakravarti told Moneycontrol.  He said Shriram City Union has a significant part of its book under priority sector lending areas and co-lending will be focused on that part, which is mainly home loans and SME loans.  The NBFC’s housing finance subsidiary, Shriram Housing Finance, has partnered with SBI for affordable home loans and the non-bank lender will “test the waters with the new format” and see if they can look at other such partnerships with like-minded companies.  “For the model to work, both entities need to have robust technology to simplify operational challenges. Thus, only once we have confidence in the cost actually coming down for the end-user and it being a profitable means of growth for us, will we explore growing this part of the book,” Chakravarti said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/banks-go-aggressive-on-co-lending-sbi-union-bank-lead-with-a-dozen-pacts-in-six-months-8305591.html

The payments platform is eyeing an IPO in the US within 2022. ,"Merchant payments and lending platform Pine Labs has raised $50 million from United Kingdom-headquartered investment firm Vitruvian Partners, the company said on March 30.  The fundraise is one of three investments received by Pine Labs this year as the company gears up for its $500 million initial public offering (IPO) in the United States.  While Pine Labs did not reveal its valuation after the round, Moneycontrol learnt that it stands at $5-5.5 billion.  Pine Labs CEO Amrish Rau said in a statement, “At Pine Labs, we are deeply focused on the omnichannel play and are building frictionless and seamless payment experiences for our merchant partners and large enterprises. We aim to further strengthen our recent foray in online payments via Plural and take our Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) offering to new markets through strategic collaborations.”  In January this year, Pine Labs also secured a $20 million investment from India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI). This was followed by a $150 million fundraise from Alpha Wave Global.  In 2021 alone, the company raked in a total of $900 million in investments. The first $258 million was raised in May 2021 from public market crossover investors including Baron Capital Group, Duro Capital, Marshall Wace, Moore Strategic Ventures and Ward Ferry Management.  In July 2021, the company raised $600 million at a valuation of $3 billion led by Fidelity, Blackrock and other investors.  In September 2021, the firm announced it had raised $100 million more from US-based investment management company Invesco. The investment was done through the Invesco Developing Markets Fund.  “Our investment in Pine Labs follows several investments we have made into the digital payments space, and we’re excited to partner with the management team as they continue to drive digital transformation within the rapidly growing Indian payments market,” said Peter Read, partner at Vitruvian Partners.  Pine Labs’ omnichannel payments platform approach combined with its expanding geographic footprint prompted the investment, Read added.  The company’s core payment offering is point of sale machines for offline payments and it is expanding its BNPL offering in Southeast Asia. Earlier this month, the firm had launched ‘Mastercard Installments with Pine Labs’ programme with Mastercard and DBS Bank for Singapore, Indonesia, and Hong Kong with pay later instalment purchase options at the point of sale.  In the past year, Pine Labs expanded offerings and entered the consumer payments space with the acquisition of Fave in April 2021. The company also forayed into online payments with the launch of its payment gateway platform Plural in October 2021.  Plural is expected to make the offline-to-online transition easier for Pine Labs’ merchant base and is aimed at merchants and enterprises looking to set up afresh or boosting their online commerce business.  The company, backed by Sequoia Capital, Temasek Holdings, Actis, PayPal, and Mastercard among other global investors, is reported to have filed confidentially for the IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

A subsidiary of Edelweiss Financial Services, EHFL said this alliance will leverage the combined reach of both the partners in tier II and tier III markets to ensure timely disbursal of housing credit to customers.  Under the partnership, both the companies will share risks and rewards involved in the lending business.  It aims to create a conducive lending environment for Indians to fulfil their ambition of homeownership, EHFL said in a release.  For EHFL, co-lending represents an alternate model of disbursals that is asset-light and creates a sound revenue model for sustainable business, whereas for SBI — which brings capital flows at lower costs — the partnership provides wider customer reach.  For customers, co-lending provides simplicity of dealing with a single entity for their financing needs up to Rs 35 lakh, in addition to benefiting from blended cost-effective interest rates.  &quot;This collaboration will enhance our distribution network, as we aim to extend our credit reach to more home loan borrowers of the unserved and underserved segments. Such partnerships align with our commitment to accelerate effective and affordable credit to small home buyers in India and contribute to the vision of Housing for All by 2024,” Dinesh Khara, Chairman State Bank of India, said.  EHFL MD and CEO Rajat Avasthi said: &quot;Owning a home is an important milestone and dream for every Indian. And this partnership will help us fulfil that deep-rooted aspiration for Indians. I believe easy availability of home loans will also lead to higher demand in the real estate sector, which is a key driver for economic growth as well”.  The co-lending model is an evolutionary agreement that combines the expertise of public sector banks with the strong origination expertise and reach of HFCs, EHFL said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/edelweiss-housing-finance-ties-up-with-sbi-for-co-lending-in-priority-sector-home-loans-8274191.html

The five housing finance companies (HFCs) are: PNB Housing Finance, IIFL Home Finance, Shriram Housing Finance, Edelweiss Housing Finance, and Capri Global Housing Finance.  SBI said the partnerships are aimed at sanctioning home loans to the unserved and underserved sector in line with RBI guidelines.  Shortage in affordable housing continues to be a major concern for India, especially for the economically weaker section (EWS) and the informal sections of the society, SBI said in a release.  To further improve the penetration in this segment, SBI is actively looking at co-lending opportunities with multiple HFCs.  &quot;This collaboration will enhance our distribution network as we aim to extend our credit reach to more home loan borrowers of the unserved and underserved segments. Such partnerships align with our commitment to accelerate effective and affordable credit to small home buyers in India,” SBI Chairman Dinesh Khara said.  He said the tie-ups will contribute to the government’s vision of 'Housing for All by 2024’.  RBI had issued guidelines on the co-lending scheme for banks and HFCs/NBFCs for priority sector lending to improve the flow of credit to the unserved and underserved sectors of the economy and make funds available to borrowers at an affordable cost.  The co-lending model aims to give the borrower the best interest rate and better reach, it said.  In a separate release, Shriram Housing Finance said the two entities will jointly service housing loan customers as per the 20:80 co-lending model of the RBI.  &quot;The demand for housing is immense in the affordable segment and we have barely scratched the surface. Through the co-lending model, we intend to leverage the balance sheet strength of SBI and our underwriting capabilities,” Ravi Subramanian, MD &amp;amp; CEO, Shriram Housing Finance, said.  PNB Housing Finance Managing Director and CEO Hardayal Prasad said: &quot;Our strategic partnership with SBI is an important extension of our retail home loan segment, and will enable us to serve India’s working classes and underserved communities better.”  Co-lending is the future of priority sector lending, as it reduces the cost of financing for last-mile borrowers, Prasad said.  Rajesh Sharma, Managing Director, Capri Global Housing Finance, said this partnership will help increase both enterprises’ profitability and expand respective home loan portfolios.  &quot;We are confident that the collaboration with the country’s biggest lender will open up more opportunities for home finance to every credit-worthy borrower and act as an agent of change in fulfilling the dreams of owning a home,&quot; Sharma said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-ties-up-with-5-housing-finance-companies-to-further-affordable-loans-to-unserved-8271511.html
SBI,2022-03-16T17:50:29+05:30,Pushpita Dey,Russia-Ukraine war an opportunity for rupee's internationalisation: SBI's Ghosh,"India should use political stability at home and the Russia-Ukraine war as an opportunity to reach trade agreements with countries like Russia that could bypass the dollar, says SBI group chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh  ","With much of the world concerned that the Russia-Ukraine war may stall economic growth, India, too, has been trying to ensure the conflict has minimal impact on its economy. In a recent article, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at State Bank of India, wrote that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government must rely on unconventional policies to navigate the economic uncertainties that may emerge from the war.    In an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol, Ghosh spoke about how India should seize the opportunity afforded by domestic political stability and the conflict in Europe to push the rupee’s internationalisation. Edited excerpts from the interview:    Do you think there could be spill-over effects of India following an unconventional monetary policy?  Given the large size of the government borrowing programme, with inflation running at more than 6 percent and growth still recovering during a time when the war has created uncertainty, the central bank is not in a position to raise rates immediately. Thus, it needs to look at unconventional policy responses, but (at the same time) it needs to take cognisance of the fact that system liquidity is not so much in a surplus mode that it can fuel speculation.  Regarding spill-over effects, the central bank has been very conscious of the fact that liquidity modulates in the desired fashion. Due to the uncertainty, the liquidity normalisation, which was getting to the desired pace, has been disrupted in February and March, so I believe it is important to take these steps at this point of time so as to manage overall macroeconomic stability. Thus, there is no need to be too much concerned about the spill-over effects.  India has a large number of crypto investors and crypto may have a role in the war. Can it affect Indian crypto investors?   I don’t think investors need to have any such fear...the government of India has mentioned very clearly that it is going to tax all sorts of crypto transactions at the rate of 30 percent. Currently, the central bank is working on a digital currency and hopefully, the introduction of the digital currency tool will be able to take care of the financial stability risks posed by the crypto market. So, there is hardly any chance of financial instability being caused through the crypto market due to the war situation.   Will India alone adopting unconventional monetary policy help calm markets unnerved by the war?  Unconventional monetary policies are always specific to the country itself. While India could adopt such a policy, it may not be appropriate for other countries. Therefore, every country has its own unique position. So, the monetary policy a central bank will be implementing in a country would be in consonance with the particular objectives of the central bank in the particular country. However, an unconventional monetary policy could also be supplemented with some out-of-the-box thinking (to push the internationalisation of the rupee).  ... we all know that the US dollar is the reserve currency and no currency has been able to replace the dollar. That is the reason why every country finds it difficult to diversify its foreign exchange reserves. The Chinese currency has also not been able to do it because there is an element of trust factor. The European Union currency also failed to do it.   Given the fact that India currently is in a position of political stability, India can use this opportunity to get into some sort of trade agreement with some countries like Russia that could bypass the dollar. So, the intention of the Indian currency can be to use the current conflict as an opportunity. There is no harm for India to try and push its currency for internationalisation across borders. It will help the country’s future prospects.  Can an unconventional monetary policy affect foreign direct investment (FDI) in India and cause capital outflow?  I don’t think there could be such a risk. During the pandemic when the FDI inflows declined in Asia, India continued to receive a significant amount of the FDI and a large part of that went to the start-ups. Thus I think there is no such one-to-one causation between capital flow and FDI.   The capital flow from foreign countries is also a function of the macroeconomic stability of the country and also is a risk of sentiment globally. Given the fact that the Fed is likely to raise rates this year, there could be a reversal of capital flows from the emerging economies due to higher rates. This factor is more important to be addressed rather than the fact that unconventional monetary policy could steer capital outflow.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/russia-ukraine-war-an-opportunity-for-rupees-internationalisation-says-sbi-group-chief-economic-advisor-ghosh-8240501.html

They also said the current account deficit (CAD) will be at 3.5 per cent if crude oil trades at USD 130 a barrel, pulling down growth to 7.1 per cent.  If FY23 average oil price rises to USD 100 a barrel, it will pull down growth to around 7.6 per cent from 8 per cent estimated earlier, inflation will rise to 5 per cent from 4.5 per cent, and the current account gap will jump to USD 86.6 billion or 2.5 per cent of GDP and can soar to 3.5 per cent if oil prices average at USD 130 billion.  In that case, inflation will trend at 5.7 per cent and GDP growth will come down to 7.1 per cent, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, the group chief economic adviser at State Bank of India, said in a note on Monday.  The rupee is the worst hit emerging market currency since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the resultant sweeping economic sanctions against Moscow.  Crude has been on the boil since the invasion -- jumping from USD 93 to USD 130 a barrel last week, before moderating to USD 110 levels.  Russia supplies as much as 14 per cent of global crude supplies and 17 per cent of world's natural gas.  The near-term outlook for the rupee remains challenging until geopolitical tensions moderate. With uncertainties being high, this can further dampen portfolio inflows, which have already been in reverse gear so far in 2022 with outflows worth USD 12 billion, he said.  The war has led to almost all other commodities, including agri commodities, witnessing price increases.  Forecasting really tough time for the rupee, which had last week plunged to a record low of 77.01, he said if the Ukraine conflict drags on for now, rupee can tumble to 77.5 by June and marginally improve to 77 to a dollar by December 2022.  Even if the Russian-Ukraine conflict drags on for now, though the rupee is likely to trade in an elevated zone, the FY23 average should not be higher than 76-78, with an appreciating bias, Ghosh added.  During the last global financial crisis, the rupee continued to decline and lost around 13 per cent during January 2008 to July 2011. However, after the crisis, the volatility became significant and the rupee plunged by a whopping 41 per cent during July 2011 to November 2013.  On the impact of the extreme volatility in crude oil prices on CAD, inflation and GDP, he said every USD 10 per barrel increase in Brent prices will lead to increase in inflation by 20-25 bps, widen the current account deficit by 35 bps of GDP, increase fiscal deficit by 8 bps and lower GDP by 15-20 bps.  Crude sticking above USD 100 level for next few months along with hurting commodity prices can be the Damocles sword for emerging markets, he noted.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/ukraine-war-sbi-sees-rupee-at-77-5-by-june-cad-at-3-5-if-crude-boils-gdp-growth-at-7-1-8232141.html

Swift absorption and adoption of new technology and innovation, and quality of infrastructure are crucial elements that play a significant role in building confidence in the digital lending system, he said.  Going forward, banks of all sizes and across regions will make a huge difference by enabling digital initiatives to maintain a competitive edge and deliver a maximum value to customers, he noted.  During a panel discussion at the event, Indian Banks' Association (IBA) Chief Executive Sunil Mehta said the payment space has been digitalised and now it is time for digitisation of lending space.  &quot;The next stage of banking, where the lending space has to be digitised, is on and banks are working on it,&quot; Mehta added.  He said digitisation of some of the lending products has already been started by banks, but a very small number of products are available that are digitised end-to-end. &quot;There is a need for digitisation of the entire lending eco-space,&quot; he noted.  Mehta said that technovation is gradually happening in the banking industry and now the speed is more driven by the pandemic.  During the pandemic, everybody has realised the importance of alternate delivery channels for banking services, he said.  While addressing the event, International Finance Corporation (IFC) Country head (India) Wendy Werner said India is quickly evolving as a digital-enabled economy.  The country has the highest fintech adoption rate in the world and much of this is coming from tier 2 and tier 3 cities, she said.  &quot;So, we are very positive about the impact of fintech and the ability of fintech to expand access to finance, services and information for the population in India. Globally, we have estimated that the fintech market in India is around $50-60 billion and we expect it to grow,&quot; she said.  Werner said India is a huge market and potentially there are many startups looking to take advantage of that market.  Approximately, 2,100 fintech startups are looking at the Indian market and it is probably increasing every day.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/digitisation-innovative-technologies-creating-unprecedented-disruption-in-banking-sector-sbi-dinesh-khara-8222261.html

SBI,2022-02-14T12:26:53+05:30,Jash Kriplani,R Srinivasan of SBI Mutual Fund is back with a new focused scheme. Should you invest?,The SBI Multicap Fund will build its portfolio based on ideas generated by its team of 15 sector analysts. ,"A change in rules has opened up the multi-cap category for mutual funds. Now, SBI Mutual Fund, India’s largest asset manager, is launching its own multi-cap fund. The new fund offer (NFO) opens on February 14.  What’s the scheme about?  The Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) rules state that a multi-cap fund needs to invest a minimum of 25 percent each in small-cap, mid-cap and large-cap stocks. However, the SBI Multicap Fund will invest 27 percent in each of these categories, with the remainder left to the fund manager’s discretion.  Ruchit Mehta, head of research at SBI MF, said the additional allocation (27 percent instead of 25 percent) is being made as a buffer against market volatility. While the fund will be managed by R Srinivasan, who is head of equity at SBI MF, the portfolio will be built based on ideas generated by its team of 15 sector analysts.  What works  The fund will be benchmarked against Nifty 500 Multicap 50:25:25, but it will not try to align its sector weights just to be closer to the index weights.  As Mehta pointed out, any scheme out there today that’s benchmarked against large-cap indices is forced to make a heavy allocation to the financial services sector, which has as much as a 33 percent weightage in large-cap indices.  “So a benchmark-conscious fund manager will have to manage sector weights so as to reduce the risk of underperforming the index,” he said.  SBI Multicap Fund will not depend upon index weights to construct its portfolio.  The portfolio will capture stock investment ideas through the analyst team’s research framework. The stock research process that the analyst team follows will filter high-conviction investment ideas from SBI MF’s 750 stock coverage, which is split into passive and active universes.  The ideas generated by the analysts will be ranked in order of their preference. Each analyst will assign a confidence score, ranging from 1 to 5, to each stock idea, reflecting their view on aspects such as the company’s fundamentals, growth potential, management quality, and valuations.  There will be an overlay of sector outlook, with preference given to stocks on which the fund house has a positive view.  This list of high-conviction ideas will include international stocks. The fund has built in a provision to invest up to 10 percent of the scheme’s funds in international stocks.  The fund manager will pick from analysts' high-conviction ideas and account for factors such as liquidity of the stock, existing stock ownership and whether a meaningful allocation can be made to the stock. He will take a call on how much funds should be allocated to a particular stock.  What doesn’t  The fund will aim to keep the number of stocks in its portfolio in the range of 30-35 at any given point of time. So, it will be run like a focused fund.  “While taking high-conviction investment calls can give outsized returns, it can also lead to concentration risks, if not managed carefully,” said Rupesh Nagda, founder of Family First Capital.  “There are several research papers out there that suggest that beyond 20 stocks, the benefits of diversification peters down significantly,” said Srinivasan.  A multi-cap fund may go through periods of higher volatility than flexi-cap schemes due to the former’s higher allocations to mid- and small-caps.  Also, multi-cap funds may do well when the broader markets rally, but could underperform if the markets turn narrow and large-cap stocks lead the gains. During such periods, flexi-cap funds could outperform as they can increase their large-cap exposure.  Vishal Dhawan, founder of Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors, said flexi-cap funds may be more suitable for investors right now, given the lack of clarity on whether current market valuations are justified or excessive.  “Getting into a flexi-cap fund with a track record would be better as the fund manager has the flexibility to move allocations across market segments, with no minimum limits,” he said.  Moneycontrol’s take  Srinivasan has considerable experience managing funds with high-conviction investment calls.

The CBI has booked ABG Shipyard Limited, its former chairman and managing director Rishi Kamlesh Agarwal and others for allegedly cheating a consortium of banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) of over Rs 22,842 crore.  &quot;Why did it take five years after the liquidation proceedings of ABG Shipyard to lodge even an FIR for duping 28 banks of Rs 22,842 crore?&quot; Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala asked at a press conference here. &quot;Why did the Modi government refuse to take note of the allegations made on February 15, 2018 by the Congress, warning of a scam in ABG Shipyard, and why no FIR was lodged and criminal action taken despite their accounts having been declared as fraud on June 19, 2019?&quot; he asked.  ALSO READ: CBI books ABG Shipyard, former top brass in biggest bank fraud case of over Rs 22,842 crore  Surjewala said the SBI wrote to the CBI in November 2018, &quot;saying there was a fraud committed by ABG Shipyard and seeking the registration of an FIR and criminal action. Despite this, nothing happened and the CBI pushed the files back to the SBI. Public money keeps getting swindled, but no FIR is lodged&quot;. On August 25, 2020, the SBI filed a second complaint with the CBI, saying &quot;please register an FIR as this is a case of cheating and fraud. But the CBI still does not act. It waits for another year and a half. Finally, now, after five years, this FIR has been registered&quot;, he added.  &quot;The complicity, the collusion and the connivance of those sitting in the highest echelons of the Modi government with bank fraudsters is writ large,&quot; the Congress leader alleged. He said it was the &quot;biggest bank fraud&quot; witnessed by the country.  Surjewala said there seems to be a &quot;loot-and-escape&quot; scheme for bank fraudsters while pointing out many instances in the past and adding that the accused in these cases are now in foreign shores. He alleged that &quot;these indelible facts reflect the gross mismanagement of the banking system, holding the banking system captive to fraudsters and the initiation of the loot-and-escape flagship scheme for bank fraudsters&quot;.  &quot;Over the last seven-and-a-half years of the Modi government, incidents of bank fraud involving a total amount of Rs 5.35 lakh crore have been reported. During this period, the write-offs by the banks in India is Rs 8.17 lakh crore. &quot;Bank NPAs amounted to Rs 21 lakh crore between 2014 and 2021. That is the state of gross mismanagement of people's money, which is lying in the banking system,&quot; the Congress leader said, adding, &quot;India woke up to the rude shock of the biggest ever bank fraud in the last 75 years involving Rs 22,842 crore.&quot;  He claimed that ABG Shipyard was allotted 1.21 lakh square metres of land in 2007 by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Gujarat. &quot;The comptroller and auditor general had indicted the then Gujarat government for undue favours to ABG Shipyard and Rishi Agarwal over allotting land at Rs 700 per square metre, while the price of the land was 100 per cent higher, that is Rs 1,400 per square metre,&quot; Surjewala said.  He said the then Gujarat government proceeded to allot 50 hectares of land to ABG Shipyard in Dahej. The SBI had first filed a complaint on November 8, 2019 on which the CBI had sought some clarifications on March 12, 2020.  The bank filed a fresh complaint in August 2020. After &quot;scrutinising&quot; the complaint for a year and and a half, the CBI acted on the complaint, filing an FIR on February 7 this year. In its complaint, the SBI said ABG Shipyard Limited (ABGSL) is the flagship company of the ABG Group, which is engaged in the business of ship building and ship repair.  Reacting on the recent development, SBI said, &quot;ABG Shipyard was incorporated on 15 March 1985, has been banking arrangements since 2001. Financed under Consortium arrangement over a two dozen lenders. The leader in Consortium was ICICI Bank. Due to poor performance, the account became NPA on 30/11/2013. Several efforts were made to revive the company operations but could not succeed.&quot;  The nationalised bank added, &quot; The account was restructured under the CDR mechanism in March 2014 by all lenders. However, as the shipping industry was going through a downturn, one of the worst ever seen, the operations of the company could not revive.As the restructuring failed, the account was classified as NPA in July 2016 with backdated effect from 30th Nov. 2013. E&amp;amp;Y was appointed as Forensic Auditor by lenders during April 2018 and they submitted their report on January 19. E&amp;amp;Y report was placed before the Fraud Identification Committee of 18 Lenders in 2019. Fraud is mainly attributed to diversion of funds, misappropriation, and criminal breach of trust.&quot;  Furthermore, the SBI said that ICICI Bank was the lead lender in the consortium and IDBI was the second lead, it was preferred that SBI being the largest PSB lender, lodges the complaint with CBI. The first complaint was filed with CBI in Nov 2019. There was a continuous engagement between CBI and Banks and further information was getting exchanged, it added.&quot;  &quot;The circumstances of the fraud, as well as CBI requirements, were further deliberated in the various meetings of Joint Lenders and a fresh and comprehensive second complaint was filed in Dec. 2020. The account is presently undergoing liquidation under an NCLT driven process.A fraud is declared basis the Forensic Audit report findings that are discussed thoroughly in joint lenders meetings. Typically when fraud is declared, an initial complaint is preferred with CBI, and based on their enquiries further information is gathered. In a few cases, when substantial additional information is gathered, a second compliant incorporating full and complete details is filed which forms the basis for the FIR. At no point in time, there was any effort to delay the process.  The lender's forum diligently follows through with CBI in all such cases,&quot; SBI said in a statement.&quot;   ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/congress-questions-modi-govt-over-abg-shipyard-bank-fraud-case-8086431.html
SBI,2022-02-11T15:59:41+05:30,PTI,"RBI believes differing policy strategy, policy stance can coexist: SBI report","On Thursday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) surprised the market with a policy statement that has a lower gross domestic product (GDP) at 7.8 per cent and an inflation forecast at 4.5 per cent for FY23. ","Stating that the RBI has surprised everyone with its status quo on rates and accommodative stance for the 10th time in a row and a lower forecast for inflation and growth for FY23, SBI Research said that with this, the central bank has set a clear distinction between policy strategy and policy stance and that these can coexist simultaneously. As result, the bond yields have shed seven basis points (bps) to 6.73 per cent on Thursday after touching 6.88 per cent on the Budget day when the government said it would borrow a record Rs 14.3 lakh crore to fund its capex (capital expenditure) plans of Rs 7.5 lakh crore.  On Thursday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) surprised the market with a policy statement that has a lower gross domestic product (GDP) at 7.8 per cent and an inflation forecast at 4.5 per cent for FY23. This translates into a WPI (Wholesale Price Index) projection of around 2.8 per cent in FY23. The lower inflation forecast has taken the market by surprise and the 10-year yields declined by seven bps to close at 6.73 per cent after falling 10 bps immediately after the policy was announced.  ALSO READ: Your debt mutual fund investments after RBI policy: Three top fund managers advise what to do  SBI Chief Economic Advisor Soumya Kanti Ghosh expects the yields to decline further to settle at 6.55-6.6 per cent. He also said that even though the market was surprised by the tone of the policy, the RBI may have moved ahead of the market in terms of expectations.  As a result, FY23 could usher in a new era of separate strategy and separate stance, an unconventional monetary policy setting in the true sense, Ghosh added. The RBI has taken three bets in its quest for a lower term structure of interest rates and while doing so, it has also indicated to the market that it is comfortable with making a clear distinction between policy strategy and policy stance and that these can coexist, Ghosh said.  While a policy strategy might indicate the RBI calibrating the liquidity normalisation to ensure that government borrowings face no disruption, the policy stance may still indicate rate adjustment to quell inflation expectations, should inflation surprise on the upside beyond tolerance, he said. These two mutually complement each other as the central bank has several non-conventional policy tools to adjust government borrowings, he added.  Explaining further, Ghosh said the three bets are crude price, US yields and government borrowing programme that determine yield trajectory and these will largely be under control. While crude price increase may have bottomed out, the US yields are on the northward side due to a record high inflation print of 7.5 per cent, which is a 40-year-high level.  The third and the largest elephant in the room is the size of government borrowing (net market borrowing of Rs 11.2 lakh crore, and gross of Rs 14.3 lakh crore) which he expects could be lower by at least Rs 2.5 lakh crore. Notably, small saving rates continue to be attractive. In FY22, small savings collections exceeded the budgeted amount by Rs 2 lakh crore, resulting in net borrowing falling short by Rs 1.7 lakh crore and the challenge lies in FY23 with net borrowings increasing by Rs 3.4 lakh crore but small savings lower by Rs 1.7 lakh crore than the revised FY22 amount.  He expects small saving schemes to continue to surpass budgetary expectations amid surplus savings of households and large rate differential with bank deposit rates in FY23. This is because the government has budgeted Rs 1.75 lakh crore surplus cash balances for FY23 but it could end up having higher surplus cash balances by at least Rs 1 lakh crore, which in turn will provide some relief to the market borrowing, he said.  Ghosh added that if small savings and short-term borrowings through treasury bills are higher by another Rs 1.5 lakh crore, net market borrowing will come down to just Rs 8.7 lakh crore, massively down from the budgeted Rs 11.2 lakh crore. Similarly, if there is no more borrowing in the remaining part of the current fiscal, market borrowing will come down by Rs 71,000 crore, leading to a net borrowing of Rs 7.04 lakh crore as against the revised estimate of Rs 7.75 lakh crore. This could help the bond yields head southwards and even touch 6.55-6.6 per cent in FY22.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rbi-believes-differing-policy-strategy-policy-stance-can-coexist-sbi-report-8081271.html

The bank is well-positioned to take benefits of the economic recovery. We find SBI is better placed with respect to asset quality, capitalisation, and underwriting strengths. With its business strengths (being India’s largest bank), we expect its NII and profitability to bounce back in the next 2-3 years, helped by higher margins. We expect the bank to benefit from the recovery in the benign corporate credit cycle. In addition, SBI’s stronger deposit franchise, support from subsidiaries, and a low risk of dilution (as compared to PSU bank peers) further support valuations.

SBI,2022-01-31T09:30:34+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan,Banking Central | Bad Bank is ready; can it make a difference?,The Bad Bank will absorb bad assets from banks but proper execution and asset resolution will be key to make sure the project doesn’t meet the fate of some of the earlier initiatives.,"After much delay, the so-called Bad Bank is finally ready to take off. On 28 January, at a video press conference called at a short notice, State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara announced that the project had received all necessary approvals to take off. Around 15 cases worth Rs 50,000 crore will be transferred to the proposed bad bank in this financial year, he said. An estimated Rs 2 lakh crore worth of bad assets are planned to be transferred to the Bad Bank.  A total of 38 accounts with Rs 83,000 crore outstanding in total have been identified for transfer so far but some have been resolved already, Khara added. The dual structure of Bad Bank will be a public-private collaboration with public sector banks having a majority stake in the National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd (NARCL) while private banks will have a significant stake in India Debt Resolution Company Ltd, he said.  So far so good. But what’s next?  For sure, the Bad Bank’s journey won’t be a smooth one—even with all that government backing and banking sector. There will be two key challenges—valuation and asset resolution.  Remember, the bad assets waiting to be absorbed by the Bad Bank are really bad assets, which means banks have already tried to resolve these cases for several years but clearly haven’t had much luck. Banks transferring these assets will always want the highest possible valuation but the asset reconstruction companies getting these assets would want a cheaper deal.  Thus, to begin with, most of these bad assets are already fully provided for, written down accounts on the books of banks. They no longer nurture hopes of any meaningful recovery from these assets. Coming to the Bad Bank deal, the most critical part will be how banks arrive at a valuation for the transfer of these assets to NARCL.  Even if some mechanism for price discovery is worked out, the value of the assets is unlikely to exceed 10 percent to 20 percent of the assets at the time of transfer. Banks will want maximum value for the assets being transferred.    The second challenge is the timely resolution.  According to details shared by the finance minister at a press conference last year, banks will receive 15 percent of the value of assets being transferred upfront in cash; 85 percent will be given as security receipts (SRs). If the debt resolution doesn’t happen within a five-year period, the government will have to pay banks against the SRs if the guarantee is invoked. There are no takers for such assets. Bad Bank managers will have their task cut out.  The limited success of the earlier asset resolution mechanisms including debt recovery tribunals, existing asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) and corporate debt restructuring mechanism shows how difficult it is to get such assets back to performing ones and find value in such assets and get takers. Nevertheless, the Bad Bank is a step in the right direction. Hopefully, this will help the Indian banking sector--saddled with bad loans-- to clean up their books and be ready for a fresh start.  But proper execution and asset resolution will be key to make sure the project doesn’t meet the fate of some of the earlier much-hyped initiatives.

In view of the public sentiments, SBI has decided to keep the revised instructions regarding recruitment of pregnant women candidates in abeyance and continue with the existing instructions in the matter, the bank said in a statement. The move came after Delhi Commission for women intervened in the matter and asked the bank explain its action. The SBI circular dated 31 December said if pregnancy is of more than 3 months, the candidate will be considered temporarily unfit and she may be allowed to join within 4 months after delivery of child.  Responding to this circular, Delhi Women’s commission on 29 January said the action of the bank appears to be discriminatory and illegal as it is contrary to the maternity benefits provided under the ‘Code of Social Security, 2020.’  Further, the rule discriminates on the basis of sex which is against the fundamental rights provided under the constitution, the notice issued by the commission said.

Banks are weighed down by huge amounts of bad loans, or loans on which no interest or principal has been paid for over 90 days.   Stress tests have revealed that banks' gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) may jump from 6.9 percent of assets in September 2021 to 8.1 percent by September 2022 under a baseline scenario and to 9.5 percent under a severe stress scenario, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its Financial Stability Report on December 29.  If the current wave of COVID-19 led by the Omicron variant drags on, the figure could escalate.  According to the plan, banks will receive 15 percent of the value of assets being transferred upfront in cash; 85 percent will be given as security receipts (SRs). If the debt resolution doesn’t happen within a five-year period, the government will have to pay banks against the SRs if the guarantee is invoked.  Khara said he expects resolutions to happen faster  with NARCL in place.  An important development  Launch of bad bank is crucial for the banking sector if it leads to faster bad assets resolution.  Banks need to set aside more money to cover bad loans known as provisions in banking industry jargon. The higher the provisions, the bigger is the pain felt by the bank—its profitability subsequently takes a hit. The bank will require more capital to plug the bad loan hole.  A huge pile of bad loans on its balance sheet impairs the ability of a bank to extend fresh loans. When credit growth slows, as was the case to industries over the last few years, the economy suffers. This (economic slowdown and consequent job losses) further impacts the ability of companies and individuals to repay bank loans.   &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/bad-bank-received-all-necessary-approvals-to-commence-operations-sbi-chairman-dinesh-khara-7997181.html

Tata Group, which won the bid to acquire the national carrier along with Air India Express and 50 per cent stake in AISATS in October last year, is expected to formally takeover the airline on Thursday.  Also Read: First challenge for Tata after Air India take-over: Schedule integration across 4 airlines  Sources said the SBI-led consortium has agreed to grant both term loans and working capital loans depending on the airline’s requirements.

Check all the LIVE updates on Tata takes over Air India HERE  Talace Private Limited — a subsidiary of the Tata Group’s holding company Tata Sons — on October 8, 2021, won the bid to acquire debt-ridden Air India.  Also Read: The Tatas should be as resolute running Air India as the government was in selling it  A unit of the holding company of the salt-to-software conglomerate had offered Rs 18,000 crore as part of its winning bid — Rs 15,300 crore for Air India’s existing debt and Rs 2,700 crore to be paid as cash to the government.  On October 11, 2021, a Letter of Intent (LoI) was issued to the Tata Group confirming the government’s willingness to sell its 100 per cent stake in the airline.  On October 25, the Centre signed the share purchase agreement for the deal.  The term loans to Talace will help in retiring the high cost borrowings of Air India, the sources said.  The deal with the government does not include land and buildings.  As per the agreement, Tata Group will retain all the employees of Air India at least for a year.  With the acquisition, Tata Group will have access to a fleet of 117 wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, and 24 narrow-body aircraft of Air India Express.  Besides, it will get control of 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing, and parking slots at domestic airports.  Tata Group had surpassed the Rs 15,100 crore-offer by a consortium led by SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh and the reserve price of Rs 12,906 crore set by the government for the sale of its 100 per cent stake in the loss-making carrier.  While this will be the Centre’s first privatisation since 2003-04, Air India will be the third airline brand in the Tatas’ stable as it holds a majority interest in AirAsia India and Vistara, a joint venture with Singapore Airlines Ltd.  As of August 31, Air India had a total debt of Rs 61,562 crore.  Around 75 per cent of this debt or Rs 46,262 crore will be transferred to a special purpose vehicle AIAHL before handing over the loss-making airline to Tata Group.  Air India started suffering losses every year since its merger with Indian Airlines in 2007-08.  A Turnaround Plan (TAP) and a Financial Restructuring Plan (FRP) were approved for Air India by the previous UPA regime in 2012.  However, the TAP did not work out as expected and Air India continued to reel under losses.  Over the last decade, more than Rs 1.10 lakh crore has been infused by way of cash support and loan guarantees into Air India to keep it afloat.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tatas-gets-loan-commitment-from-sbi-led-consortium-for-air-india-7991171.html
SBI,2022-01-17T08:55:40+05:30,Priyanka Iyer,"Account Aggregators link up 80,000 bank accounts, but SBI is yet to go live","While the AA ecosystem is working to enable the linking of securities and SME accounts, SBI weighs a pricing model as it will become the largest data provider once live","The Account Aggregator (AA) framework, which is expected to transform the way financial data is shared, has seen more than eight-fold spurt in the number of bank accounts linked across last 20 weeks.  The ecosystem is still waiting for India’s largest lender, the State Bank of India (SBI), to go live.  According to data by Sahamati, the not-for-profit self-organised collective for the AA ecosystem, the number of linked bank accounts has gone up from 10,000 in the second week of September 2021 to 80,000 now. The ecosystem has fulfilled 67,000 consent requests till date.  The account aggregator, simply put, facilitates sharing of financial information in a real-time basis between regulated entities. AAs are licensed by the Reserve Bank of India to enable the flow of data between Financial Information Providers (FIPs) and Financial Information Users (FIUs).  FIPs are institutions that hold customer data and FIUs are entities that consume data to offer better service, underwrite loans, etc. An AA is data blind and only receives encrypted data which is decrypted only by the FIP.  “The past few months have been more of testing the system and making sure that you know that things stand up. The click-through rates, success rates are good. The next step for us now is to grow the number of FIPs and the types of accounts types,” Srikanth Rajagopalan, Chief Executive Officer of Perfios Account Aggregation Services, said.  As of now, only individual current and savings accounts and deposits can be linked to AAs. The huge pool of small and medium enterprise (SME) accounts and asset classes like securities, insurance and mutual funds need to be opened up to AAs. This is likely to happen over the next few months.  “Our focus is to now get more banks to go live. We also have to work on cross-sectoral implementation, product and user journey. Insurance companies have started working on implementation. For mutual fund players, we are in talks with them but implementation is yet to begin,” BG Mahesh, Co-founder and CEO of Sahamati, said.  SBI, which has the largest share of accounts in India, however, is working on a pricing model because the bank wants to be compensated as it will be the largest information provider.  “SBI is still trying to figure out a financial model. They want a per data pool pricing to be agreed upon, or a share in the profit earned by the FIUs through the data received. Some of the FIUs are not really open to this idea, but a few are,” said a senior executive with an NBFC on condition of anonymity.  Once SBI goes on board, other large public banks too will follow suit. Sahamati’s website shows that SBI and Kotak Mahindra Bank are in the testing mode. SBI’s participation is also key because it will open the window for a huge pool of the bank’s customers to use the AA framework and allow easy access to financial services.  The bank is also working on the infrastructure needed to manage and share the huge pool of data it possesses. Since the data has to be accessed from the core banking system, it will require additional levels of security and audits.  “The exact viable business model is yet to be identified. SBI acknowledges that they have a huge role to play as the largest bank in the country. Ultimately it will be a positive for them as well because the largest providers also end up being the largest users of data. It’s far more efficient and saves a lot of costs,” said Perfios’ Rajagopalan.  However, with the framework still at nascent stages, the overall value proposition for large banks is still getting proven. Once there is enough data on usage of the framework, it will become clearer how big banks are set to also benefit as users of data, Rajagopalan said.  The RBI, too, is keeping a close watch on this and may intervene only if the pace does not pick up after some more time has passed.  “From our conversations with the RBI, we understand that if most banks don’t go live after a certain point, then the regulator may consider making it mandatory for all banks to share data through AAs,” said the executive quoted above.  Six banks are live on the ecosystem, including Axis Bank, Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank and IndusInd bank. Eleven more NBFCs and investment advisors too are live as FIPs and FIUs.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/account-aggregators-link-up-80000-bank-accounts-but-sbi-is-yet-to-go-live-7944831.html

This perception of TBTF creates an expectation of government support for these banks in times of distress.,"The RBI on Tuesday said state-owned SBI, along with private sector lenders ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank continue to be Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) or institutions which are 'too big to fail'.  SIBs are perceived as banks that are 'too big to fail (TBTF)'. This perception of TBTF creates an expectation of government support for these banks in times of distress. Due to this perception, these lenders enjoy certain advantages in the funding markets.  ''SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank continue to be identified as Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs), under the same bucketing structure as in the 2020 list of D-SIBs,'' the Reserve Bank said in a statement.  The additional Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) requirement for D-SIBs was phased-in from April 1, 2016 and became fully effective from April 1, 2019.  The additional CET1 requirement will be in addition to the capital conservation buffer.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had announced SBI and ICICI Bank as D-SIBs in 2015 and 2016.  Based on data collected from banks as on March 31, 2017, HDFC Bank was also classified as a D-SIB.  The current update is based on data collected from banks as on March 31, 2021.  The framework for dealing with D-SIBs was issued in July 2014.  The framework requires the RBI to disclose the names of banks designated as D-SIBs starting from 2015 and place these lenders in appropriate buckets depending upon their Systemic Importance Scores (SISs).  Based on the bucket in which a D-SIB is placed, an additional common equity requirement has to be applied to it.  The Additional Common Equity Tier 1 requirement as a percentage of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) in case of SBI is 0.6 per cent, and 0.2 per cent for ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-icici-bank-hdfc-bank-continue-to-remain-systemically-important-banks-rbi-7899151.html

State Bank of India (SBI), the country's largest public sector bank, has made a $20-million investment in the merchant platform company, Pine Labs said on January 4.  Commenting on the fundraise, B Amrish Rau, CEO of Pine Labs, said “In the last one year, several marquee investors have placed their trust in our business model and growth momentum and that is a gratifying feeling. This association with SBI is a personally satisfying experience as I had started my career selling financial services technology to SBI.”  In 2021, Pine Labs raked in a total of $700 million across two rounds of fundraising. The first $600 million was raised in July 2021 at a valuation of $3 billion led by Fidelity, Blackrock and other investors.  In September 2021, the company announced it has raised $100 million more from US-based investment management company Invesco. The investment was done through the Invesco Developing Markets Fund.  The company, which provides merchant payment, PoS, and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) solutions, is also backed by Sequoia Capital, Temasek Holdings, Actis, PayPal, and Mastercard amongst other global investors.  Pine Labs is working on expanding its BNPL business across India and Southeast Asia and entered the consumer payment space with its April 2021 acquisition of Fave.  In October last year, Pine Labs forayed into the online payments space with a payment gateway platform named Plural.  Plural is expected to make the offline-to-online transition easier for Pine Labs’ merchant base and is aimed towards merchants and enterprises looking to set up afresh or augment their existing online commerce business.  SBI's last investment in a fintech company was in digital payments platform Cashfree in June 2021.  The public sector bank's investment comes ahead of Pine Labs' planned IPO, for which the company is reported to have appointed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as advisors. It is eyeing a valuation of $6 billion through the IPO.  In an interview with Moneycontrol in April 2021, Rau had revealed that Pine Labs had been in touch with law firms, auditors, and bankers for a year, but has not yet decided on when it will list.  Founded in 1998, Pine Labs processes payments worth $30 million in a year. It serves over 150,000 merchants in 3,700 cities across Asia and the Middle East. It has also enabled its BNPL credit service to 150,000 outlets.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/pine-labs-gets-20-mn-investment-from-sbi-ahead-of-ipo-7898441.html
SBI,2021-12-31T17:27:58+05:30,Mansi Verma,The year in review: SEBI’s notable decisions in 2021,"In a year when the stock markets boomed and set new record highs, the market regulator took some key decisions in a bid to make the system fairer and more transparent for investors.","The year 2021 will be memorable for many reasons. One of the best examples is this year’s record-breaking stock market performance – 65 companies went public and the benchmark indices skyrocketed, with the BSE Sensex crossing the 50,000 mark for the first time.  With stocks booming, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the market regulator, had its hands full over the past 12 months, changing norms to strengthen the system and make it fairer and more transparent for investors.  A look back at SEBI’s notable decisions taken at its six board meetings over the year.  IPO reforms, mutual fund regulations, NII allocations - December 28     At its last board meeting of 2021, Sebi amended mutual fund regulations, tweaked allocations for non-institutional investors (NIIs) and fine-tuned rules for initial public offerings.  IPO reforms   The board amended the norms for making an offer for sale during an IPO. As per the new rules, shareholders with more than 20 percent of the pre-issue shareholding cannot sell more than half their stake during an IPO. An investor with a less than 20 percent stake cannot sell more than 10 percent of the pre-issue shareholding of the issuer.  The regulator increased the lock-in period for anchor investors. For 50 percent of the portion allocated to anchor investors, a lock-in of 90 days from the date of allotment will apply for issues opening on or after April 1, 2022, Sebi said in a press release. The existing lock-in of 30 days will continue for the remaining 50 percent.  The board tightened the amount that companies can raise for the future, as yet unidentified acquisitions or investment targets. In the case of book-built issues, a minimum price band of at least 105 percent of the floor price will apply for all issues opening on or after notification.  NII allocation norms  The regulator revised the allocation norms for non-institutional investors. From April 1, 2022, for book-built issues, two-thirds of the portion available for NIIs will be reserved for those applying for more than Rs 10 lakh of shares, while the remainder will be for those bidding for shares worth Rs 2 lakh to Rs 10 lakh.  Mutual fund regulation  The board made it mandatory for trustees of a mutual fund to obtain the consent of a majority of unitholders for winding up a scheme. Sebi approved a mandate for mutual funds to follow the Indian Accounting Standard from FY24.  Superior voting rights, SSE framework, silver ETFs - September 28  Sebi proposed to ease rules related to superior voting rights, approved the creation of the Social Stock Exchange, and introduced silver exchange-traded funds, among other decisions.  Superior voting rights   Sebi said at its meeting that promoters with a net worth of up to Rs 1,000 crore could have superior voting rights in their companies, increasing the threshold from Rs 500 crore.  Social stock exchange  The board approved the creation of the SSE for fundraising by social enterprises. The SSE framework was developed based on the recommendations of a working group and a technical group constituted by the market regulator.  Silver exchange-traded funds  The board approved the amendment to the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, to allow silver ETFs under safeguards similar to those governing gold ETFs under the existing regulatory framework.  FPI constituents  To facilitate investment in the Indian securities markets through the foreign portfolio investment (FPI) route, the board permitted resident Indians (other than individuals) to become constituents of FPIs that are registered as alternative investment funds in International Financial Services Centres.  IPO reforms, relaxation of disclosure requirements - August 6   Sebi decided to reform IPO rules and simplify requirements for group company disclosures.  IPO reforms   Sebi amended the lock-in period for an issue that involves an offer for sale or financing, other than for capital expenditure for a project. The minimum promoters’ contribution of 20 percent, in such cases, should be locked in for 18 months from the date of allotment in the IPO and follow-on public offer. Currently, the lock-in period is three years.  In all these cases, the promoter shareholding above the minimum contribution will be locked in for six months instead of the existing one year. Sebi decided on several amendments in IPO norms, which it stated in a press release.  Relaxed disclosure requirements  The board approved ways to reduce disclosure requirements during an IPO. The measures include rationalising the definition of the promoter group where the promoter of the issuer company is a corporate body to exclude companies that have the same financial investors. The board agreed to shift from the concept of a promoter to ‘person in control’ or ‘controlling shareholders.’  In addition, the disclosure requirements in the offer documents in respect of the issuer company’s group entities should be rationalised to exclude disclosure of the financials of the top 5 listed or unlisted group companies. These disclosures will continue to be made available on the website of the group companies.  IDs, InvITs, REITs; insider trading informant rewards - June 29  The regulator amended regulations for independent directors, changed the criteria for infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) and real estate investment trusts (REITs), and increased rewards for insider trading informants.  Appointing IDs  Appointments, reappointments, and removal of independent directors must be made through a special resolution of shareholders for all listed entities. Sebi elaborated on the appointment process of independent directors to be followed by the nomination and remuneration committee, ordering a modification in the committee. Several amendments mentioned in Sebi’s press release come into effect from January 1, 2022.  Relaxed REIT, InvIT rules  The board revised the minimum application value to be in the range of Rs 10,000-15,000 from Rs 1 lakh and its multiples previously and revised the trading lot to one unit for REITs and InvITS. It also relaxed norms for unlisted REITs and InvITs tapping the bond market.  Accredited investors  The board approved a proposal to introduce a framework for accredited investors, a class of investors who may be considered well-informed or well-advised about investment products.  Informant rewards  The regulator increased the reward amount payable to informants under insider-trading rules to Rs 10 crore from Rs 1 crore, a much-awaited decision as the earlier amount appeared ineffective.  Delisting rules, sustainability reporting, startups - March 25  Sebi approved a raft of measures, including making delisting of shares more transparent and efficient, requiring companies to disclose sustainability issues, and making the public offering of startups easier.  The regulator mandated the public disclosure of analyst calls, quick reporting of earnings, and expanded the requirement of setting up a risk management committee to the top 1,000 listed companies by market capitalisation from 500 listed entities previously.  Delisting norms  Under the new norms, a promoter or acquirer must disclose the intention to delist by making an initial public announcement. It introduced and revised timelines for various activities involved in delisting, the introduction of a committee of independent directors for recommendations, and the specification of an indicative delisting price not less than the floor price.  Innovators growth  Sebi cut the period for issuers to have 25 percent of pre-issue capital held by eligible investors from two years to one year, which was significant demand from startups.  Reclassification of promoters  The Sebi board acted on a long-pending demand of corporate houses. It changed the requirement of approval from shareholders in cases where the promoter seeking reclassification holds less than 1 percent of the shares, subject to the promoter not being in control.  The board introduced new requirements for sustainability reporting by listed entities. The new report will be called the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report and will replace the previous Business Responsibility Report. The new report will lay emphasis on quantifiable metrics, which allow for easy measurement and comparability across companies, sectors and time periods.  This report by Moneycontrol has details on Sebi’s decisions at the meeting.  Ease for large issues - February 17  Sebi took significant decisions at its first board meeting for 2021. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman customarily addressed the board after the budget presentation in Parliament.  Change in IPO norms  The regulator approved changes in the norms for IPOs to allow a smaller float for large companies. The board recommended that for issuers with a post-issue market capital exceeding Rs 1 lakh crore, the requirement of the minimum public offer will be cut from 10 percent of the post-issue market capital to Rs 10,000 crore plus 5 percent of the incremental amount beyond Rs 1 lakh crore.  These issuers must achieve at least 10 percent public shareholding in two years and at least 25 percent public shareholding within five years of listing.  As a result of amendments in IPO norms, the dilution requirement for post-issue capitalisation of over Rs 4,000 crore was lowered to 5 percent from 10 percent previously, as per Sebi’s press release.  Ease of doing business  To promote ease of doing business, Sebi approved the merger of the Regulatory Fee on Stock Exchanges Regulations, 2006, with the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2018.  Amending the regulations, the board noted that the post-graduate programme in equity markets of not less than one year offered by NISM is an eligible qualification for portfolio managers, investment advisers, and research analysts.  Budget announcements such as gold spot exchange, investor charter, and securities code were also discussed.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/the-year-in-review-sebis-notable-decisions-in-2021-7887121.html

In the December monetary policy, RBI decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 4 percent.  This was the ninth time in a row when the central bank decided to maintain the status quo on benchmark lending rate to support growth rate.  The bank has also revised the benchmark prime lending rate to 12.3 percent from 12.2 percent.

Currently, WhatsApp is allowed to onboard only 40 million UPI users as per NPCI's directions. ","Continuing its push to grow the usage of Unified Payment Interface (UPI) on its platform, WhatsApp India's head Abhijit Bose said that the instant messaging app can be instrumental in bringing the next 500 million users on UPI.  &quot;Adoption of digital payments for the first 100 million-plus people in UPI has been a global success story. We hope that WhatsApp can help take that story to the next level by helping onboard the next 500 million people, who are at the bottom of the pyramid and can benefit the most,&quot; Bose said speaking at the Digital Money conference by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI).  Currently, WhatsApp is allowed to onboard only 40 million UPI users and its share in monthly volumes remains at a minuscule 0.06 percent. However, since the Meta (erstwhile Facebook) owned company doubled down on growing its UPI user base, transaction volumes and values have been growing with every month.  The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) which is the umbrella organisation that handles UPI transactions allowed WhatsApp to increase its UPI user base cap from 20 million to 40 million only in November 2021. Moneycontrol was the first to report that NPCI will hike the cap in a phased manner.  WhatsApp's transactions consistently doubled in September and October after the company made its UPI feature more prominent in the app with a rupee icon in the chat composer and extended the feature to more users.  The instant messaging app has over 400 million users in India which is its largest market globally. Bose added that one of WhatsApp's key objectives is digitisation especially for small and medium businesses and other underserved sectors.  &quot;We can help scale financial inclusion, as people will be able to get access to microfinance digital banking services that they didn't have. For the first time in a long time, we as a society, have the ability to significantly democratise access (of financial services) in the economy through technology,&quot; he added.  Bose also spoke about how private, small finance and cooperative banks have deployed mobile banking services through WhatsApp.  &quot;In 2021, we have also seen growth in pilots that were launched. People can now access and purchase health insurance from State Bank of India (SBI), as well as sign up for micro pensions from the National Pension Scheme (NPS).&quot;  In a new service addition for the Indian market, ride-hailing firm Uber will allow users to book rides through WhatsApp. The company is launching the service this week starting with the city of Lucknow.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/whatsapp-can-help-onboard-next-500-million-users-on-upi-says-india-head-7785651.html

With Telr, Cashfree will develop a unified cross-border payments platform to help Indian merchants accept payments from customers in the MENA region and vice-versa.","Payments and online banking solutions company Cashfree Payments said on November 30 that it has made a $15 million investment in Telr, a Dubai-based payment service provider.  The investment makes Cashfree the largest shareholder in Telr and will help the company strengthen its presence in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region as the company sets out on a course to expand its presence in global markets.  In an interview with Moneycontrol, Akash Sinha, co-founder of Cashfree Payments said that what prompted this investment was the large and growing market opportunity that the MENA region offers with only two percent of retail sales happening online currently.  “The landscape for online transactions is changing fast after the pandemic. Plus, Telr already has a partnership with over eight banks. So, it made sense to join hands with Telr to try and become the top payment service provider in the MENA region in the coming years,” Sinha said.  Founded in 2015 by IIIT Hyderabad alumnus Sinha and IIT Kharagpur graduate Reeju Datta, Cashfree Payments processes transactions worth $20 billion annually in India. With over 1,00,000 merchants on its platform, the company’s offerings include payment gateway, a split payment solution for marketplaces, bank account verification Application Programming Interface (API) and Auto Collect which enables merchants to collect payments from customers via various payment modes.  In the payment gateway space, the Bengaluru-based company competes with players like PayU, Paytm, Razorpay among others.  With Telr, the company will launch its products in the MENA region and will also develop a unified cross-border payments platform to help Indian merchants accept payments from customers in the MENA region and vice-versa. Currently Cashfree products are already used in the UAE, besides USA and Canada.  “Usually geographical expansion for a company like ours will mean reworking our payments partners in the new markets. Our intention with this partnership is to integrate the cash flow here in India and make a seamless transition globally through the partnership. This saves us a lot of time and energy,” Sinha added.  Telr handles payments in over 120 currencies and 30 languages and enables payments through Visa, Mastercard, American Express, UnionPay, Apple Pay, PayPal, SADAD, Mada and STCPay.  Financial services play  Cashfree has also launched products for Banking As A Service (BaaS), i.e. it is providing an integrated interface that can serve as a common platform for upcoming neobanks to provide banking products from its partners to customers.  Telr’s offerings, too, cover financial and business services including social commerce, QR Codes, digital invoicing, Telr Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), a merchant financing platform named Telr Finance and Telr Shops, a tool for creating an online store.  “Cashfree too has a couple of lending products for merchants who use our payment solutions. We are working on a product which will allow merchants to take short-term loans from us which can be repaid within one to two months,” Sinha explained.  Funding plans  Cashfree Payments was incubated by California-headquartered online payments leader PayPal and is backed by Silicon Valley investor Y Combinator, Apis Partners and India’s largest public sector bank State Bank of India (SBI).  SBI made the investment in June this year with reports pegging Cashfree’s post-money valuation during the investment at $200 million.  “We are well-capitalised now. But we continue to be in active discussions for further funding. We will seek more funds at the right time,” Sinha said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/cashfree-payments-invests-15-million-in-uae-based-payment-gateway-telr-7773961.html

According to a report prepared by IIT Bombay Professor Ashish Das, the SBI has refunded only Rs 90 crore so far out of the transaction fee levied on account holders of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) scheme.

Further, up to four cash withdrawals in a month are free. Fully free digital transactions and four free cash withdrawals are enabling these customers to meet all their banking requirements,&quot; it said.

The bail comes over a week after Chaudhuri was sent to a 14-day judicial custody in connection with the case which involves the sale of a hotel belonging to the Godawan Group in Jaisalmer -- which is a non-performing asset (NPA) -- to Alchemist ARC in an alleged fraudulent manner.  Chaudhuri's plea seeking bail was heard by Additional District and Sessions Judge Dalpat Singh Rajpurohit.  The former banker had been arrested on October 31 from his residence in Delhi. The case against him was registered in 2015 for seizing the hotel property in a loan settlement case and allegedly selling it at a throwaway price.  Chaudhuri later became a director on the board of Alchemist ARC, the company which purchased the hotel, the prosecution said.  Notably, the ex-SBI chief was taken into arrest following a petition filed by former directors of the hotel property with the Chief Judicial Magistrate - Jaisalmer.  The ex-directors accused him of facilitating the sale of the Rs 200-crore property at a price of Rs 25 crore to Alchemist ARC, after the SBI had seized the hotel following a default on loan.  The petitioners claimed that the Godawan properties’ NPA was assigned to Alchemist Asset Reconstruction Company in 2014, six months after Chaudhuri resigned as the SBI chairman and joined the board of Alchemist ARC.  Refuting claims of cutting a sweetheart deal, the SBI has said in a statement that due process as per the bank’s policy was followed during the NPA loan account sale to Alchemist ARC. “It appears from the copies of the proceedings now accessed by us that there have been some factual inaccuracies in the complainant’s version submitted to the Hon’ble court,” the bank said.  It further stated that the ‘Garh Rajwada’ hotel in Jaisalmer, which was financed by the SBI in 2007, had remained incomplete for more than three years.

SBI,2021-11-03T16:39:11+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Arrest of Pratip Chaudhari is extremely unfortunate: SBI Chairman Khara,Former SBI Chairman Pratip Chaudhari was arrested by Jaisalmer Police on November 1,"State Bank of India’s Chairman, Dinesh Kumar Khara, on November 3 termed the the recent arrest of former SBI Chairman Pratip Chaudhari as &quot;extremely unfortunate&quot;.  Several people from the banking community, including previous chiefs of the bank, have made their reactions public, Khara said while addressing the media after the bank's quarterly results announcement.  &quot;It appears that he was not given an opportunity to be heard before issuing the arrest warrant,&quot; Khara said.  Chaudhari was arrested by Jaisalmer Police on Sunday in a case associated with Gaudavan Group and Alchemist ARC. The group had taken a loan of Rs 24 crore to construct a new hotel. According to a TOI report, allegations against Chaudhuri included facilitating the sale of properties worth Rs 200 crore for Rs 25 crore to the ARC, after the bank seized them for defaulting on loan.  The SBI in a recent statement had said that there were factual inaccuracies in the complaint lodged against the former chairman.  Khara added that the bank has utmost faith in the country's judicial system and is confident that Chaudhari will be released unconditionally.  The banking community through IBA has taken up the matter with government authorities and it hopes that this matter will resolved soon, he said.  &quot;As far as SBI is concerned, we adhere to best practices in corporate governance,&quot; Khara said.  Khara added that, as far as the bank is concerned, there has been no irregularity in the said case, and that all prescribed rules and processes were followed by the bank.  Issues of this magnitude are invariably dealt with at the local level, and top management of the bank including the chairman isn’t involved in the decision making.  &quot;As we have got a structure in place, we are confident that all our people across the hierarchy can take decisions,&quot; Khara added.  The arrest of the former SBI chairman had drawn reactions from former SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar and veteran banker Uday Kotak, among others.  Kumar in an exclusive chat to Moneycontrol had said “This seems to be a case of highly motivated, high-handed action. This seems to be an error of judgment. There is a due process and set of rules laid out by the RBI for the sale of assets to ARCs. Where is the corruption here?”  Uday Kotak, on November 2, said that we really need to have a criminal justice system that protects bonafide actions by bankers for recovery of their money.

SBI,2021-10-24T20:11:29+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Book excerpt | What really happened at Jet Airways: A banker's perspective,"In 'The Custodian of Trust', former SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar shows how bankers sometimes get a ringside view of the most spectacular corporate implosions of our times.","The rise of Jet Airways symbolized a remarkable achievement for its promoter, Naresh Goyal, an erstwhile travel agent with an affable personality, who had made it big in the airline business through the sheer dint of his enterprise and hard work. Way back in 2010 or 2011, when I was heading the UK Operations of SBI, I had come across both Vijay Mallya and Naresh Goyal at a social event in London. The two were contrasting personalities—one was rich, flamboyant, and ostentatious while the other was a low-profile businessman, perhaps not highly educated but a very amicable person. In fact, looking at him, one could hardly believe that he was the man instrumental in creating such a successful airline in terms of both adroit branding and high-quality service. I have flown almost all major airlines across the globe, and found Jet to be a perfect match for many of the best international airlines like Emirates, Korean Air of South Korea, Lufthansa, and Singapore Airlines. For Indians, Jet offered another unique selling proposition—a familiar and comfortable environment stemming from its typical ‘Indianness’. However, I soon learnt that trouble was brewing in this apparent paradise.  From the archive: Jet Airways employees write to SBI, offer to take over airline  The Beginning of the End for Jet Airways  In the middle of 2019, Naresh Goyal and one of the topmost investment bankers hired by Jet Airways reached out to SBI for sanction of additional loans. The loans were to be secured by the pledge of shares of JP Miles, a frequent flyer programme being offered by the airline but which was managed by a separate company that Jet jointly owned with Etihad Airways. The valuation being talked about for this financial deal was in excess of US$1 billion. While Jet was holding shares worth 49.9 per cent, the remaining 51.1 per cent were held by Etihad. It was obvious that Jet was facing shortage of working capital funds. My first intuitive reaction was that SBI should stay away from Jet’s woes rather than enter into its messy financial waters. My perception seemed justified as subsequently many issues unfolded with regard to the valuation of Jet Privilege Private Limited pertaining to JP Miles, being closely held as also because its valuation would be inextricably linked with the performance of Jet Airways.  Another proposal suggested for resolving the issue was that of financing against six Boeing 777, three Boeing 737 and three Airbus planes owned by Jet. Since SBI had no experience of financing aircraft, this proposal too could not be carried further and the company was advised to explore funding from other banks that had some understanding of financing aircraft. Meanwhile, the financial problems being faced by the company became more and more evident. The investment bankers concerned had probably underestimated the common sense and intelligence of officials at public sector banks, who were assumed to provide assistance without giving much thought to the issue.  From the archive: Jet Airways insolvency: All eyes on banks as they begin voting on the two bids  Word of trouble at Jet Airways soon spread in the public domain. Jet’s problems had started with the acquisition of Sahara Airlines, as a result of which it ended up managing two brands for many years, one of which was a premium full-service carrier while the other was a budget airline that had somehow diluted the original Jet brand. The company was thus falling apart because of its inability to compete with budget airlines, and Indigo had rapidly started capturing the market share. There was huge pressure on the revenue per seat kilometre for Jet whereas its cost per seat kilometre was substantially higher that of other budget airlines. Governance at Jet was reportedly poor amid allegations that the CEO and the management were not being given due authority to run the airline professionally.  From the archive: PMO, FinMin and SBI in a huddle as Jet Airways hits deep air pocket  Mistrust between Partners  Later on, I realized that the bigger problem, which had beset the company, was a complete lack of trust between the two partners, Jet and Etihad. In 2013, Jet had brought in Etihad as a joint venture partner with a 24 per cent stake. Further, it sold a 50.1 per cent stake in Jet Privilege to Etihad, and went on to sell its three slots at Heathrow Airport in London, with the right to buy them back after three years for US$70 million. Etihad had arranged funding from one of the bankers of Etihad, which was to be reportedly secured by pledging shares held by Jet Airways. In hindsight, it appeared, at least to me, that Naresh Goyal had got a raw deal and had effectively mortgaged the interest of Jet Airways, considering that the agreement between Etihad and Jet Airways had opened up a huge and attractive market of Indian flyers for global players like Etihad by an increase in its revenue. As the obvious mistrust between the two partners became public knowledge, it started becoming evident that one of the major irritants was the non-perfection of security on the shares of Jet Airways. Etihad had guaranteed its repayment. Under the rules, foreigners are not allowed to hold more than a 49 per cent share in an airline, and it was not clear if this rule applied to the Jet Privilege wherein Etihad had a 50.1 per cent stake. Since no clarification on the issue came from the MoCA, Etihad started believing that Naresh Goyal was using his influence with MoCA to prevent it from issuing the clarification.  Tony Douglas, the CEO of Etihad, flew down to Mumbai in October 2018, after Naresh Goyal had met me. The visit by Douglas underscored the seriousness of the situation. Jet was fast running out of cash and hurtling towards an imminent shutdown unless a major infusion of cash happened. Tony wanted SBI to invest in Jet Privilege, against security of Jet’s shareholding in Jet Privilege, following which Etihad was willing to take over the operations without any financial commitment in case of an emergency.

The violation is related to rules pertaining to frauds classification and reporting by commercial banks and select financial institutions, the RBI said.  This action is based on the deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers, the central bank said in a release.  The RBI conducted scrutiny of the bank in a customer account maintained with the bank and the examination of the scrutiny report revealed non-compliance with the directions on reporting of fraud in the said account to RBI, the central bank said.  “In furtherance to the same, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause why penalty should not be imposed on it for such non-compliance with the said directions,” the RBI said.  After considering SBI’s reply, the RBI came to the conclusion that the charge of non-compliance with the aforesaid RBI directions was substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty, the RBI said.  Earlier, the RBI announced a fine of Rs 1.95 crore on the Standard Chartered Bank for failing to report a cyber security incident within the prescribed time period, and failure to credit the amount involved in unauthorised electronic transactions, among other reasons.  Listing the reasons behind the move, the RBI said in a release that it imposed a penalty of Rs 1.95 crore on the Standard Chartered Bank over non-compliance with the directions issued by it regarding “customer protection”.  The RBI’s enforcement operations are conducted by the Enforcement Department. The RBI’s EFD was set up in April 2017 to separate enforcement action from the supervisory process. EFD identifies actionable violations from the inspection reports, risk assessment reports, and scrutiny reports.  Market intelligence reports, references from the top management, and complaints are also used for investigation. An Adjudication Committee then adjudicates the violations and determines the quantum of the penalty.  The penalty thus imposed would be disclosed by RBI in the form of a press release and by the regulated entity as per the disclosure norms. The regulated entity will then be required to pay the penalty within a specific period.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rbi-imposes-rs-1-crore-penalty-on-state-bank-of-india-7595621.html

The need is for at least four-five more SBI-sized banks,&quot; Sitharaman said while speaking at the 74th Annual General Meeting of Indian Banks' Association in Mumbai.  A larger number of lenders, particularly the big-sized banks, will aid in the path of making a smart recovery post-pandemic disruptions, she added.  Sitharaman said there was an urgent need to scale up banking to not only meet the growing needs of the industry, but also to ensure that all economic centres of the country are covered with at least one physical or digital banking presence.  The finance minister referred to the amalgamation exercise among public sector banks, which, she said, have helped in moving ahead with the creation of large banks.  Having done two rounds of bank consolidation earlier, the central government in 2019 decided to merge six disparate and weak PSBs into four in one stroke.  Accordingly, Punjab National Bank (PNB) took over Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India; Allahabad Bank became part of Indian Bank; Canara Bank subsumed Syndicate Bank; and Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank merged with Union Bank of India. Earlier, State Bank of India (SBI) merged five of its associate banks with itself while Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank were merged with Bank of Baroda.  Sitharaman lauded the efforts of the PSBs to see through that the amalgamation of banks during the pandemic period was completed without any inconvenience to customers.  She said that in the post-pandemic world, banks would need to change their mindset and the way they conduct their businesses.  Digitisation, the finance minister said has changed a lot of how businesses are done and banks will now need to think futuristically and keep pace with evolving technology.  Sitharaman also asked the IBA to conduct a digitised mapping of each district of the country with regard to the presence of bank branch operation and their location. This, she said, would help to plug areas of gaps with no banking presence effectively.  &quot;Not necessary to have physical banking presence everywhere. The country's optic fibre network has covered two-third of about 7.5 lakh panchayats. This could be used to deliver banking services in unconnected areas as well,&quot; the finance minister said.  She also asked banks to develop models and better understanding of businesses focused on exports as the country has set a $2 trillion export target by 2030.  With regard to funding for the infra sector, she said that a government sector development financial institution (DFI) is coming up soon.  Sitharaman said that the Indian economy is at a critical stage of a reset and banks would form the backbone for it by providing best of the financial services.

On Thursday, the country's largest lender State Bank of India announced various festive offers for prospective home loan customers, including a credit score-linked home loan starting at 6.70 per cent, irrespective of the loan amount. Earlier, a borrower availing a home loan above Rs 75 lakh had to pay an interest rate of 7.15 per cent.  ALSO READ: SBI to offer home loans at 6.70% irrespective of the loan amount  Anarock group Chairman Anuj Puri said: &quot;This is an extremely competitive move by SBI, and it virtually negates all the previous limitations which applied to special home loan interest rates. Instead of focussing on just budget housing, this new interest rate is genuinely democratic as buyers from any budget bandwidth will benefit.&quot; Puri termed the SBI's decision as &quot;aptly timed&quot; ahead of the festive season.  &quot;This year, we are likely to see significantly improved traction in the housing segment during this period. Waiving of processing fees and occupation-linked interest premium are added levels of savings,&quot; he said. Puri expected other lenders to follow SBI's footsteps in order to remain competitive.  Vikas Wadhawan, Group CFO, Housing.com, Makaan.com and Proptiger.com, said the reduction in home loan interest rates by SBI will help the sector gain further momentum. &quot;Prices are already subdued and buyers will be able to save a little more money,&quot; he added.  Amit Goyal, CEO, India Sotheby's International Realty, said the rate cut by some of the country's leading banks will act as a catalyst for faster decisions. &quot;SBI decision to offer lower interest rate irrespective of the prices of the unit or loan amount is likely to benefit buyers in the luxury segment as well. Given the upcoming festive season, which is considered auspicious by a large number of Indians to make big-ticket purchases, the timing of reduction in interest rate couldn't have been better,&quot; he added.  Raoul Kapoor, COO Andromeda, said the reduction in interest rates by major banks is expected to give a boost to the resurgent real estate market, especially during the busy festive season. Signature Global founder and chairman Pradeep Aggarwal said: &quot;The market is already on the up, and we expect that the recent decision by the SBI will help turn the table and lead to a substantial increase in sales.&quot;  Nayan Raheja, Executive Director, Raheja Developers, said the demand for affordable and mid-segment houses will go up as affordability improves. &quot;This will be a double dose of benefit for buyers as developers have already kept the prices on a leash, even though construction cost is going up,&quot; Raheja added.  Noida-based ABA Corp Director Amit Modi hoped that other private and public sector banks would also announce similar initiatives to revive the market confidence. &quot;The market has already started seeing sales increase post-May 2021, and the home loan interest rate reduction will further boost the buying sentiment. We are looking forward to a faster recovery and hope the measure will expedite the sector to reach pre-COVID levels sooner than expected,&quot; he added.  Gurugram-based Silverglades group CEO Anubhav Jain said the SBI has set a trend for reducing home loan rates by reducing lending rate to as low as 6.7 per cent. This would go a long way in giving a boost to the real estate sector in the upcoming festive season, he added.  &quot;Home buyers will be entitled to get home loans at 6.7 per cent irrespective of the amount of loan. Earlier, people seeking home loans over Rs 75 lakhs were required to pay comparatively higher rates. Also the decision to do away with distinction between salaried and non-salaried is welcome and makes the whole process simpler and transparent,&quot; Jain said. With the introduction of the new offer by the SBI, a borrower can now avail home loan for any amount at a rate as low as 6.70 per cent.  This will result in a saving of 45 basis points (bps) which translates to an interest saving of more than Rs 8 lakh, for a Rs 75 lakh loan with a 30-year tenure, SBI said. Further, the rate of interest applicable for a non-salaried home borrower was 15 bps higher than the interest rate applicable to a salaried borrower. The lender has removed this distinction between a salaried and a non-salaried borrower.  Now, there is no occupation-linked interest premium being charged to prospective home loan borrowers, the bank had said. Recently, Anarock issued its estimates of housing sales for the current calendar year, projecting 30 per cent increase in demand across seven major cities to nearly 1.8 lakh units in 2021.

Outlook not positive  Although electricity demand in India is estimated to grow 6 percent in FY22 on the back of a pick-up in economic activity and the relatively lower impact of the second wave of the pandemic, the outlook for thermal power generation has not yet turned positive, ICRA said.  “This is partly due to subdued thermal plant load factor, in some cases PPAs are not signed at all or are for short term, modest tariffs and continued delays in receiving payments,” said Sabyasachi Majumdar, group head and senior vice president at ICRA, a unit of Moody’s Investors Service.  On the positive side, the liquidity situation of some independent power producers has improved due to payments made under the liquidity support scheme by the Centre in March 2021, he said.  “Under the given circumstances, if investors are queuing up for such distressed assets, it is more likely to be driven by expectations of favourable valuations during acquisitions,” said Majumdar.  No buyer  Coastal Energen, an unlisted company promoted by the Ahmed Buhari family, operates two coal-based power units of 600 MW each in Tamil Nadu. It had Rs 7,794 crore of outstanding loans, according to a report by ICRA in May. The Buhari family and associates own 49 percent of the company. The remainder is held by lenders that invoked pledged shares in 2015 following a default in loan payments.  One power unit, which imports coal, has a 15-year supply agreement with a distribution company while the other is yet to find a buyer.  Delayed payments from Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation and the absence of a buyer for power from the second unit led to a stretched liquidity position, according to the ICR report.  Early this year, Buhari approached lenders with an offer to settle the company’s loan in partnership with Deutsche Bank and Ares SSG Capital, but the talks did not progress because the promoter did not make a binding offer, the first person said.  In 2019, a consortium of Deutsche Bank, Ares SSG Capital and the Buhari family offered Rs 3,000 crore to acquire the 51 percent stake held by the lenders and the entire debt of the company. The deal, which was conditional on all lenders agreeing, equated to 38 paise to a rupee, the person said. The promoter had even deposited Rs 150 crore, 50 percent of his contribution, with SBI, the person said.  However, the transaction did not close – initially due to a delay in getting approval from all the lenders. By the time all the lenders agreed to the proposal in March 2020, the Enforcement Directorate started investigating the company for money laundering and froze the company’s assets, the person said.  Before this, in 2018, a proposed offer by Deutsche Bank and Edelweiss ARC to jointly acquire the company’s debt and the lenders’ 51 percent stake for Rs 3,200 crore fell apart after the lenders declined to relinquish their entire stake, a second person said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/aditya-birla-kotak-backed-arcs-among-12-interested-in-rs-1597-crore-sbi-loan-to-coastal-energen-7473601.html

An Indian court last year ordered the mobile carrier, a joint venture between the Indian unit of Britain's Vodafone Group and Aditya Birla Group's Idea Cellular, to pay just over $8 billion to the government to settle long-standing dues. Vodafone has a stake of about 44 percent in the company and Aditya Birla owns nearly 27 percent.  In June, Vodafone Idea's then non-executive chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla warned that without a government reprieve the Indian mobile carrier's &quot;financial situation will drive its operations to an irretrievable point of collapse&quot;.  Vodafone Idea's gross debt as of June 30 was 1.9 trillion rupees, comprising of deferred spectrum payment obligations of 1.06 trillion rupees and an adjusted gross revenue liability of 621.8 billion rupees, its latest stock exchange filing in June showed.  The adjusted gross revenue is the usage and licensing fee that telecom operators are charged by the Indian government.  The mobile operator also reported that it owes 234 billion Indian rupees ($3.18 billion) to financial institutions.  Senior SBI officials and representatives of the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) met finance and telecom department officials this month and proposed an immediate breather on the repayment of spectrum dues, the two bankers and the government official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters.  &quot;We've had these discussions with the banks but the issue is the finance ministry needs to be comfortable with the measures,&quot; the government official said.  SBI, IBA, and the finance and telecom departments did not respond to Reuters requests seeking comment.  The company is facing a repayment of 5-10 billion rupees of non-convertible debentures around January, one of the bankers said.  Vodafone Idea declined to comment. Vodafone Group did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment. An Aditya Birla Group spokesman declined to comment.  Vodafone Idea had cash and cash equivalents of 9.2 billion rupees at the end of June, a transcript of a company conference call published on its website said.  &quot;All eyes are on New Delhi right now as banks are getting increasingly nervous,&quot; another banker with exposure to Vodafone Idea said.  The bankers have also proposed providing some relief to Vodafone by restructuring its dues, one government official and two bankers said.  Birla stepped down as chairman early last month after appealing for the government bailout.  The government has been considering a broader package to help a telecom industry disrupted by the 2016 entry of Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Jio, which shook up the market with its free voice and cut-price data plans.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks-call-on-government-to-ease-pressure-on-debt-laden-vodafone-idea-7462841.html

The company, which operates a 20 million tonnes a year refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat, is setting up a 450 kilo tonnes per annum polypropylene plant at the refinery to mark its foray into petrochemicals business.  &quot;The company signed a financial agreement with a consortium of banks led by State Bank of India for a project term loan of Rs 4,016 crore,&quot; the company said in a statement.  For the proposed project, it is already in possession of required land.

SBI,2021-08-04T18:44:19+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan,Analysis | SBI gives no negative surprises in Q1,SBI has logged steady numbers in Q1 in a tough market. Slippages remained high but that is largely in line with the industry trend. ,"In a challenging market environment, the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI) has delivered a strong set of numbers in the April-June quarter. The asset quality numbers remain at elevated levels yet the trend is in line with the industry.  “No negative should be taken as positive in this environment,” said Sidhharth Purohit, research analyst at Mumbai-based SMC Global Securities. “Incremental stress built up is not very high. Slippages are also on the expected line. Provision Coverage Ratio is down quarter-on-quarter but still close to 70 percent. So very low risk from any likely third wave (sic),” said Purohit.  What has happened on the bad loan segment? Let's take a look at the numbers.  SBI’s gross non-performing assets (GNPA) numbers came at 5.32 percent compared with 4.98 percent in the preceding quarter. But, if one looks at the incremental slippages, during the quarter the bank reported fresh slippages of Rs 15,666 crore compared with Rs 21,934 crore in the preceding quarter. The bank approved loans worth Rs 5,246 crore for the second round of restructuring and has pending applications for Rs 2,056 crore.  Clearly, the State Bank has not escaped the second wave impact. It is seeing pressure on the asset quality. Still, the numbers are in line with some of its closer rivals. For instance, the numbers of Axis Bank, released on July 26, were the latest to confirm the larger trend. The bank’s GNPAs and net NPAs in the April-June quarter rose to 3.85 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively, against the GNPA and NNPA ratio of 3.7 percent and 1.05 percent in the previous quarter.  The same is the case with Kotak Mahindra Bank. The gross NPAs stood at 3.56 percent against 3.25 percent on a sequential basis whereas the net NPA came at 1.28 percent from 1.21 percent. These numbers are in line with the trend shown by other banks—HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and big NBFCs such as Bajaj Finance (auto loan NPAs of 19.15 percent against 9.31 percent in the March quarter of FY 2021 and just 5.8 percent in the year-ago period), L&amp;amp;T Finance and M&amp;amp;M Finance (where GNPAs rose to 15.5 percent against 9 percent last year).  Of the Rs 15,666 crore fresh NPA additions in Q1, Rs 6,416 crore is from small and medium enterprises book. Loan growth is muted across segments. Domestic credit growth was at 5.64 percent YoY, mainly driven by retail (personal) advances (16.47 percent YoY), agri advances (2.48 percent YoY) and SME (2.01 percent YoY), the bank said.  The profit was higher than Street’s expectations. A CNBC-TV18 poll of analysts had estimated Q1 profit at Rs 6,374.5 crore. SBI's operating profit increased by 5.06 percent to Rs 18,975 crore in the quarter from Rs 18,061 crore in the year-ago period. The operating profit, excluding exceptional items, increased 14.85 percent.   Net interest income (NII), the difference between the interest income from lending activities and the interest paid to depositors, grew 3.74 percent YoY. The net interest margin (NIM) for the quarter stood at 3.15 percent. The domestic net interest margin (NIM) for Q1FY22 came at 3.15 percent, which was lower by 9 bps YoY.  The numbers are largely in line with analyst expectations. &quot;Risk reward is favourable for the stock now,&quot; said Purohit of SMC Global. However, just like for other banks, SBI’s performance going ahead will depend on the COVID environment and the pace of vaccinations. The next few quarters should offer a clearer pattern.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/analysis-sbi-gives-no-negative-surprises-in-q1-7277271.html

Cybersecurity researchers have warned that hackers are asking customers to update their KYC using a particular website link and luring them with free gifts worth Rs 50 lakh via a WhatsApp message.  The research wing of New Delhi-based think tank CyberPeace Foundation, along with Autobot Infosec Pvt Ltd, studied two such incidents faced by some smartphone users, IANS reported.  Read: Hackers hit SBI users with text phishing scam, request them to redeem credit points worth Rs 9,870  In the first case of the text message requesting KYC verification, the landing page resembled the official SBI online page.  &quot;It then asks for the OTP sent to the user's mobile number. As soon as the OTP is entered, it redirects the user to another page that asks the users to enter some confidential information again like account holder name, mobile number, date of birth. After entering the data, it redirects the user to an OTP page,&quot; the researchers said, as quoted by IANS.  On clicking the &quot;Continue to Login&quot; button, it redirects the user to the full-kyc.php page, asking for confidential information like username, password and a captcha in order to log in to the online banking.  &quot;All the domain names associated with the campaign have the registrant country as China,&quot; the research team said.  The research team concluded that the campaign pretended to be launched from the State Bank of India, is hosted on the third-party domain instead of the official website www.onlinesbi.com.  The overall layout of the web page used in the campaign is kept similar to the official SBI net banking site to convince the users.  In the second instance of fraud, users were promised attractive free gifts. The team found that the WhatsApp message also redirects the user to another link.  &quot;On the landing page, a congratulations message appears with a photo of State Bank of India and asks users to participate in a quick survey to get a free gift of Rs 50 lakh from the State bank of India,&quot; the researchers informed.  At the bottom of the page, a section appears which seems to be a Facebook comment section where many users have commented about how the offer is beneficial.  &quot;The URL manipulation showed that the webserver has directory listing enabled and found other links visible which proves that not only the SBI users, IDFC, PNB, IndusInd and Kotak bank users are also targeted by the same type of phishing scam,&quot; the team noted.  In March this year, the same research team had pointed out that several users of the SBI were targeted in a phishing scam where hackers flooded them with suspicious text messages, requesting them to redeem their SBI credit points worth Rs 9,870.
