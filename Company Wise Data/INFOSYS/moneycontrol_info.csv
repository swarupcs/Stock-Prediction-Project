On March 31, the company had said it faces a significant tax liability of Rs 2,763 crore, according to assessment orders.  India’s second-largest software services provider informed the exchanges on May 2 that it does not expect any impact on the financial statement from such rectification.  In the March order, the Bengaluru-based company had also said it is set to receive a tax refund of Rs 6,329 crore from the income tax department. These orders are as per various sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961.  In financial year 2023-24, the company reported consolidated income tax expenses of Rs 9,740 crore, compared to Rs 7,214 crore in the previous fiscal year.  In the March 30 order, Infosys said the impact of these orders isn’t limited to the parent company; its subsidiaries have also been served assessment orders by the income tax department. These orders collectively entail a tax demand of Rs 277 crore, inclusive of interest, for assessment years spanning 2018-19 and 2021-23.  Infosys had said it was evaluating the implications of these orders on its financial statements and also “evaluating filing appeals against these orders.”  Also read: Infosys Q4 FY24: Disappointing quarter, attractive valuation",https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/infosys-tax-liability-reduced-by-over-rs-1200-cr-to-rs-1505-cr-article-12713452.html
infosys,2024-04-29T14:11:39+05:30,Reshab Shaw,CEOs of IT companies expect mixed bag in FY25 after weak show last year,"While TCS and Tech Mahindra say the current financial year will be better than the last one, Infosys and HCLTech expect it will be similar.","While financial year 2024 ended with subdued performances across the board, the CEOs of leading IT companies have expressed varied sentiments on the outlook for fiscal year 2025 (FY25).  Analysts say the performance of the mass employment-generating and high-growth sector in FY24 has been one of the most lacklustre in recent memory. They believe this might not change drastically in the next year or so, as companies struggle with dwindling growth amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment.  While TCS and Tech Mahindra say the current financial year will be better than the last one, Infosys and HCLTech say it will be similar.  Here’s the outlook from the top bosses of leading IT companies for the financial year 2024-25.  TCS Sector behemoth TCS remains cautiously optimistic about FY25. This financial year should be better than FY24, said CEO K Krithivasan, addressing the media after declaring the results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Nevertheless, the Mumbai-headquartered firm said it would not hazard a guess on when growth will return in FY25.  Also read: There is a greater opportunity to increase pricing: TCS CEO K Krithivasan  Even if the company’s revenue betters its FY24 numbers, which grew a mere 6.8 percent YoY to Rs 2,40,893 crore, it would still be far behind the FY23 growth of 17.6 percent. Brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects TCS to record 8.8 percent year-on-year growth in FY25.  Discretionary spending is yet to pick up for IT companies as clients tighten their purse strings during uncertain macroeconomic situations. “Clients want to do transformative work, and they want to embrace new technology. Clients want to do all of them, and clients also want to conserve costs,” Krithivasan said.  Motilal Oswal Financial Services said it continues to expect the Tata Group company to benefit from the large BSNL deal execution in FY25. “But continued uncertainty on growth pickup in North America and Europe is likely to weigh on overall growth,” it said.  Infosys  On the other hand, India’s second-largest IT firm Infosys expects FY25 trends to be similar to FY24. Discretionary spending and digital transformation projects were weak in FY24 and Infosys sees them remaining at the same level. It also sees a persistent focus on cost efficiency and consolidation deals, which usually land with top IT firms.  On client budgets, the Salil Parekh-led firm said trends seem to be similar for digital work or discretionary work. “Nothing seems to have changed… between March and April or as you look out into this financial year,” Parekh said on April 18, while speaking to analysts after declaring the company’s fourth-quarter earnings.  However, Parekh said some industries, such as financial services, are showing signs of improved spending, while manufacturing faces a slower growth trajectory. The trends are different for different industry groupings, the Bengaluru-based company said.  Infosys has slashed its revenue guidance for the fiscal 2025 to 1-3 percent as weakness continued in discretionary and digital projects. It has revised its annual revenue growth guidance five times in the previous five quarters, amid an uncertain demand environment.  Brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities said the improvement in revenue will be facilitated by large and mega deal revenue contributions and slower pace of ramp-downs in the existing business. “Guidance (of 1-3 percent) is front-ended, in our view,” wrote analysts Kawaljeet Saluja, Sathishkumar S, and Vamshi Krishna in the report.  Also read: Clients willing to have pricing discussions due to onsite inflation, says Infosys CFO  HCLTech  Meanwhile, India’s third-largest IT services firm, HCLTech, is bracing for a potential revenue reduction as it transitions certain large deals into a global delivery model in FY25.  “As we get into FY25, some of the large deals that we won will move into a global delivery model and that will have some reduction in revenue. Our assumption is (we) will continue to (see) similar (revenue growth) to what we saw in FY24,” said HCLTech CEO C Vijayakumar.  HCLTech slashed its constant currency revenue growth guidance for FY25 in the range of 3-5 percent, down from 5-5.5 percent guided for FY24. To be fair, among IT companies that disclose revenue guidance, HCLTech boasts the highest projection.  In a research note, brokerage Nomura said the first half of FY25 is likely to be soft for the Vijayakumar-led company. The management highlighted that annual productivity benefits to clients on renewals and offshoring of a large contract will lead to around a 2 percent sequential decline in April-June.  Also read: FY25 guidance of 3-5% good growth in current environment: HCLTech CEO  Tech Mahindra  Nevertheless, Tech Mahindra anticipates a better performance in FY25. “As we step in to FY25, we believe this year will be better than the previous year in a world of heightened political turmoil, coupled with fast-evolving AI capabilities,” said CEO Mohit Joshi, after declaring the March quarter earnings.  Joshi added that organisations will have to either address and adapt or defend and insulate their businesses like never before. The company also unveiled a 3-year plan with granular details, which also said FY25 is likely to be a turnaround year.  Brokerages say Tech Mahindra appears to be addressing client-specific engagement issues within various verticals, while maintaining a robust deal pipeline. “However, the demand scenario remains uncertain and may lead to lower revenue growth momentum in the near term,” said Axis Securities, in a note.  Wipro  On April 19, Wipro’s new CEO Srinivas Pallia outlined five key focus areas to turn the company around, amidst tepid market demand as well as the company's enduring challenges, which have resulted in a continual decline in its market share.  For the quarter ending June 30, the company has guided for sequential revenue growth of (-) 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent in constant currency terms. Most analysts had expected Wipro’s guidance range to hover between 0 percent and 2 percent sequentially.  Brokerage Kotak said several indicators point to a tough FY25 for Wipro, such as weak growth guidance, the lack of sufficient new deals, a broad-based underperformance in comparison with its peers, a patchy track record in account management, and the loss of several senior leaders.  “Srini needs to keep the remaining flock together, including those hired under Thierry (Delaporte). We expect flat revenue in FY2025,” the brokerage said in a note.  As the IT sector braces for FY25, the Street is keenly watching to see how the top IT companies execute and perform amid tough macroeconomic conditions.

infosys,2024-04-27T12:02:12+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,"Top 5 Indian IT services companies saw a decline of 69,167 employees in FY24","Four out of the five top IT companies including TCS, Infosys, Wipro and Tech Mahindra lost employees both sequentially in Q4 and full year FY24. HCLTech bucked the trend.","Top five Indian IT services giants including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra together lost around 69,167 employees in the fiscal year 2024, amidst an uncertain demand environment.  To be sure, HCLTech was the only company among these to have added employees both in the fourth quarter ended March 31 and the full year FY24.  This would be the first time in at least the last five fiscal years that the IT services companies have reported an overall decrease in full-year employee addition.  For the full year FY24, TCS’ headcount was down by 13,249, Infosys’ headcount dropped by 25,994, while Wipro added 24,516 fewer employees in FY24. Tech Mahindra, which reported its earnings on April 25, saw its headcount drop by 6,945.  HCLTech, instead, saw a net addition of about 1,537 employees in FY24, though it’s still a small number.  As of Q4, TCS’ employee addition dropped by 1,759, Infosys’ headcount plunged 5,423, Wipro’s headcount decreased by 6,180 and Tech Mahindra’s net addition was down by 795. HCLTech added 2,725 employees on the contrary.  Analysts said this is largely due to the lack of growth seen in FY24, which made companies shift to focus on improving margins and utilisation rate instead.    Pareekh Jain, founder of EIIRTrend said, “Since the growth was not happening in FY24, the companies were more focussed on improving margins which led to lower hiring. Once the growth is back, headcount will start increasing. Also, with generative AI coming in, companies might not even require that many employees, and we will see more just-in-time hiring depending on the requirement.”  According to Gaurav Vasu, founder of market intelligence firm UnearthInsight, headcount decline was on the expected lines.  “We believe industry headcount will get stagnated over the next two to three years. Due to de-growth, the companies will continue to focus on generative AI, improving utilisation etc. The 5.4 million industry headcount will remain around the same lines for at least the next one or two years for sure. Our goal of reaching 10 million headcount in the technology industry looks very difficult for now,” he told Moneycontrol.  Vasu added, “With generative AI transformation coming in, we expect headcount to stagnate at 6-6.5 million by 2030.”  What companies said  While Infosys and Wipro shied away from sharing exact fresher hiring targets for FY25 saying that the companies are seeing a shift in traditional hiring models especially freshers, TCS will be adding about 40,000 freshers, HCLTech is adding over 10,000 freshers and Tech Mahindra will be hiring 6,000 freshers respectively.  All the companies have reported strong deal pipelines in Q4, yet there seems to be a divergence happening between deal wins and employee addition.  Explaining this, TCS CEO and MD K Krithivasan in an interview with Moneycontrol said, “We look at the trainees we deploy, we put them through our own internal training mechanisms and maybe after a period of 6 to 8 months, they become productive and billable. So, there will always be a lag.”  Infosys CFO Jayesh Sanghrajka said, &quot;We have changed our hiring model significantly. We no more hire all the freshers from campus. We hire less than half of them from campus and more than half of them off campus.&quot;  According to Saurabh Govil, CHRO at Wipro, campus hiring is a combination of looking at demand, utilisation and when the hiring is going to happen.  “We have significantly improved our utilisation this quarter, it’s an all-time high. We hope to increase and sustain that. We have been able to reduce our bench which was there and deploy people faster,” he said.  “The year before last there was huge demand, so post Covid, we went to the campuses and made large number of offers. We are still to finish with all those offers. We have promised and we will first ensure all those offers are honoured before we go and hire somebody else. That’s the plan as we move forward,&quot; he added.  Tech Mahindra will continue to hire, train and deploy early career professionals and freshers in FY25, to control resource costs and manage margins as well.  HCLTech too is on track to continue hiring in FY25 and has been investing in people practices and setting up new programs to engage and train employees, said chief people officer Ramachandran Sundararajan.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/top-5-indian-it-services-companies-saw-a-decline-of-69167-employees-in-fy24-12709494.html

Rivals Infosys and Wipro, however, continued to shy away from divulging numbers despite a strong commentary on generative AI demand.  Investors were scanning for Gen AI-related announcements in the earnings fineprint of IT companies, even as the entire sector struggled with the ongoing slowdown in discretionary spend by IT services clients, macroeconomic headwinds and the burden of expectations set by Accenture's generative AI deal updates. But did the companies deliver?  Accenture  The company is in the middle of deploying $3 billion into building its AI capabilities. It also plans to upskill about 250,000 of its workforce in AI. Last month, Accenture said they are seeing robust interest for generative AI, with cumulative revenues of $1.1 billion during the first two quarters (Accenture follows September-August financial year).  TCS   On April 12, TCS shared that it has $900-million worth of generative AI and AI projects in the pipeline. At the TCS earnings call, CEO K Krithivasan had said, “Subsequent to our launch of AI.Cloud unit, we are seeing an increased traction in our marketplace. We have won more than 200 engagements in AI so far this year.”  “The number of engagements going into production is steadily increasing. Our AI and Gen AI pipeline has doubled in the quarter to $900 million,” he added.  Moreover, post earnings, in a letter to employees, Krithivasan highlighted that TCS has one of the largest AI-ready workforces. TCS has so far trained around 350,000 of its employees in AI skills.  Infosys  While Infosys did not share exact deal numbers or the pipeline size, CEO and MD Salil Parekh said that the company’s Gen AI practice is “industry leading.”  “The type of work we are doing, for instance, the 3 million lines of codes we have generated through large language models in generative AI is absolutely industry leading,” Parekh had said on April 18. Parekh added that nearly eight out of 10 of Infosys employees are now skilled in AI.  Infosys had last updated that it had 50 active generative AI client projects in the pipeline, back in June 2023.  Wipro  The company is in the middle of an overhaul under new CEO Srinivas Pallia, who said that industry-specific offerings and business solutions, mainly on consulting businesses, which can be infused with artificial intelligence (AI) will be one of the key strategies in a five-pointer business turnaround plan for the company.  Wipro will continue to build AI-ready talent at scale. This workforce will be trained to deliver industry-specific business solutions, Pallia said. So far, Wipro has trained about 225,000 employees in generative AI skilled.  In July 2023, Wipro had earmarked about $1 billion to invest into expanding its AI capabilities and business.  Gen AI changing hiring models, driving efficiency  One interesting narrative that emerged in Q4FY24 was companies, including Infosys and Wipro, talked about how generative AI and internal automation will be key levers in improving operating margins as well as chalking out hiring plan for FY25.  Wipro reported a second consecutive year of losing employees in FY24, after its headcount for the full year went down by 24,516. The hiring models too are fast changing, according to Wipro's HR chief Saurabh Govil.  Govil said that headcount reduction was mainly driven by demand environment as well as operational efficiencies, which have been reflected in the company's increased margins.  In the longer term, with AI taking centre-stage and as the company moves into more IP-based platforms AI, there could be a divergence coming, more and more in terms of headcount, Govil added.  &quot;But we still need to look at our entire portfolio, a large amount of work which we do with our clients, so it's a combination of both (demand and tech changes) as we move forward, and that it will evolve over a period of time,&quot; he said.  A similar commentary was found at Infosys’ analyst conference for Q4 earnings. While speaking of levers in place to achieve a 20-22 percent operating margin in FY25, CFO Jayesh Sanghrajka said, “On the GenAI and automation, we have done a lot of progress and we are doubling down on that. So I think all of those are baked in, in the current guidance of 20-22 percent. But our endeavor is, continues to improve operating margin in the mid-term.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/generative-ai-deals-accenture-tcs-infosys-wipro-12694221.html

Revenue declined 2.2% QoQ in cc terms, falling short of our expectations. Weakness was on account of persistent muted discretionary spending, along with a one-time impact of ~100bps due to re-scoping &amp;amp; re-negotiation with a large BFSI client. EBITM declined by 40bps QoQ to 20.1%, while adjusted for one-off impact from rescoping of a large BFSI contract, EBITM at ~21.1% fell slightly below our estimate of 21.4%. Large-deal TCV in Q4 was healthy at USD4.45bn, of which 44% is net new. Company has guided for revenue growth of 1-3% cc in FY25 (implying CQGR of 1.1-1.9%), with EBITM of 20-22%. Mgmt suggested that discretionary spending remains weak, as seen in H2FY24. Even after lowering revenue growth guidance through FY24, Infosys missed its implied Q4 guidance which raises concerns on growth predictability. Outlook We cut FY25-26E EPS by 6- 6.5%, building in the Q4 miss, lower guidance, and higher ETR. Continual performance miss is likely to weigh on the stock, but valuation is not demanding (~5% FCF yield). We retain BUY with TP now at Rs1,750, on 25x Mar-26E EPS.

The weak 4Q was partially driven by a 100bp one-off hit from re-scoping part of work the company does for a large BFSI client. As a result, FY24 revenue growth stood at 1.4%, missing the company’s guided growth band of 1.5%-2.0% YoY CC. The large deal TCV momentum remained intact at USD4.5b (up 2.1x YoY, net new at 44%).

Infosys reported a revenue of Rs 37,923 crore for the three months ended March, according to an exchange filing on April 18, falling short of analysts' projection of Rs 38,413 crore, based on an average of 13 brokerage estimates.  The net profit came in at Rs 7,969 crore, growing 30.5 percent over the previous quarter driven by income tax refunds, but overall missed analysts' estimates.  Experts said that the results were a “miss” despite strong deal wins. However, the revenue fell below expectations because of a one-time contract renegotiation of a large BFSI client at 1 percent of revenue. Infosys noted that 85 percent of the contract has been retained and the management is not seeing any further re-negotiation in the coming quarters.  As a result, the total revenue for FY24 grew at 1.4 percent, which missed the company’s guided growth band of 1.5-2.0 percent on-year in constant currency terms.

The IT player also announced acquisition of in-tech Holding GmbH, a German ER&amp;amp;D company, with revenue of $180 million. Nuvama Institutional Equities added that once the acquisition has been closed, which is likely in H1FY25, it could add 1 percent to the revenue, which has not been included in the guidance.  H1FY25 needs to be strong  International brokerage Nomura noted that to achieve its revenue guidance, Infosys needs to deliver growth of 0.6-1.4 percent CQGR in FY25. Based on seasonality, the second half of the year for IT companies tends to see zero-to-negative growth. Therefore, Q1 and Q2 need to show 3 percent sequential growth. “Overall, we bake in 2.9 percent on-year USD revenue growth in FY25 for Infosys,” said the brokerage.  Infosys has won large deals worth $17.7 billion, with 90 large deals in FY24, which is the highest ever large deal wins for Infosys.

Outlook  Despite the fourth quarterly earnings missing the estimates, brokerages maintained their ‘buy’ and ‘neutral’ calls on the stock. However, the target prices were slashed. To factor in the miss, Jefferies cut its estimations by 7-8 percent.    “Despite near-term weakness, we expect Infosys to be a key beneficiary of the acceleration in IT spending in the medium term,” said Motilal Oswal.  Nuvama Institutional Equities concurred, believing that Infosys’s growth shall pick up as discretionary spends revive in H2FY25. However, the brokerage said the stock may remain sideways until then and underperform peers such as TCS.  Citi added that if all things remain the same, investors should continue to accumulate Infosys shares on dips, at around Rs 1,350 levels. However, the brokerage has reduced the target multiple to 24x given the lower growth.

On the headcount front, Infosys’ headcount for the financial year 2024 declined by 25,994. This is also the first time in at least 23 years that the company's headcount has decreased.  The Bengaluru-based company has revised its annual revenue growth guidance five times in the previous five quarters, amid an uncertain demand environment.  In January, it narrowed its revenue growth guidance for the full year to 1.5-2 percent for the full year. The move came after it had previously slashed revenue guidance in September to 1-2.5 percent from 1-3.5 percent.  Before that, the company had reduced its revenue guidance for the fiscal to 1-3.5 percent from 4-7 percent, amid an increasingly challenging demand environment.  &quot;Good traction with cost efficiency and consolidation nature of large deals, we are yet to see visibility in digital and discretionary deals,&quot; said chief executive officer Salil Parekh.  Its revenue grew by 1.4 percent for the fiscal year 2024 and was flat for the fourth quarter year-on-year, in constant currency terms. The weak guidance stands in stark contrast to its deal wins, which increased by $4.5 billion in the fourth quarter. For FY24, Infosys won over $17 billion.  Parekh said that while the deal pipeline continues to be robust, discretionary spending is still not out of the woods.  The total headcount for the FY24 stood at 317,240, this is a 7.5 percent decrease from the previous year’s numbers.  On a quarterly basis, too, Infosys added 5,423 fewer employees, a drop for the fifth consecutive quarter.  &quot;Our hiring model has changed significantly in the last few quarters, last few years. We are now in a more agile kind of campus hiring. We do more than half the fresher hiring from off the campuses,&quot; said chief financial officer Jayesh Sanghrajka.

The Street expects the operating margin to expand moderately as cost optimisation continues under Project Maximus.  India’s second-largest information technology company is set to declare its January-March earnings on April 18.  Seasonal drag  Seasonal impact will weigh on revenue, which may decline 1.1 percent sequentially to Rs 38,413 crore, according to the median estimate of 13 brokerages polled by Moneycontrol. Profit after tax is expected to remain flat both sequentially and YoY at Rs 6,128 crore, according to the estimates, dragged by lower revenue but supported by margins.   Infosys Q4 result estimates  Moneycontrol’s consensus estimates indicate the company’s operating margin will expand by 20 basis points sequentially, but analysts are divided. Brokerages Nuvama and ICICI Securities expect its operating margin to fall, while Axis Securities, Nomura, Emkay Global and Jefferies expect it to expand.  Brokerages said operational efficiencies and lower onsite expenses will likely aid growth of margins, while being offset by wage hikes, higher visa costs, some furloughs, and revenue decline. Infosys rolled out wage hikes effective November 1, 2023, covering the entire employee pool.  Eyes on guidance  Most brokerages expect Infosys to maintain its revenue growth guidance in the range of 2-7 percent for the financial year, even as a recovery in discretionary spending by clients remains elusive.  Analysts at ICICI Securities are the most conservative, pegging the range at 1.5-2 percent, while brokerage Antique is the most optimistic, expecting growth guidance of 5-7 percent.  “Channel checks and peer commentaries do not indicate any immediate pick-up in short-term discretionary projects, with cost optimisation still imperative,” Axis Securities wrote in a pre-earnings research note.  Riding on continued cost optimisation, analysts expect Infosys to maintain its operating margin guidance for FY25 in the range of 20-22 percent.  Also Read | Q4 earnings preview: Mid-tier IT revenue growth may beat large firms, low US spends continue to hurt  Demand woes  Infosys’ larger rival Tata Consultancy Services declared its fourth-quarter results on April 12, and indicated that clients are still cautious on IT spending. Discretionary IT spending has not picked up and the focus on cost optimisation continues.  The fourth quarter is usually weak because of the seasonality factor, which results in muted sequential growth. In terms of sectors, manufacturing, energy and utility, and life sciences are doing well, whereas banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), luxury retail, hi-tech, and telecom continue to be under pressure.  “Deal pipeline is strong, and deals won in the previous quarter are ramping up as expected. We expect orderbook to be in line with average quarterly run-rate of $2.5-3.5 billion,” ICICI Securities said in a research note.  Brokerage JM Financial said it expects limited contribution from mega deals in the fourth quarter.  “Contribution of Infosys’ net new large deals (over $50 million) will likely be offset by run-down of smaller deals,” the brokerage said.  Also Read | TCS Q4 results: Net profit rises 9% to Rs 12,434 cr, firm declares final dividend of Rs 28 per share  Nuvama Institutional Equities is an outlier on this front, estimating steady deal wins and conservative commentary on the demand environment.  Nomura said its interactions with companies suggest demand has remained sluggish.  “Recent guidance cut from Accenture also points to tightening in client spending,” the brokerage said.  Share buyback  Various brokerages expect the Bengaluru-based company to announce a share buyback on April 18. The software exporter last bought back shares worth Rs 9,300 crore in February 2023.  “We expect Infosys to announce a buyback of Rs 100-110 billion, in line with capital allocation policy,” said Axis Securities.  The Street will also await management commentary on customer sentiment and discretionary spending as well as expected ramp-up schedule of deals won in FY24.

infosys,2024-04-16T08:01:10+05:30,Reshab Shaw,Infosys Q4FY24 earnings preview: Top five factors at play,"Infosys is expected to post revenue of Rs 38,413 crore in Q4, implying a 2.6% YoY increase but a sequential decline of 1.1%. Net profit is estimated to be flat both sequentially and YoY at Rs 6,128 crore.","Information technology firm Infosys is expected to post tepid numbers for the fourth quarter ending March 31, 2024, as discretionary spending remains elusive. India’s second-largest IT services company will declare its results on April 18.  Highlighting headwinds and tailwinds impacting the company's performance, analysts remain cautious yet optimistic for Infosys in Q4.  Factors such as recovery from furloughs, operational efficiencies, and the absence of one-time costs related to the McCamish cyber incident are seen as tailwinds to margin. On the other hand, challenges such as visa costs and wage hikes are potential headwinds.  As Infosys gears up to release its fourth-quarter earnings, here is a list of five themes that will be closely watched.  Revenue Growth  Analysts anticipate Infosys to post flattish revenue for the fourth quarter. Tepid discretionary spending and the impact of wage hikes are expected to drag down revenues. The Bengaluru-headquartered firm had rolled out wage hikes effective November 1, 2023, to all its employees.  According to Moneycontrol’s estimates, Infosys is expected to post revenue of Rs 38,413 crore for the quarter, implying a 2.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase but a sequential decline of 1.1 percent.  Net profit is estimated to be flat both sequentially and YoY at Rs 6,128 crore.    Dollar revenue is expected to decline in Q4 even after factoring in a cross-currency tailwind in the range of 20 basis points (bps), brokerages said. However, the absence of a one-time cost from the McCamish cyber incident and operational efficiencies could partially offset challenges.  In November 2023, Infosys’ step-down subsidiary McCamish was hit by a ransomware attack, resulting in the unavailability of certain applications and systems.  Brokerage ICICI Securities expects the company to clock in revenue worth $4.6 million in January-March from the recently acquired inSemi business.  Street would expect clarity on how the company performed in Q4 to understand the wider prevailing demand environment.  Revenue and Margin Guidance  Revenue and margin guidance for the fiscal year 2024-25 (FY25) will be closely monitored.  Brokerages anticipate Infosys’ revenue guidance for the fiscal year to be in the range of 2-7 percent. Among them, analysts at ICICI Securities take the most conservative stance, projecting the range to be between 1.5-2 percent.  On the other hand, Antique Stock Broking is the most bullish, expecting the range to be 5-7 percent.  Infosys has revised its annual revenue growth guidance four times in the previous four quarters. In January, it narrowed its revenue growth guidance for the full year to 1.5-2 percent for the full year. The move came after it had earlier slashed revenue guidance in September to 1-2.5 percent from 1-3.5 percent.  Before that, the company had reduced its revenue guidance for the fiscal to 1-3.5% from 4-7%, amid an increasingly challenging demand environment. Therefore, analysts would look for a more stable number to work with.  On the margins front, analysts anticipate that Infosys will maintain its operating margin guidance for the fiscal year 2024-25 in the range of 20-22 percent.  In Q3, operating margin was down 70 bps to 20.5 percent, which was affected by furloughs and salary hikes.  Demand check  The fourth quarter for IT companies is typically a weak one, due to seasonal factors, resulting in subdued sequential growth. Q4 is somewhat seasonally weak for the IT sector because of fewer working days and additional furloughs in January.  Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys' major competitor, recently released its results and highlighted that clients remain cautious about IT spending. Discretionary IT expenditures are yet to show signs of recovery, with companies maintaining their focus on cost optimisation deals.  Nomura said its recent interactions with companies suggest demand is still sluggish. “Recent guidance cut from Accenture also points to tightening in client spending,” the brokerage added.  “Deal pipeline is strong and deals won in the previous quarter are ramping up as expected. We expect orderbook to be in line with an average quarterly run-rate of $2.5-3.5 billion,” said ICICI Securities in a research note.  Brokerage JM Financial said it expects limited contribution from mega deals in Q4.  Employee metrics  Infosys’ headcount shrunk by 6,101 for the quarter ending December 31, making it the fourth consecutive quarter in which the company ended with fewer employees.  Analysts opine that furloughs will have a marginal bearing in Q4FY24, impacting margins.  Over the quarters, attrition has been declining consistently, indicative of a cooling talent market as attrition rates further normalises. For October-December, the company’s attrition declined 170 bps to 12.9 percent from the previous quarter's 14.6 percent.  Commentary by the management on headcount, furloughs, and attrition will be closely monitored.  In January, the company had said it sees no immediate campus requirement and would recruit as and when demand arises. Street would want an update on that front as well.  Gen AI  Infosys might declare its revenue from generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) deals after larger rivals Accenture and TCS declared theirs, experts say.  It is worth noting that TCS is the first Indian IT company to declare revenue from Gen AI deals. At $900 million, the company doubled its revenue from the nascent technology in the quarter.  In June 2023, Infosys said it had 50 active client projects in the dock for leveraging Gen AI capabilities. The Street would expect commentary on this metric and its market share.  Revenue generation through Gen AI deals has become more important at a time when most clients are cutting back on spending amid challenging times.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/infosys-q4fy24-earnings-preview-top-five-factors-at-play-12646511.html

Ahead of the elections, markets are poised to see some volatility, despite most traders believing that the poll results are being priced in, leading the D-Street bulls to seek safety and in quality large-caps.  The market is closely awaiting the earning results from the March quarter, with early predictions that the upcoming report card will please all investors and traders alike, but that remains to be seen.  Gland Pharma (Rs 1,807, -2.83%)  Around 5.5 percent equity of Gland Pharma has changed hands in a block deal on April 9.  Bull argument: The company has introduced a total of 13 products into the US market, including nine entirely new products in Q3FY24. Gland Pharma    has enhanced its geographical footprint in Europe through the acquisition of Cenexi for CDMO operations.  Bear argument: Any delay in launching biosimilars in the market could also pose challenges to the company's operations and growth strategy, says Axis Securities.  Container Corporation (Rs 924.3, +1.42%)  The stock gained after MOSL reiterated a 'buy' call on potential benefits from the dedicated freight corridor.  Bull argument: “CCRI will be a key beneficiary of the dedicated freight corridor (DFC), which is likely to result in volume growth driven by a modal shift and enhanced operating efficiencies,” the brokerage said in a note. It further expects the company to benefit from the shift in northern hinterland volumes from Gujarat ports to JNPT after the entire DFC commissioning, which is likely to be completed in FY26.  Bear argument: The company had reported weak Q3FY24 earnings as global trade disruptions hurt EXIM volumes. “Commissioning of the Western DFC by Dec-24 (JNPT section) should be a trigger for volume growth starting FY26E, but this container ecosystem expansion is adequately baked in for now,” Nuvama had said in a January report.  Infosys (Rs 1,497.25, +1.39)  BofA upgraded the stock to 'buy' from 'neutral' and raised the target price of to Rs 1,785 from Rs 1,735, citing attractive valuations, implying over 18 percent upside from current levels.  Bull argument: BofA analysts anticipates a demand recovery for the company in FY25. IT spends is expected to see uptick after the US elections.  Bear argument: The stock has shed 3 percent YTD, underperforming the bench mark Nifty’s 4 percent gain.

infosys,2024-04-05T13:41:28+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,Technology services firms to see over $20 billion in deal renewals in FY25,"Of this, nearly 51-53 percent will be driven by the top five Indian IT firms — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra, according to data from UnearthInsight.","Global technology services and ER&amp;amp;D (engineering, research &amp;amp; development) companies are gearing up for deal renewals worth over $20 billion lined up for the financial year 2025, though renewal timelines will take longer than usual due to overall slowdown, regional and  SMB banking challenges, and inflationary pressures.  Of this, nearly 51-53 percent will be driven by the top five Indian IT firms — Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra, according to data from market intelligence firm UnearthInsight, exclusively accessed by Moneycontrol.  This is coming at a time when Accenture’s recent tepid performance has left analysts worried about the fate of Indian IT companies  in FY25.  Indian technology services companies seem to have an edge over global peers in retaining 90 percent of these renewal deals,  according to the data. This will be mainly driven by  Indian tier-I and tier-II companies winning 60-70 percent  of the vendor consolidation deals. Indian companies are also the preferred choice of customers for cost optimisation, enhanced capability deals for embedding technologies like AI, generative AI, cloud modernisation, infra, and maintenance.  Cost optimisation here refers to customers looking to control costs of running a business by deploying technology.  In terms of sectors, unlike new deals, renewals would be broad based and spread across customers from telecom, government departments,  public sector, energy, hi-tech, and aerospace, among others.  Meanwhile, globally, around 55-65 percent of new deals  are currently coming largely from four key segments, including BFSI, hi-tech, the public sector, and energy, oil &amp;amp; gas.  Changing terms of deal negotiations  Amid the productivity gain expectations from generative AI, customers tightening tech budgets, continued macroeconomic uncertainties, and technology companies looking to streamline operations with layoffs, the terms of renewed deals too might differ, experts said.  According to Peter Bendor-Samuel, Founder of management consulting firm Everest Group, there is a fair amount of hesitation in the market, with all deals continuing to slip. “We anticipate that this is likely to continue for several more months,” he told Moneycontrol.  Gaurav Vasu, Founder and CEO of UnearthInsight, highlighted that deal renewal negotiations, which usually take around six to eight weeks to close, are being pushed  by about four weeks.  “While that may not sound very big,  a month’s delay pushes the entire revenue cycle by a quarter, and impacts your planning of backfills and managing net new revenue. There are several aspects to it,” he said.  Vasu added that negotiations will be tougher, with a demand for better discounting. “Focus will be on consolidation of vendors, even consolidation from large to mid- and small-size companies that are able to offer better discounts. While there will be price increases on renewal, customers will be asking for more discounts to continue,” he said.  Bendor-Samuel concurred, saying there is intense pricing pressure which could well lead to even vendor switching. Adding to this pressure is an expectation mismatch.  “The enterprises believe that Gen AI should deliver upwards of 40 percent productivity gains, while vendors / service providers are currently offering 8-12 percent based on what they can deliver. This gap in expectations could lead to vendor switching,” he said.  IT companies are currently at various stages of proofs-of-concept (PoCs)  of generative AI with customers. While customers are curious to integrate the technology quickly into their businesses, many are yet to figure out impactful use cases.  As of now the share of business coming from generative AI, especially for some of India’s largest software service providers, is still very low compared to global peers like Accenture.  In February, Moneycontrol had reported that the top 10 Indian IT service companies together have around 450 Gen AI projects and PoCs in the pipeline, which would amount to an estimated deal pipeline of $150-250 million. Whereas global rival Accenture alone, as of its first quarter (it follows a September-August financial year), has a pipeline worth $450 million and an estimated 450 projects and PoCs.  As of the December-February quarter, Accenture added another $600 million in generative AI deals.  FY25 themes to watch out for  Indian IT companies are set to report their fourth quarter earnings for the fiscal year 2024 from next week, which means investors would be plugged in to get an outlook on the demand and challenges expected in the upcoming fiscal year.  For technology services and ER&amp;amp;D companies, net deal wins include 55-65 percent of new deals, and 35-45 percent in renewed deals. UnearthInsight expects tier II and boutique firms to continue to outgrow  tier-I peers, especially when it comes to  net new deals in FY25.  According to the data, in FY25, some of the big themes to watch out for include significant cost pressures, customers demanding productivity improvements from generative AI investments, and how Global Captive Centres, or GCCs, compete with Indian and global tech firms.  “Clients from BFSI and hi-tech (FAANG) sectors are pushing vendors for significant cost optimisation and adopting agile talent strategies (GCC + headquarter partnership, location, talent pyramid, upskilled talent, etc.) to pass on the benefits to clients,” Vasu said.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/technology-services-firms-to-see-over-20-billion-in-deal-renewals-in-fy25-12581451.html

It has upgraded Persistent Systems, LTIMindtree and KPIT Technologies and has taken an 'overweight' stance on Infosys and L&amp;amp;T Technology.  Shares of Persistent Systems were upgraded to 'overweight' from the earlier 'neutral' call, while its price target was raised to Rs 4,400 apiece. Both LTIMindtree and KPIT Tech received an upgrade to 'neutral' from the previous 'underweight' call with a target price of Rs 5,200 and Rs 1,400. JPMorgan also initiated coverage on Coforge with an 'overweight' tag, assigning the stock a price target of Rs 7,000.  As for the demand environment, JPMorgan believes that it has remained stagnant since reaching a bottom in the second half of CY23, with no noticeable improvement expected in either Q4FY24 or Q1FY25.  Likewise, the firm feels that this subdued demand is likely to lead to poor Q4 exit rates and could dampen the FY25 guidance across IT companies. According to the firm, the negative price action seen in Nifty IT index (down 1.3 percent year-to-date) suggests that these expectations are factored in.  Follow our live blog for all the market action  &quot;Despite this, the market should overlook a soft Q4, as Infosys' FY25 revenue guidance of 2-4 percent and HCLTech's guidance of 4-6 percent might surprise investors positively,&quot; the firm added.  Going ahead, JPMorgan also anticipates an outperformance of midcaps over other large-scale IT firms, while ERPs (Enterprise Resource Planning solutions) likely to surpass traditional IT companies. &quot;In a tactical move, portfolios focusing on non-discretionary sectors could outshine those with discretionary holdings,&quot; it said.

TCS has called applications from BTech, BE, MCA, MSc and MS batch of 2024. The last day to apply is April 10 and tests will be held on April 26, according to the career page of the company's website.

As the company hasn’t specified the numbers, it remains to be seen how many offer letters will be handed out by India’s top recruiter in the IT sector.  The management said in January that the process to recruit freshers for the financial year 2024-25 had begun but it is now that the company is visiting campuses.  “We have commenced our campus hiring process for the next year and see tremendous excitement among freshers to join TCS,” Milind Lakkad, Chief HR Officer, TCS said during a December earnings call.

infosys,2024-03-01T13:16:09+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,"Chip Wars: How Infy, HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra are walking the semiconductor talk","Top Indian and global IT services companies, like Accenture, Infosys, HCLTech, Capgemini, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra, have acquired many semiconductor design and R&amp;D companies, and are making huge investments in the sector.","Indian and global IT services giants are betting big on semiconductor engineering, research and development (ER&amp;amp;D) services as the next crucial segment, amidst chipmakers making massive investments to expand manufacturing plants following the global chip shortage.  What is interesting is that this moment has been in the making for the past few years, with top Indian and global IT services companies, like Accenture, Infosys, HCLTech, Capgemini, Wipro and Tech Mahindra, acquiring semiconductor firms to offer third-party R&amp;amp;D services and take advantage of the burgeoning sector.  Semiconductors or semiconductor chips are the various memory chips and microprocessors used in electronic devices.  Last week, both HCLTech and Wipro announced partnerships with Intel Foundry. HCLTech is collaborating with Intel Foundry to co-develop customised silicon solutions for semiconductor manufacturers, system OEMs and cloud services providers to enhance foundry services, while Wipro will be its key design services and alliance partner to develop Intel’s most advanced process nodes.  The acquisition route  In January, Infosys announced the acquisition of InSemi, a leading semiconductor design and embedded services provider, to strengthen its portfolio of semiconductor-focused ER&amp;amp;D capabilities.  Among Infosys’s Indian peers, HCLTech acquired Sankalp Semiconductor in 2019, Tech Mahindra acquired Cerium Systems in 2020 and Wipro acquired Eximus Design in 2020.  “IT services companies have been working with semiconductor companies and speaking about it for some time now. But given the current scale and the limelight around semiconductors, you get to hear more public announcements of deals and partnerships. IT companies want to be a part of this growing activity in the semiconductor sector,” an equity analyst, who didn’t want to be named, told Moneycontrol.  IT companies’ acquisitions are now bearing fruits as following the global chip shortage of 2020-2023, chip makers around the world have announced new investments worth billions of dollars to expand semiconductor fabrication and manufacturing plants. To be sure, policymakers and governments too are coming up with initiatives to attract these investments and strengthen the industry in their countries.  A case in point is India’s Rs 76,000-crore production linked incentive (PLI) scheme for semiconductor manufacturing. In fact, on February 29, the Union Cabinet approved three semiconductor plant proposals for an estimated cost of Rs 1.26 lakh crore.  These proposals included India’s first semiconductor fabrication plant or fab by Tata Electronics and Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.    Chip-to-cloud strategy  According to Dinesh Rao, Executive Vice President, Co-Head of Delivery, Infosys, the IT company’s collaboration with InSemi will accelerate Infosys’ “Chip-to-Cloud strategy” by bringing niche design skills at scale and will also pair seamlessly with existing investments in engineering services, AI/automation platforms, and industry partnerships.  “The semiconductor industry is poised for a significant growth with advances in areas like 5G, AI/ML, IoT, high-performance computing and autonomous technologies. The IT services industry is well positioned to take advantage of the growth in this segment,” Rao told Moneycontrol.  In March last year, HCLTech even said that it plans to double its semiconductor business over the next 3-4 years. HCLTech’s parent HCL Group is currently in the process of setting up electronic chip plants under the PLI Scheme. HCLTech will be assisting with end-to-end processing of chips.  Vijay Anand Guntur, President, Engineering and R&amp;amp;D Services, HCLTech calls this trend of acquisition of semiconductor R&amp;amp;D firms by the IT industry a strategic response to the growing demand for advanced technologies.  &quot;The global semiconductor industry is projected to become a trillion-dollar industry by 2030. This market sizing is exciting for HCLTech as it aligns with our investments. Furthermore, the demand to design and produce specialized AI chips that can empower technologies like ML, large language models, VR, cloud and analytics is on the rise,&quot; he told Moneycontrol.  Guntur added that the demand is coming from customer companies trying to create custom silicon to get a competitive edge over peers. HCLTech is helping them develop custom silicon designs at substantial cost savings and accelerated development timelines, he said.  For Tech Mahindra, the hi-tech segment has been one of its highest growing segments in the last two years, and the company believes that semiconductor is going to be a crucial part of this story, going forward.  “You cannot ignore the opportunity that the semiconductor business brings. Semiconductor businesses have a very strong capability of engineering, design and what you see as foundries,” Jagdish Mitra, head, India business and corporate affairs, Tech Mahindra, told Moneycontrol.  He added that technologies are becoming more and more integrated with the demand for the digital segment, especially as the AI world starts to become more device-centric. This will make semiconductor and chips a critical part of Tech Mahindra’s capability to address that segment.  The company, like its peers, chose the acquisition route since this is not a home-grown technology and the speed of response was important, Mitra said.  Queries sent to Wipro didn’t elicit any response till the time of publishing this report.  Core IT services business slowing down  While core IT services business have started to slow down with revenue growth halving to 3.8 percent in FY24, as compared to 8.4 percent in FY23, ER&amp;amp;D services continue to remain a growth hotspot that companies want to bank on, according to tech industry body Nasscom’s Strategic Review 2024.  Moneycontrol had previously reported that ER&amp;amp;D services is poised to see at least 10-12 percent growth in India over the next five years.  “Engineering service providers want to play in the whole stack from chip to products to software, all the way up to cloud. Not being present in this whole stack means giving an opening to competition,” Pareekh Jain, founder of consulting firm EIIRTrend, said in his blogpost explaining the trend.  India’s next big opportunity  Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) managing director Rajiv Gupta calls this a post-COVID phenomenon, driven by growing demand for ER&amp;amp;D services from segments like autonomous driving, R&amp;amp;D in healthcare, software engineering, platform engineering and financial services, to name a few.  Coupled with India’s geopolitical push and policymaking in semiconductor manufacturing, this becomes two intersecting areas in a Venn diagram, Gupta said.  “The push towards semiconductor is massive. There's a clear mandate to make India the next big semiconductor manufacturing hub. One of the biggest things in semiconductor manufacturing, especially chips, is the design and the engineering services,” Gupta told Moneycontrol.  While a lot of this capacity for semiconductor manufacturing built here is meant for global consumption, India too is expected to drive significant demand as a consumer of semiconductor products.  In terms of India’s semiconductor consumption, it is expected to reach $64 billion by 2026, tripling in size from $22 billion in 2019, with a projected 16 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over that period. This is estimated to nearly double to reach $110 billion by 2030, at which point analysts anticipate India will account for an approximately 10 percent share of direct global semiconductor consumption, according to an India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA) and Counterpoint Research report.  'Talent pool will be better utilised'  BCG’s Gupta also highlighted that the growth in ER&amp;amp;D services would mean India’s huge existing engineering talent pool will be better utilised. Most engineers in the country have been largely used for software coding, but this trend brings an opportunity to engineers specialising in other areas like mechanical, automobile, electrical, civil as well.  According to a recent report commissioned by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and the IESA, by venturing into semiconductor manufacturing, India will only build upon its decade-long experience in semiconductor design, where it accounts for 20 percent of the world’s integrated circuit (IC) design workforce, over 125,000 workers.  Forrester Research India’s head of research Ashutosh Sharma said that even as fabrication grows in the country, the real innovation and talent deployment will continue to be in chip designing.  “The number of chips that organisations will need for all sorts of things for IoT, AI etc., is growing. That demand will require not just the fab part of it which is expensive, but once you bought machines from ASML (a Dutch multinational corporation), and bought other things that go into their making in the  manufacturing process, the upfront design is where most of the brainy stuff happens,” he told Moneycontrol.  “That's where the innovation is going to be in terms of advanced nodes of 7 nanometer, 9nm to 3-4 nm…and that’s where demand will be from end customers,” he said.  Demand for workforce  The Semicon India Future Skills Talent Committee's report said that the semiconductor sector will need a workforce of 1.5 million by 2032, for activities such as chip design and fabrication.  According to specialist staffing firm Xpheno, the sector, at present, is hiring professionals in the design, manufacturing and R&amp;amp;D roles. It extends opportunities to engineers across diverse domains, including electrical engineering, hardware and software development, and telecom engineering.  From an IT services perspective, however, Prasadh MS, Head of Workforce Research at Xpheno, told Moneycontrol that semiconductor-related R&amp;amp;D and engineering work at IT companies have become tech-driven, using platforms and tools that were available to the automotive sector earlier.  Further, IT companies have made these acquisitions or have gone through the acquisition route to find readily trained semiconductor talent, to begin with.  “IT companies are using both the inorganic and the organic route to build semiconductor capabilities. The inorganic way of acquisitions will give them the early-mover advantage while they will start building an ecosystem of in-house talent around it. They will ramp up and train as per project requirements,” he said.

This also comes weeks after it faced flak for not creating enough jobs in Hubballi, Karnataka.  In an internal communication accessed by Moneycontrol, Infosys said, &quot;Since commencing operations on August 1, 2022, our Hubballi Development Center offers a world-class experience with all the amenities you need to thrive!&quot;  The message encourages employees to take advantage of 'undisturbed work settings, constructive collaborations, and team connections', along with on-campus benefits such as food courts and lush green surroundings.  The communication is intended to gauge employees' interest in working at the Hubballi DC.  Employees have been invited to respond to a survey, and the company has assured a seamless transition to the Hubballi DC for interested individuals.  Further, Infosys stressed the convenience of having a campus close to home, especially for those from Hubballi, Vizag, Kolkata, Coimbatore, and Noida. The communication also highlights the hybrid workstyle, bringing the best of both worlds - the 'vibrancy of Infosys campus life' and the flexibility of working from home.  It may be recalled that Infosys faced criticism in the Karnataka assembly on February 13 for not creating jobs at its Hubballi campus. Arvind Bellad, deputy leader of the opposition and BJP leader, urged the government to revoke the allocated 58 acres of land to Infosys in Hubballi due to their failure in job creation.  Industry Minister MB Patil, said he will soon visit the campus, which currently employs 280 employees and 122 contract workers, utilising only 20 acres of the allocated 58 acres.  He stated that the government could reclaim the land if Infosys fails to implement the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the state government, which aimed to provide at least 1,000 jobs to local candidates.  During a discussion on local employment opportunities, Bellad, MLA from Hubballi-Dharwad (West), expressed dissatisfaction, alleging that Infosys took 58 acres in an industrial estate but has not created a single job, engaging only in gardening and landscaping.  Bellad pointed out that Infosys received the land at a discounted rate of Rs 35 lakh per acre, compared to its actual value of Rs 1.5 crore. He also highlighted his efforts to convince farmers to part with their lands with the assurance of job opportunities for their children and urged for penalties on the firm for not delivering on its commitments.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/food-courts-lush-green-campus-undisturbed-work-infosys-woos-employees-to-return-to-office-12378461.html

She later credited her unconventional upbringing for instilling in her the confidence and courage to stand up to the gold snatcher.","Sudha Murty had quite an exceptional upbringing. When she was eight years old, she was allowed to take buses all by herself. Her parents had given her the freedom to read all that she could and was also permitted to step out of the house as freely as her brother Shrinivas.  It's this upbringing that gave her the courage, confidence, and a strong will, all of which came into use when the former chairperson of Infosys Foundation came across a gold snatcher.  One morning, when Sudha Murty was walking to school by herself, a man tried to snatch her gold earrings. Instead of being scared, she yelled at him and began to smack him with the umbrella she was carrying. As a young student, Murty even berated the man for his wrongdoing. Shocked, the thief fled.  The incident came to light after the release of the biography ‘An Uncommon Love: The Early Life of Sudha and Narayana Murthy’ by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, published by Juggernaut Books.  Sharing other details of Murty's unconventional upbringing at the time, the book revealed that her father RH Kulkarni discussed menstruation -- which was considered an 'unclean' activity by most unconservative families -- with her and her sisters when they hit puberty. He also pointed out that it was a biological condition and there was nothing to be ashamed of.  Emboldened by her family's support, Sudha Murty even decided to cut her hair short and wear pants -- something that would have caused a commotion in most traditional families at the time -- and no one stopped her.

Infosys Co-Founder NR Narayana Murthy and his philanthropist wife and former Chairperson of Infosys Foundation, Sudha Murthy, were speaking at the launch of Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's book, &quot;An Uncommon Love: The Early Life of Sudha and Narayana Murthy.&quot;  The Murthy family was in full attendance on February 10, with son Rohan Murthy and daughter (and UK's first lady) Akshata Murthy accompanying their parents, along with their granddaughters Anoushka and Krishna.  The crowd gathered in Bengaluru's St Joseph's College of Commerce to hear Narayana and Sudha Murthy was charmed by the story of how the couple met for the first time.  The book  In the early 1970s, one of her friends told Mrs Murthy, an avid reader, that  his roommate owned an extensive collection of books. Intrigued, she decided to head towards their residence in Pune.  “When I knocked on the door, a college student opened it: petite, bespectacled, very serious, and very young. I wondered who he was?” Sudha told the audience. In reality, Narayana Murthy is four years elder to Sudha. “I thought he’s so small in structure and reading so much,” she said as the audience burst into laughter.

While Infosys was the most upgraded IT stock in January, LTIMindtree was the most downgraded","Information technology giant Infosys was the most upgraded stock in one month (ended January 31, 2024), according to Moneycontrol's analyst tracker, while LTIMindtree featured as the most downgraded.  This comes after both companies reported their earnings for the quarter ended December 2023. Both the companies' Q3 results came in below Moneycontrol's poll estimates.  However, Infosys saw upgrades as analysts expect its growth to accelerate in FY25 on account of the ramp-up of large deals, strong deal pipeline, and expected recovery in discretionary spending.  Meanwhile, LTIMindtree was downgraded as brokerages expect near-term weakness for the IT major. Its margins are likely to be impacted in the near term due to re-investment in business and transition costs of large deals.  According to the Moneycontrol analyst tracker, the 'buy' calls on Infosys went up from 23 to 30 over one month and the 'hold' call fell from 14 to seven. The 'sell' call on the counter remained unchanged at eight.  In contrast, LTIMindtree saw its 'buy' calls go down from 20 to 12 over a month and 'sell' calls jump from 11 to 17 during this period. The ‘hold' rating on the counter increased by one to 12.  Valuations getting expensive, markets may correct in near term: Tata MF's Rahul Singh  Why analysts are positive on Infosys  Infosys' Q3 earnings were the first set of decent results after back-to-back disappointments. Its deal wins in the quarter, while modest, had a high share of net new deals (71 percent), which should boost growth for FY25 and beyond, according to Nuvama Institutional Equities.  Analysts at the brokerage believe that Q3 could be the bottom for the earnings downgrade cycle for Infosys, and it expects strong deal wins of the last few quarters to convert into revenue even as the US macro environment becomes favourable.  Infosys management’s margin improvement program, project Maximus, is creating impact and gaining traction. Thus bringing confidence in the medium term for improvement in margins.  Margin levers going forward include improving utilisation levels, pyramid optimisation, increasing offshore effort mix, GenAI automation and better pricing, according to analysts.  Despite the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, Infosys has managed to execute better than expected, which should help the company in its growth beyond FY24E, said KR Choksey in its report.  The IT giant's margin improvement plan and focus on GenAI, cloud and other services seem promising and could help generate superior returns, according to the brokerage.  Analysts at Sharekhan also believe that the large deal signings and continuity of renewals will gain further traction as macro headwinds recede, improving earning visibility for FY25/FY26E.  Geojit Financial Services said that healthy deal wins and acquisitions would continue to support Infosys' earnings performance in the medium to long term. Additionally, sustained cost minimisation efforts will continue to limit any downfall in margins  Why analysts downgraded LTIMindtree  LTIMindtree's Q3 earnings missed the Street's estimates on all major fronts. In addition, a weak management commentary triggered a cautious outlook from brokerages that anticipate more pain for the company, going ahead.  International brokerage Nomura sees no signs of a significant demand revival yet for LTIMindtree.  The IT major delayed its ambition to achieve a 17-18 percent operating margin by a few quarters on account of hiring. This did not sit well with several brokerages. HSBC feels LTIMindtree's worsened Q4 outlook and a pullback on its margin ambitions suggest medium-term portfolio headwinds.  Analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities also feel that LTIMindtree's management commentary did not exude much confidence as the company grapples with delayed decision-making and weak macros.  Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that the near-term slowdown in discretionary spending and its meaningful exposure to BFS (banking and financial services) would have an adverse impact on LTIMindtree's growth performance.  Additionally, the decision to delay the 17-18 percent aspirational band by three to four quarters indicates limited room for further cost optimisation and the front-ended impact of a large deal scaling up in the near term, the brokerage said.  Also Read: LIC becomes India's 5th most valued firm, gains 4% on strong Q3 results  According to Elara Capital, some headwinds from furloughs, higher pass-throughs and moderation in utilisation may persist, going forward. This may limit margin rebound in Q4FY24. The next quarter's outlook suggests a gradual recovery from furloughs and continued pass-through revenues.  Analysts are cautious about overall demand due to delayed decision-making and with many clients yet to finalise their budgets. Also, discretionary projects have not ramped up as expected, indicating a lag in decision-making, particularly in the company’s discretionary portfolio.

That’s why the IT services companies in India are going fast and furious on it, the Microsoft CEO has said ","Microsoft chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said on February 7 Indian IT services player like Infosys, HCLTech and LTIMindtree are not just driving artificial intelligence (AI) and Copilot adoption but also customising the technology for internal use.  Copilot is Microsoft's AI-powered digital assistant, similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT.  Even GPU-maker NVIDIA has deployed Copilot for everyone within the organisation, Nadella said while addressing prominent Indian CEOs at the Microsoft CEO Connection event in Mumbai.  “Firm-level differences will start to show up especially in tech in the short order if you are not an early adopter (of AI). That’s why we are seeing the IT services companies in India going fast and furious on it,” Nadella said.  Nadella is on a two-day visit to India, an annual ritual, with theme for 2024 set as AI and opportunities arising out of it. He is expected in Bengaluru on February 8.  Nadella shared that HCLTech and LTIMindtree are not only adopting Copilot also adding their own workflows to it.  “So, it's not just the horizontal tools that are baked in but in the case of HCLTech, a lot of their project management in bug triage is integrated into the Copilot. In the case of LTIMindtree, even the insights into how they drive their staffing for various projects is plugged into it (Copilot),” he said.  Infosys was a big example of using GitHub Copilot. It was the most proven use case of productivity going robust, he said.  “In some sense, it's not just the one workflow that we have, you can steer it into the workflows that matter inside your enterprise. So the Copilot understanding is not just what was pre-fabricated, it is what your enterprise is, and that's exciting,” he said.  AI driving rural economy  Nadella said Indian non-profit startup Karya.ai was bringing well-paying jobs to rural India using Copilot.  Karya, started in 2021 by Manu Chopra, works with 30,000 rural Indians for completing 40 million paid digital jobs involving capturing, labelling and annotating data for AI training across speech, text, images and videos in 12 Indian languages.  Nadella said the foundation of the startup came from Microsoft research in India. Copilot aided the non-profit to become a thriving organisation, bringing jobs to rural India, creating economic opportunity.  “This is pretty unique and it's fantastic to see. And it’s not just people who are software developers participating… India also has a lot more AI engineers and the AI engineering community here is second only to the United States,” he said.  According to Nadella, the AI revolution is the first time that India was on par with the rest of the world, bridging the gaps, given its fast paced growth in AI adoption.  “If anything, the use cases here are so unique and paving their own path.

A ‘Sunday Mirror’ report based on a freedom of information (FOI) request said Trade Minister Lord Dominic Johnson discussed the UK operations of Infosys during a meeting at the company’s offices in Bengaluru during a visit last April.  A readout of the meeting reportedly said Lord Johnson “made clear that he was keen to see a bigger Infosys presence in the UK and would be happy to do what he could to facilitate that”. “After the Tories handed billions in taxpayers’ cash to cronies for duff PPE (personal protective equipment), the public will wonder why an outfit so personally close to Rishi Sunak appears to have been granted this VIP access. There are serious questions to answer,” Labour’s shadow minister Jonathan Ashworth told the newspaper.  Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, has a 0.91 per cent stake valued at around GBP 500 million in the IT business co-founded by her father and received millions in dividends in the past financial year.  A “steering brief” for the meeting is reported to have said that it “would be good to reassure them on the prospects for the UK economy and remind them of the support that we can provide through DBT [Department for Business and Trade]”. Lord Johnson is said to have outlined to the Infosys executives, whose names were redacted in the FOI documents, the advantages for the multinational as a result of the UK’s high-potential individual visa scheme.  “The investment minister regularly meets businesses and international investors, including a range of Indian businesses, to champion the UK as an investment destination and secure commitments worth billions of pounds. That engagement drives investment across the UK, creating thousands of high-quality jobs and boosting the UK economy,” said a DBT spokesperson.  Infosys has been approached for a reaction over these latest claims, coming in the wake of some Opposition murmurings around Infosys seeking visa benefits to accrue from the proposed India-UK free trade agreement (FTA).  The briefing paper for the April 2023 meeting reportedly notes that one of the objectives was to “reassure that the FTA will further create new opportunities and investor-friendly policies to support business growth”. This is the latest Opposition attack faced by Sunak’s wife over her business interests after Labour raised questions over Akshata Murty’s decision to liquidate an investment venture named Catamaran Ventures.  The 43-year-old Indian businesswoman and daughter of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy had incorporated the venture in 2013 with her husband as one of the directors before he resigned in 2015. It had emerged in a financial statement last year that she had decided to wind down her firm as a going concern.  The personal finances of Sunak and his wife have previously also been under scrutiny when it was revealed that Murty had legal non-domicile tax status, which meant she did not have to pay UK tax on her Indian income. However, after an Opposition furore over this issue, she relinquished her non-dom tax status and said she would pay all her taxes in the UK to prevent the issue from becoming a distraction for her husband’s political career.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/uk-opposition-attacks-vip-access-for-infosys-due-to-sunak-family-link-12197411.html
infosys,2024-02-05T14:11:32+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,Accenture’s $450-million Gen AI pipeline is more than the top 10 Indian IT companies’ combined,"The global giant also has the advantage of being a one-stop shop of a kind. However, analysts hasten to add that not all these projects are money-spinners.","Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be the buzzword but it is still insignificant in terms of business volumes for some of India's largest software service providers. Going by the numbers and narrative on generative AI for the third quarter ended December 31, these companies’ Gen AI deal pipelines were stagnant in terms of the number of ongoing proofs of concept (PoCs) and opportunities compared to the previous quarters.  At present, the top 10 Indian IT service companies together have around 450 Gen AI projects and PoCs in the pipeline, which would amount to an estimated current deal pipeline of $150-250 million, according to data accessed by Moneycontrol from market intelligence firm UnearthInsight. In contrast, global rival Accenture alone as of its first quarter (it follows a September-August financial year) has a pipeline worth $450 million and an estimated 450 projects and PoCs.  For Accenture, this was a 50 percent jump in Gen AI opportunities in the pipeline from $300 million in the last six months of FY23 to $450 million in the September-November quarter or the first quarter of FY24.  Though the managements of most top companies including Accenture and its Indian competitors Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HCL Technologies (HCLTech) and LTIMindtree among others threw in a caveat that the project sizes continue to remain smaller at sub-$1 million, average projects sizes for domestic IT services companies are even smaller.  Some projects being at PoC stages with existing long-standing clients may not also generate revenue immediately, and some experimentations are being done free of cost as well, analysts said  According to UnearthInsight’s estimates, Indian IT companies are seeing relatively smaller average revenue of around $0.4-0.6 million per generative AI project compared to $0.8-1 million revenue per project clocked by global counterparts.    &amp;nbsp;    What companies said  According to TCS, it has close to 250 different initiatives and proposal programmes around Gen AI in the pipeline, the same as Q2. The company has heavily invested in training more than 150,000 associates in AI capabilities. TCS is also setting up an AI arena to train more employees, though CEO K Krithivasan has shared that these are small projects.  When asked if competition from companies like Accenture is a concern, he told Moneycontrol last month, “We are engaged with our customers in almost all verticals across multiple geographies. I don't think we are behind there. As more and more proof points emerge and business cases are able to be worked out, you will see more of them coming into production.”  Last month, Accenture’s chief executive Julie Sweet said that the company invests $1 billion annually on training its workforce on generative artificial intelligence. Moreover, Accenture is investing $3 billion over the next three years into its data and AI practice.  HCLTech, at present, is working on around 170 Gen AI PoCs across various industries. During the company’s Q3 earnings conference call last month, CEO C Vijayakumar had said, “While we see great potential in generative AI in the near term, the programmes in this segment will be small. We signed 31 deals in Gen AI but most of them were sub-million-dollar kind of ticket sizes. We are expecting them to ramp up in the coming quarters.”  Infosys’ last updated number was from its annual general meeting in June 2023, where the company said it had about 50 active client projects that were leveraging Gen AI capabilities. Infosys did go on to win some big deals with Gen AI as a component of the offering, such as the $454-million Danske Bank one.  Speaking to Moneycontrol last month, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh had said that the company’s clients are charged up about Gen AI and how it could transform their businesses. “Generative AI is a fundamental change in technology and we are fortunate that we are in somewhat of a leadership position,” he said.  Wipro meanwhile is investing $1 billion over the next three years to advance its AI capabilities, and plans to train 250,000 employees in AI skills.  According to Phil Fersht, CEO, consultancy HFS Research, the industry is going through an inflection point where AI capabilities are becoming the key factor in technology investments, as opposed to the old model of merely investing in a greater number of developers and support personnel.  “This pivot will take several quarters to mature and reap financial outcomes based on co-innovation partnerships and provider investments in their capabilities,” he said.  He added, “Currently all the big four Indian heritage firms understand this shift but the reality will be which of them can make the right investments and keep hold of their capable executives.  It is not clear this year which of them are going to emerge from this the strongest.”  Is Accenture really outperforming?  While it is too early to declare a clear winner in the Gen AI race, analysts do believe Accenture to have an edge over rivals for now.  To give a comparison, Accenture has invested in 50,000 Microsoft Co-Pilot licences, while the top four Indian IT firms have barely each invested in a few hundred, Fersht highlighted.  “The ground reality is that enterprise clients do not expect to pay a lot for generative AI projects (average spend is about $1-2 million per client), and expect a lot of free proof-of-concept work.  Meanwhile, Accenture is betting the farm on generative AI and will help drive the market for the rest of the industry,” he said.  According to Gaurav Vasu, founder and CEO, UnearthInsight, Accenture has four distinct differentiators. It has a matured data and analytics practice which helps identify potential clients with generative AI adoption readiness. The IT services major also has a consulting practice that gives it an edge as it can help provide end-to-end strategy to execution services to return on investment (ROI)/business impact, Vasu said.  “Accenture has early-mover use cases and generative AI talent. It has a team of over 1,000 Gen AI experts, which built vertical and functional Gen AI use cases across industry. This falls under the 80,000-plus data and AI trained team. The company has already acquired more than 10 AI-first companies, helping quickly strengthen capability stack and talent,” he told Moneycontrol.  Accenture has also been marketing its AI gains well, said Ray Wang, CEO of strategic advisory services firm Constellation Research. “We see a difference in how generative AI profits are counted. Indian service providers are in many deals but Accenture has been out-marketing the competition,” he said.  However, while Accenture and its peers may have a strong pipeline of PoCs at work, seeing consistent revenue generation will still take some time. Also, not all PoCs will ultimately go into long-term production converting into multi-year deals.  “There are many pilots under way but it seems clear that the vast majority of these will not enter production in 2024. Another complicating factor is that at this time it is not clear that Gen AI will unleash the 4X multiple of tech to services spending that other tech lead waves have resulted in,” said Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of management consulting firm Everest Group.  Bendor-Samuel said that till date the revenue generated for services firms from Gen AI has been modest. He doesn’t view the $450-million pipeline from Accenture as indicative that it will be ultimately able to unleash a gusher of revenue from generative AI.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/accentures-450-million-gen-ai-pipeline-is-more-than-the-top-10-indian-it-companies-combined-12195021.html

infosys,2024-01-30T10:56:23+05:30,Reshab Shaw,Overhiring or AI impact: Indian IT firms divided on why employee headcount is declining,The industry is divided over whether disruptive technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) are making certain jobs redundant.,"India's leading information technology companies are divided on the impact of disruptive technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), on job redundancy. The industry is witnessing a divergence of opinions within its key players regarding the extent to which emerging technologies might replace certain roles.  However, industry leaders argue that their employee headcounts are expected to increase once demand rebounds. In the interim, major companies such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and others plan to enhance efficiency by leveraging their current talent pool rather than reducing it.  The Indian IT sector, one of the country's largest private sector employers, has traditionally engaged in extensive hiring from colleges. However, recruitment in this industry, which boasts a workforce of over 54 lakhs, has been restrained due to sluggish demand. This downturn is a consequence of macroeconomic uncertainty and anticipations of a recession in key markets.  As a result, a continued decline in headcount has been witnessed, on an average, in the past couple of quarters.  Reports suggest that financial year 2023-24 could be the first in 25 years that the $250-billion industry will end up with fewer employees than it started with.  “The reality is that many of us hired aggressively over the last few years… there has been a slow demand environment over (financial year) 2023-24 and I think it’s just the after-effects of that,” Wipro’s Executive Chairman Rishad Premji said on January 18 while speaking to Moneycontrol.  In Q3, India’s top four IT companies reported a reduction of over 20,000 employees. Even in Q2, India's top three IT companies had reported a decline of over 21,000 in the workforce.  Infosys chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director (MD) Salil Parekh said his company is making sure that it becomes more efficient by not hiring people at this stage in a big way.  “The work that we’re seeing is more focused on cost and automation, and so as the digital, cloud, or Gen AI programmes begin, we will start to see more expansion,” Parekh said, while speaking to Moneycontrol in Davos.  The Bengaluru-based IT services major saw its headcount shrink by 6,101 in the October-December quarter, making it the fourth consecutive quarter it ended with fewer employees.  K Krithivasan, CEO and MD of India’s largest IT company, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), said the company decided not to backfill attrition and deploy employees internally when it first saw weakness in demand. “So that's the reason you find that our… fresh recruitment is slower than the attrition,” Krithivasan said in Davos.  TCS' headcount plunged by 5,680 on a net basis in Q3, which was its second consecutive quarterly decline.  But the Tata-group company is still hiring and any increase in headcount will reflect a demand uptick, Krithivasan said. “Only when we get a much better handle on the demand outlook will I be able to tell you when you would see a positive (headcount); we need to have better demand visibility.”  Nonetheless, all the executives expressed optimism about the long-term prospects of the industry.  “The demand for engineering talent, for programming talent, for design talent, is not going to diminish. So, in the medium to long run, I am very optimistic about the business,” Mohit Joshi, CEO and MD of Tech Mahindra, told Moneycontrol in his first media interaction since taking over the role in December.  Gen AI: Boom or gloom?  While agreeing that headcount will get back on track sooner or later, the executives were split in their assessment of whether Gen AI has already started replacing or making certain job roles redundant. Wipro and HCLTech said this nascent technology is not the reason headcount is reducing. TCS, on the other hand, said the net reduction was a fallout of some amount of “automation” and “production gain.”  Wipro’s Premji said he would “not argue” that the reduction in headcount is because of the elements of “disruptive productivity coming into play on scale” to change the hiring quotient.  HCLTech’s CEO and MD C Vijayakumar had a more nuanced view, saying there are three aspects to determine whether jobs are being made redundant or not by Gen AI. Firstly, he said business process outsourcing will definitely see job cuts. Second, software development will see efficiency improvement by 10-30 percent, albeit at a gradual pace. And finally, managed services and application infrastructure support is already highly automated, being driven by machine learning and hyper automation solutions, Vijayakumar pointed out.  “So effectively, I don't see this (Gen AI) to be reducing headcount. There's going to be a lot more work around Gen AI and all of that, I think that will more than offset in the next set of discretionary spends,” Vijayakumar added.  All in all, the IT industry bosses have a positive long-term outlook, though they anticipate short-term challenges stemming from the industry-wide slowdown, translating into a decline in headcount.

However, large scale adoption of the nascent technology of Gen AI is yet to be seen, said chief executive officers of the top IT companies while speaking to Moneycontrol at the recently concluded World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  The broad consensus that green shoots are perceivable on the horizon by the who’s-who of the IT world assumes significance as these companies have struggled in the past couple of quarters with tepid demand leading to muted quarterly performance. Macroeconomic uncertainty in their key markets and the fear of recession had led clients to put a cap on IT and discretionary spending.  “I definitely see signs of green shoot,” said Rishad Premji, Executive Chairman, Wipro, further saying, “I want to be sort of sensitive that it's green shoots… (and) as I look out over the last few weeks, certainly things seem to be opening up a little bit more.”  For October-December, the IT services company reported a fall in net profit, which is the fourth consecutive quarter of fall in profits.  India’s largest IT company, Tata Consultancy Services’ Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director (MD) K Krithivasan said he sees optimism and clients wanting to do more. Asked about a timeline on when discretionary spending would return, Krithivasan said although it's too early to tell but “sometimes when you're not having a bad news is good news.”  He further said the company would more or less have a clear view of client’s annual technology budgets by the middle of the January-March quarter. “Budget is no longer that sacrosanct… as the customers see more opportunity, they are willing to recalibrate the budget, invest more or dial down,” Krithivasan said, while speaking to Moneycontrol on January 17.  Clients usually prepare their annual tech budgets during the start of the year, which is indicative of the change in spending when compared to the previous year.  Initial calculations suggest that budgets have remained the same as last year, Krithivasan said.  HCLTech’s CEO and MD C Vijayakumar also joined in unison, saying he sees a sense of optimism on a number of areas. He said Davos 2024 seems to be filled with technology conversations, more than any other year that he has attended so far.  “Everybody is navigating a phase of uncertainty and change at the same time,” said Cognizant’s Chief Executive Officer Ravi Kumar S. “In the last 40-50 years, only very few times, people have navigated periods of change and uncertainty together.”  Ravi Kumar said clients are looking at more cost-out deals, which is another broader trend the IT industry has been witnessing. The savings thus generated, he said, will be deployed for integrating AI into enterprise landscapes.  Gen AI  In the gathering of business leaders and other prominent personalities in the Alps, the tech titans were seen sharing a blend of enthusiasm for Gen AI, and also being cautiously optimistic for it.  Generative AI refers to a class of AI models and systems that are designed to generate content, such as text, images, audio, or even video, similar to what a human might create, relying on learned patterns from extensive data rather than explicit programming.  India’s second-largest IT company Infosys said clients are charged up about Gen AI and the type of change that it can make for their businesses.  However, the company did not see any change in actual buying in Q3, CEO and MD Salil Parekh said while speaking to Moneycontrol at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 18.  “There are some use cases, which are very significant, huge benefits that they can get,” Parekh said. Adding that there was a lot of focus on cost, efficiency, and automation programmes in the December quarter.  Parekh said there are some use-cases in generative AI where the benefits are incredible such as customer service, software development, and knowledge areas. “My sense is, as the economic environment also improves, people will look say let's start big programs on that,” he said.  “Generative AI is a fundamental change in technology and we are fortunate that we are in somewhat of a leadership position,” Parekh said.  If Infosys believes it is in a leadership position, HCLTech says it is playing a very important role in navigating through the uncertainties of a client’s journey in adopting of Gen AI. “I think there is optimism on what the technology (Gen AI) can do, but there is also a lot of uncertainties and the associated risks with some of the adoption of some of the technologies,” said Vijayakumar. “So I think that's driving a little bit of caution… So there is cautious optimism.”  But what's driving this? Vijayakumar said multiple factors are at play here, “but the way they translate to clients is they need to get more efficient, they need to reduce costs, they need to bring in hyper-automation.”  However, IT companies face another challenge while transitioning prototypes into production-grade work. “When you actually apply AI to consumer-grade work, it's relatively easy. When you apply to enterprise grade work, it is hard,” said Cognizant’s Ravi Kumar.’  Nonetheless, all eyes will be on when demand bounces back and the fructification of generative AI into meaningful revenue, going forward.

Despite forming a small Doji candle, the ability to stay above the previous day’s high suggests the possibility of a bullish reversal.  Moving forward, it's crucial for the index to maintain ground above the 21-day EMA, prompting a swifter retracement and triggering short-covering. The immediate trading range for the index is estimated at 21,500 to 21,800.  Conversely, Nifty Bank experienced volatility despite a strong initial session. With mounting pressure on heavyweight HDFC Bank and upcoming results from ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, the index could face continued strain.  The robust support zone of 45,400-44,800, formed by a bullish gap, is critical, and breaching it might lead to a more significant corrective move. Currently, Bank Nifty needs to establish a foundation at the support zone while aiming for a rapid ascent above the immediate resistance at 46,100.

JSW Energy: Buy | LTP: Rs 501 | Stop-Loss: Rs 485 | Target: Rs 550 | Return: 9.7 percent  The stock is presently trading at an all-time high, signaling strong momentum in its current trend. Notably, the stock has recently witnessed an upsurge in trading volumes, underscoring the enthusiasm in the trend.  Furthermore, the RSI being above the 50 mark indicates the presence of positive momentum, further affirming the strength and potential continuation of the upward trend in JSW Energy.  Going ahead, we expect the prices to move higher till the mark of Rs 485 where the stop-loss must be Rs 550 on a daily closing basis.    GAIL India: Buy | LTP: Rs 168.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 162 | Target: Rs 183.5 | Return: 9 percent  The trend in stock has gained momentum, evident from the increasing steepness in its trajectory.

Forest department officials confirmed the big cat's presence based on pugmarks and have installed cameras and a cage to capture it, the Times of India reported.  The incident came to light after a few passersby out for a morning walk saw a leopard leaping into the Infosys campus on Super Corridor. They informed the security guards and the forest department was also alerted, district forest officer Mahendra Singh Solanki told the publication.  &quot;During the search operation, the team has found pugmarks of the leopard that confirmed its presence in the area,&quot; he said. TCS and Infosys have their campus spread over 230 acres of land that has dense foliage making it a suitable place for the leopard to hide.  The forest department has also asked employees of TCS and Infosys to stay inside the buildings and not to stay in the open areas unnecessarily. &quot;We have asked the staff not to go towards the dense plantation inside the campus, where the presence of the leopard has been confirmed by its pugmarks. Besides, morning and evening walkers have been asked to stay alert, carry lathi and torch, and avoid going near the bushes,&quot; Solanki said.  He added that after a day-long search, the forest department has installed trap cameras and a cage at a strategic location to catch the animal.  &quot;The population of leopards has increased multifold compared to the tigers and lions as there are many reasons for it, including strict actions on their poaching, their good survival rate and dependency on small prey and skills to adjust in any weather and conditions,&quot; Solanki told the Times of India. &quot;Infighting for territory due to increasing their population, along with deforestation and increasing number of farmhouses, residential and other projects in the jungle can be blamed for reporting a rise in such incidents of leopards entering human habitat in the recent past.&quot;  Read more: Leopard found hiding inside bedroom of Nashik home, captured.

infosys,2024-01-17T13:03:57+05:30,Reshab Shaw,Europe market outperforms North America in Q3 for IT cos; demand to return in H1FY25,"According to analysts, early signs show that the weakness has bottomed out. In fact, one of them said IT services business will see a possible rebound soon, irrespective of whether the US cuts interest rates or not. ","Europe has performed better than the North American market for the top four Indian IT companies including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech and Wipro, which reported their December quarter earnings last week, as they continue to bag more projects from the UK and continental Europe region, say experts.  Execution of some large deals and subsiding of the ill-effects caused by the Russia-Ukraine war crisis were some other reasons that drove UK and continental Europe to pip the North American market in terms of growth, experts have said.  They also feel demand is expected to bounce back for IT companies, in general, in the second half of this calendar year 2024.  The North American market contributes approximately 60 percent to the total revenue for most IT companies, and Europe in the 30 percent range.  India’s largest IT firm Tata Consultancy Services’ (TCS) United Kingdom market grew 8.1 percent year on year (YoY), while continental Europe grew 0.5 percent in the same period. For the North American market, TCS’ revenue declined by 3 percent YoY in constant currency (CC) terms.  Bengaluru-based Infosys’ share of revenue from the European region grew by over 9 percent YoY to 28.2 percent. In CC terms, the region’s contribution to revenue grew 5 percent. The share of revenue from the North American region grew by 4.7 percent YoY.  “There is… more activity in Europe, most specifically in the UK, to get some large engagements over the line,” said Phil Fersht, CEO, HFS Research.  HCLTech’s revenue share from the region was flat at 29 percent, in a quarter when revenue from Americas increased by 1.6 percent to 64.5 percent. For the American market, HCLTech’s revenue was up 6.7 percent YoY in CC terms. HCLTech doesn't provide the break-up for its North American market.  Wipro’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Thierry Delaporte said the company has won four large deals in Europe for the third quarter, despite the continuing economic weakness.  “These new, four transformative deals add up to nearly $300 million in bookings. These deals underscore the success of our strategy in this market,” Delaporte said.  Nonetheless, Wipro posted a decline in revenue share from the European region by almost 4 percent. However, its share of revenue from the American market increased.    “For every service provider, Europe has been doing better than North America,” said Pareekh Jain, Chief Executive Officer and lead analyst at Pareekh Consulting. Companies are winning more cost-takeout deals in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, Jain said.  Cost-takeout is a term used by IT companies to describe deals that are placed with them to increase productivity and reduce spending.  “We see lower traction for digital transformation programmes and more activity for cost and efficiency programmes,” Infosys CEO and MD Salil Parekh said, while addressing a press conference on January 11.  Top Indian IT companies have continued to gain favour among enterprise customers in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway and others, according to data accessed by Moneycontrol from market intelligence firm UnearthInsight.  This was despite cuts in tech budgets and macroeconomic weaknesses persisting in the overall European and US markets.  Going forward, the ongoing crisis in the Red Sea might have a sentimental impact on consumer care companies as supply-chain routes continue to remain disrupted, Jain said.  Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October, the Red Sea has been in the news for periodic attacks on commercial vessels by Houthi rebels of Yemen. The Red Sea strait is crucial for 30 percent of global container traffic and 12 percent of global trade.  For the December quarter, overall demand remained tepid and experts do not expect any improvement till the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024.  Kotak Securities’ vice president, fundamental research, Sumit Pokharna, said demand outlook is improving but there's low visibility on a meaningful recovery of discretionary spends.  “The pick-up in discretionary spending can aid the overall return to industry growth. The long-term growth prospects for the sector remain strong,” he said.  Deal wins  Nonetheless, the Street expects IT companies to close many large deals over the next two quarters or six months, at a time when deal wins did not impress experts.  “There are a host of large deals in the market being discussed and there is definitely a more positive view on more deals coming to fruition over the next couple of quarters,” said Phil Fersht, CEO, HFS Research.  Ashutosh Sharma, vice president and research director at Forrester, said that there are some mega deals in the pipeline right now, but those are all invariably vendor consolidation projects.  “So what's happening right now is that there's a lot of spending reallocation that the clients are doing in the hope of optimising their overall spend. I spoke to a couple of firms. One firm said that 100 percent of their loads pretty much were vendor consolidation (deals),” Sharma said.  Vendor consolidation deals are undertaken primarily to reduce costs and increase efficiency.  The top four Indian IT companies reported sequentially low deal wins, for the quarter that ended in December 31, with the exception of Wipro. To be sure, the number of deal wins were in line with the Street’s predictions.  This came after an all-time high total contract value (TCV) for most of these companies. In Q3, TCS’ TCV stood at $8.1 billion, without winning a single large deal during the quarter. Infosys won large deals worth $3.2 billion, of which 71 percent was net new deals. It was still significantly low as compared to $7.7 billion in large deals last quarter.  HCLTech’s quarterly TCV dropped to $1.92 billion, down both on a YoY basis and sequentially. Wipro was the only exception, which saw a slightly higher TCV at $3.8 billion.    Demand recovery and rate cut  Most analysts are of the view that demand will bounce back by the second half of this calendar year. Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO of market intelligence and research firm Everest Group, believes that whether interest rates in the US are cut or not, the IT services business will see a possible rebound soon.  He is not alone.  According to Jain, early signs show that the weakness has bottomed out and that demand should improve from the second half onwards.  “If interest rates are cut, it will impact all secondary industries. This is because people will be more interested to invest in discretionary spends,” Jain told Moneycontrol.  While the median projection by US Federal Reserve officials highlights that interest rates will be 50 basis points lower than projections made earlier, companies say the impact or optimism stemming from expectations of rate cuts are yet to be seen in the form of client spending.  &quot;The optimism around interest rates has not resulted in a reduction of the uncertainty that we see in decision making. The sentiments have remained the same, so I don’t think we are not ready to say that it will recover by Q4,” K Krithivasan, CEO and MD, TCS, said during the company’s earnings conference on January 11.  HCLTech CEO and MD C Vijayakumar, concurred, saying his company is facing a similar situation.  Also read: Discretionary spending remains same as Q2, don’t see an uptick: HCLTech CEO  “There is significant political pressure to cut rates but a premature move could be very expensive in the long run. We believe that the possible start of a rebound in two quarters will likely move forward with or without rate cuts,” Bendor-Samuel said.  However, going by the recent jump in ADRs (American Depository Receipts) of Infosys and Wipro, despite a cautious commentary on demand, it could be inferred that investors believe recovery for the sector is on the horizon.  “As we look to Q4, the tailwinds are being driven but a generally more positive economic outlook, declining inflation, and a determination from some leading providers to include more value in selected engagement bids to close business,” Fersht said.

Wipro is the only IT services company among the Top 10 whose brand value declined 7.6 percent ","The brand value of Accenture grew to $40.5 billion in 2024, while that of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reached $19.2 billion, as both the IT services giants continue to top Brand Finance IT Services 25 2024 list.  While Accenture’s growth was driven by its promising work in the generative AI mega trend, TCS added $2 billion on-year to its brand value through consistent brand and marketing investments. Some of its prominent sponsorships include Formula E, its partnership with Jaguar which gives TCS visibility on key audiences, building awareness and familiarity, but it also acts as a showcase for TCS capabilities, enhancing reputation and consideration.  Wipro was the only IT services major to have an erosion in brand value by 7.6 percent on a year-on-year basis. Apart from the company’s troubles with turning around the business in challenging marco environment, it also saw more than 10 of its top executives quit in 2023.  HCLTech grew the fastest at 16 percent on a year-on-year basis, among the top 10 companies. Its brand value stood at $6.5 billion. This jump came from significant sponsorship deals with sporting brands such as New York Giants and New York Jets.  According to the Brand Finance research, HCLTech chief executive C Vijayakumar also topped the category of becoming a sustainability champion in the IT services sector.  In a five-year period, Infosys grew the fastest, touching $14.2 billion in brand value. The company’s brand value grew 9.3 percent on a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR).  “Under the leadership of CEO Salil Parekh, who has recently ascended as the number one CEO in the IT services sector in the Brand Finance Brand Guardianship Index 2024, the company has consistently delivered strong brand value growth amid rapidly evolving and challenging market conditions,” the report said.    “While IT services brands thrived during the pandemic's digital transformation boom, a current slowdown driven by macroeconomic headwinds, inflation, and geopolitical tensions has them rethinking their strategies,” Lorenzo Coruzzi, valuation director at Brand Finance, said in a statement.  “Despite cautious short-term spending, the substantial long-term demand for AI presents a crucial opportunity for IT services brands to adapt and differentiate themselves,” he added.  Among countries, India topped the list bringing 32.57 percent brand value created, beating countries including Ireland, the US, Japan, France.

infosys,2024-01-15T13:57:53+05:30,Nandita Khemka,"After Q3 numbers, TCS edges out Infosys as a near-term pick: Apurva Prasad","Even as IT stocks defy seasonality with strong performances, the HDFC Securities vice president for institutional research says the Tata Group company has scope for sustained outperformance.","Shares of information technology companies have been on a roll after the big names sprang a positive surprise in the third quarter. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HCL Tech and Wipro topped margins estimates despite the seasonality factor. With a 6 percent quarterly growth in constant currency revenues, HCL Tech managed to outshine its peers.  For the sector as a whole, healthy deal wins and a drop in the employee attrition rate were the other highlights of the quarter. Management commentaries further contributed to the optimistic outlook, with TCS suggesting a potential turnaround in the BFSI or banking, financial services and insurance segment and anticipated growth in the upcoming quarter. Wipro's leadership has also signalled green shoots in discretionary demand.  But what does the pecking order look like following the better-than-expected quarterly showing? In an interview with Moneycontrol, Apurva Prasad, vice president, institutional research, HDFC Securities, says he prefers tech bellwether TCS over Infosys as it is poised to continue its outperformance in the coming quarters. Edited excerpts:  The big four have reported their numbers. The trend has been set as Q3 earnings have beaten muted expectations. So looking at the top four, which one is emerging //emerged// as a clear winner in Q3? Would you say it's HCL Tech given the fact that it has reported industry-beating revenue growth?  Yes, we were expecting HCL Tech to outperform in the quarter and they seem to have done that, but in the services space the outperformance is not very significant. But in any case, it sets up the company for an outperformance in FY24 and this outperformance should also likely continue in FY25. So HCL Tech, I would say, would be the best out of the top four.  TCS, relative to some of the headwinds that the company has been facing and what they've delivered, especially on margins and with some of their goalposts that they had by end of year, I think there is an upside potential in margins for the company. Broadly, the visibility of some recovery over the next few quarters and, therefore, growth rates improving for most of these companies would be a factor that is important. But what we prefer is HCL Tech and TCS within the bigger ones.  Also Read: Can’t take equity capital flows for granted even if Fed cuts rates: Neelkanth Mishra  So what is the pecking order looking like now? Would you prefer Infosys over TCS given the fact that the stock has also underperformed vis-a-vis its peers?  While Infosys has historically maintained a discount of about 15-16 percent compared to TCS, which remains consistent, I believe TCS is poised to continue its outperformance. The period during which Infosys outpaced TCS was characterised by substantial growth. However, looking ahead, I don't foresee Infosys replicating that trend in the next couple of years due to specific company challenges. There is an increased reliance on the pass-through element in some of their significant deals, which is not an ideal starting point given the current circumstances. Although there is an anticipated recovery for Infosys, with FY25 expected to fare better than FY24, I still lean towards TCS as my preferred choice. The attrition rate has come down, so on the supply side things have improved, but if you look at the headcount, we saw a second straight quarter of decline for both Infosys and TCS. Do you think the trend will continue at least for the next few quarters?  Yes, there should be a recovery on the hiring front in the next quarter or two. There is still considerable capacity in the form of a bench that provides companies like Infosys the opportunity to enhance their utilisation. The hiring strategies that preceded this period enabled them to maintain relatively lower gross hire levels and adopt just-in-time hiring methodologies, even on the campus side post-COVID. This approach allows companies to align their hiring more closely with demand rather than building a surplus, as was done previously. So, I think some of these optimisations would continue.  Also Read: HCL Tech up 4%, extend gains as brokerages raise EPS estimates on Q3 beat  Subcontracting is another form of delivery that companies have optimised and there is still enough room for reduction in that aspect. So the operational levers are looking quite favourable for the company. Notably, attrition rates are currently lower than the historical average for companies, and the cost of replacement is no longer a significant challenge. I think those factors should start to help, especially as even onshore wage inflation seems to be coming down. That is a bigger cost element. So normalisation of these factors would be another thing that would work in their favour. So margins look quite fair.  Anything catching your fancy from the mid-cap IT pack? Given the fact that mid-cap IT has performed better than large-caps, do you think valuations are stretched here?  Persistent Systems stands out within the midcap IT sector, presenting an attractive opportunity. I anticipate the company will maintain its trend of outperforming its peers, with the potential for margin improvement. Therefore, Persistent Systems is expected to outshine its counterparts. Within the smaller names, Birla Soft witnessed a turnaround in the last quarter, and this positive trajectory is likely to persist.

In fact, the Nifty 50 comes closer to the much-awaited psychological 22,000 mark. Given the strong optimism, the bulls are likely to take the Nifty 50 to the 22,000-22,200 zone in near term with an immediate support at 21,800-21,700 levels, followed by crucial support at 21,500 mark, experts said, but they expect some consolidation post the achievement of said target zone.  During the last week, the Nifty 50 climbed 0.85 percent to end at new closing high of 21,894.55 and formed bullish candlestick pattern with long lower shadow on the daily charts, continuing higher highs for seventh consecutive week.  &quot;At the current juncture, the milestone of 22,000 is just a step away and with the structural setup, 22,100-22,150 is the next potential target for the current week starting from January 15,&quot; Osho Krishan, senior analyst - technical &amp;amp; derivative research at Angel One said.  On the lower end, he feels 21,800-21,750 should now act as a cushion for any short-term blip, while strong support lies around the 21,600-21,500 zone.  Jigar Patel, senior manager - equity research at Anand Rathi looks more bullish than Osho, saying the rally above 22,000 could move towards 22,200-22,400 in the current week.  He feels the reading of long-short ratio of FII index futures suggests that Nifty still has some upside potential, but this could be the final stage of the rally, after which the market could see strong profit-taking in the market.  Meanwhile, the experts' stance remains bullish, but they advised that one needs to stay light on positions.  Moneycontrol collated a list of top 10 stock ideas for healthy return with the next 3-4 weeks perspective. The closing price of January 12 considered for the stock return calculation.

Additionally, on the daily charts, the counter has given a breakout from its sloping channel formation.  The upmoves in the counter suggest a new leg of bullish trend from the current levels.    L&amp;amp;T Finance Holdings: Buy | LTP: Rs 167.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 160 | Target: Rs 180 | Return: 7.4 percent  After the remarkable up move, the stock is having a breather from last few sessions.

The formation suggests at further bullish movement from the current levels.  Expert: Ashwin Ramani, derivatives analyst at SAMCO Securities  Infosys: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,613 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,550 | Target: Rs 1,750 | Return: 8.5 percent  The IT major has been moving in a higher high higher low formation since making a low of Rs 1,185 on April 17, 2023. The stock with a current market price (CMP) of Rs 1,613, had multiple resistance around Rs 1,600 levels, having failed to sustain above the same since April 2022. The maximum Call open interest, which is the resistance for the stock, is placed at 1,600 strike.  The Future open interest (OI) indicated buildup of fresh long positions in Index futures supported by a spike in volumes. Short covering coupled with strong Put writing at 1,600 strike can fuel the fresh leg of rally in this stock.  A follow up buying from the current levels can lead to the price moving higher until Rs 1,750 levels in the next one month. The level of Rs 1,550 on the downside is expected to act as a support for the stock. It is advisable to buy at the current level with a stop-loss of Rs 1,550 and a target of Rs 1,750.

Perhaps at the foremost of the rise was Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy, who was one of the seven men who founded the company in 1981 and paved the way for several others to hop on the path of IT development in India.  But the 77-year-old nearly did not play a pivotal role in Infosys' growth as he recently revealed that Wipro's Azim Premji told him that not hiring Murthy was one of the biggest mistakes he made.  &quot;Azim (Premji) once told me that one of the biggest mistakes he committed was not to hire me,&quot; Murthy told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.  Additionally, both Murthy and his wife Sudha Murty admitted that had things turned out differently, Premji and Wipro may not have had any competition.  Interestingly, Wipro's connection in Murthy's life is not merely restricted to Premji not hiring him. The couple's mutual friend Prasanna, who went on to become the CMO at Wipro, played a key role in their relationship. Prasanna was Murty's co-worker at Telco, now known as Tata Motors.  In October, Murthy had said, in a podcast, that if India's overall work productivity needed to improve then the country's youth needed to work 70 hours in a week.

However, HCL Tech is the sole outlier among these IT firms, which reported an increase of 3,617 employees for the quarter.  When asked about the declining headcount, HR heads unanimously said they would first put the existing workforce to use. The executives added that hiring will be resumed if and when demand picks up pace.  Comparatively, these four companies had reported a decline in the workforce by 21,213 in the second quarter, mainly driven by the above-cited reasons.  Reduction in headcount was the sharpest for Infosys, which dropped by 6,101 to 3,22,663 in the third quarter. Next in line was India's largest IT services company TCS, whose employee count dropped by 5,680 to 603,305. Trailing them is Wipro, which reported a decline of 4,473 employees to end with 240,234 in the quarter ended December.  Tata Consultancy Services  Milind Lakkad, Chief HR Officer, TCS, said the company has made significant investments in the past few years. &quot;(We are) continuing to leverage that investment today and driving business that way and not needing to hire more,&quot; Lakkad said, while addressing a press conference after declaring the December quarter results.  Nonetheless, the company said it has commenced its campus hiring process for FY2024-25.  “We are committed to hiring from college campuses and growing talent organically. We have commenced our campus hiring process for the next year and see tremendous excitement among freshers to join TCS,” Lakkad added.  Infosys  For Infosys, outgoing Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy said that the company has a lot of headroom for utlisation levels to go up, implying that the company doesn't need to hire currently.  Roy said Infosys' comfort range for utilisation levels is between 84-85 percent.  He said the company can increase employee deployment by taking more trainees on short notice.  &quot;So our model is very flexed in terms of ability to recruit fast, train them fast, and put them on production. So in that sense, we are in a good space in terms of ability to capture any future growth (in demand),&quot; Roy said.  India’s second largest IT services company will also skip campus hiring, Roy said.  Wipro  Bengaluru-based IT major Wipro started trimming its workforce in the third quarter of the last financial year after having added 577 employees in Q2FY23.  &quot;We believe that we have enough capacity to grow, and as and when demand comes, we will continue to grow (our headcount),&quot; said Saurabh Govil, chief human resources officer, Wipro. &quot;Even now for certain skills, specific technology, we continue to hire.&quot;  Among these four IT companies, Wipro was the only firm whose net utilisation rate, excluding trainees, decreased marginally to 84 percent from 84.5 percent in Q3.  Govil said the marginal decrease in utilisation rate was due to seasonal furloughs and holidays availed by employees.  HCL Tech  Bucking the trend in the IT sector, HCLTech’s net headcount addition has increased Q3, and was in line with the company's plans to start hiring after two quarters of slowdown.  Fresher additions stood at 3,818 for the quarter, up from last quarter’s 3,630.  In Q2, HCL Tech said it has some unutilised capacity, but beyond a point, the company will have to start hiring.  HCLTech’s attrition in the last 12-month basis declined by 140 basis points sequentially to 12.8 percent in Q3. This is the lowest attrition for the company since the COVID-19 quarter in 2021.  An analyst that Moneycontrol spoke to said IT companies are utilising their respective bench strength and not hiring fresh talent as they do not have demand visibility.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/headcount-in-indias-top-3-it-firms-drop-by-over-16000-in-q3-hcl-tech-bucks-trend-12044691.html

infosys,2024-01-12T14:23:10+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,Why TCS and Infosys’ Gen AI commentaries in Q3 felt lacklustre,"Both the companies shied away from sharing definitive numbers around deal pipeline opportunities or outlook on generating revenue from Gen AI. Meanwhile, Accenture is talking about industry leading growth in the technology.","India’s two biggest IT services companies Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys reported their third-quarter earnings for FY24 on January 11. Amidst a seasonally weak quarter and an uncertain demand environment, all eyes were on their generative AI updates, especially with rival Accenture betting big on the opportunity in 2024.  Though both TCS and Infosys spoke about training and skilling 150,000 and 100,000 employees, respectively, in generative AI and AI skills as well as the continued experimentation with the technology by clients; they shied away from sharing definitive numbers or updates on deal pipeline opportunities or prospects of revenue in coming quarters.  This comes at a time when global rival Accenture is betting big on the technology. Despite ongoing uncertainties around the revival of discretionary spending by clients, Accenture expects Gen AI growth to accelerate manifolds in 2024.  During its Q1 FY24 earnings announcement in December, Accenture revealed an industry-leading Gen AI deal pipeline of $450 million in new bookings in a single quarter.  The company said that it expects clients to move from Gen AI experimentation to more proof of concepts and pilots in 2024. Moreover, Accenture is also looking to double down on skilling its data and AI workforce to 80,000 from 40,000 at the beginning of the year.  Earlier in 2023, the company said it would invest $3 billion over the next three years into its data and AI practice.  Meanwhile, TCS said their clients have started getting comfortable with the technology and figuring out how they can drive the most benefit out of it. In Q2, TCS had mentioned that it had 250 generative AI opportunities in the pipeline, but no update was shared on that during the Q3 earnings conference.  K Krithivasan, CEO and MD, TCS, however, said, “The way we see it is the clients are trying to see what benefit they can gain and are doing multiple experimentations like I talked about. Some of the PoCs have moved to production, but they're all small projects.”  TCS COO N Ganapathy Subramaniam said that clients want to try out new things in new areas across technology operations.  “We are continuing with our focus on training majority of our workforce on using Gen AI and coming up with innovative ideas, to improve productivity and efficiency as well as deliver projects and architecture which can evolve on its own. The possibilities that we see for the future is enormous,” He added.  Infosys, during the company’s annual general meeting in June 2023, had mentioned that it had 50 active client projects that are leveraging its Gen AI capabilities.  As for the company’s Q3 earnings on January 11, CEO and MD Salil Parekh said that Infosys is seeing “strong traction” for generative AI programmes leveraging its Topaz offering capabilities and these capabilities have been integrated into its service line portfolio.  “Generative AI is going extremely strong. There’s a lot of activity with clients. For example, we are working on large diverse structural issues. This is a very strategic time where we are working with a large global bank over use large language models to make that risk area better. We have a large number of such deals,” Parekh said.  He added, “We are not at this stage of publicly sharing what the Gen AI revenue. The reaction is endless capability, a good leading market position. In generative AI, we are very strong in the capabilities.”  Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of management consulting firm Everest Group, earlier this month, told Moneycontrol that he believes most of the PoCs undertaken in 2023 will not move into production in 2024.  “This may be as high as 90 percent of the PoCs,” he had said.  “However, the 10 percent which do move (to production) will indicate to the market where Gen AI does work and we expect significant opportunities to arise in these areas for the tech services firms by the third quarter of 2024,” he added.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/why-tcs-and-infosys-gen-ai-commentary-in-q3-felt-lacklustre-12041361.html

Nifty 50 was holding near 21,850 in the afternoon trade on January 12, while the Nifty IT index was at 36,400.  Market leaders Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys (INFY) reported weak quarterly that missed expectations on some counts, and barely met the estimates on others. However, strong deal wins and outlook alleviated concerns about the sector grappling with fears of sluggish demand. Infosys stock rose 7 percent to Rs 1,613, while TCS stock jumped 4 percent post-results, reaching Rs 3,888.  TCS may head to all-time high, Infosys may challenge resistance; watch these levels to buy on dips:  Sameet Chavan, Technical Analyst at Angel One, stated, &quot;All IT counters have started finding their mojo back since the early part of November. Initially, midsize IT counters showed some outperformance, but now it's time for larger peers to catch up. Both Infosys and TCS were in the process of revival, and with the boost from results, the tough times seem to be behind them.&quot;  &quot;Infosys is now confirming its multi-month breakout above Rs 1,592, and from hereon, the tide has turned to 'BUY on dips'. In 2-3 weeks, we would expect it to challenge its major intermediate resistance of Rs 1,670-1,675, with Rs 1,486 becoming a sacrosanct support. As far as TCS is concerned, it is also picking up some pace, and soon we would see it heading towards its all-time high of Rs 4,043.&quot;   Bars in red indicate the change in open interest (OI) of call writers, while green bars show the change in OI of put writers  Akshay Bhagwat, Senior Vice President-Derivatives Research at JM Financial, stated, &quot;Infosys had seen call shorting bets placed ahead of the results. A strong gap up has surprised the call writers, resulting in the unwinding of short bets. The weekly chart structure remains positive, with the recent swing highs of Rs 1,575 being taken off. Momentum should see upside of Rs 1,625-1,660, with a support base building up at Rs 1,550.&quot;   Bars in red indicate the change in open interest (OI) of call writers, while green bars show the change in OI of put writers  On the other hand, TCS had a decent set of quarterly numbers, which provided the impetus for a gap-up open, said Bhagwat. &quot;Post setting up a support base at Rs 3,700, the momentum regaining in this IT major can retest and attempt a breakout above the swing highs of Rs 3,925,&quot; he added.

Revenue declined 1.2% QoQ to USD4.66bn (1% in cc) due to weak discretionary spending, further accentuated by lower volumes because of higher furloughs. EBITM fell 70bps QoQ to 20.5% due to wage hikes (effective 1-Nov-23), cyber security incident partially offset by margin-improvement initiatives under Project Maximus, and currency benefits. Large deal TCV stood at USD3.2bn, with 71% net new (9MFY24 – large deal TCV of USD13.2bn, up 70% YoY; net new TCV of USD7.2bn, up 106% YoY). Infosys has tightened its FY24 revenue growth guidance to 1.5-2% CC (from 1-2.5%), implying -1.5% to 0.5% sequential growth in Q4.  Outlook As per management, the demand environment is largely unchanged, with cost takeout and consolidation deals continuing to see traction.

The growth was aided by strong India performance (up 26% QoQ, partially aided by BSNL deal execution). TCS reported deal wins of USD8.1b (down 28% QoQ but up 3% YoY, book-to-bill ratio at 1.1x), in line with our expectations. EBIT improved 70bp QoQ to 25.0%, 50bp ahead of our estimates, aided by lower subcontracting costs and cost savings, which more than compensated for adverse seasonality. 3Q headcount declined 5.7k (-1% QoQ). Attrition (LTM) declined by 160bp QoQ to 13.3%. TCS expects attrition to continue to soften in the near term. Reported PAT was negatively impacted by a onetime cost of USD115m associated with legal payout to Epic System.

The large deal TCV momentum remained intact at USD3.2b (down 3% YoY, net new at 71%). The management sees strong traction in the large deal pipeline, despite an adverse demand environment. Weakness was visible in parts of Financial, Comm, Retail and Hi-Tech, partially compensated by better demand in Manufacturing, ENU and Life Sciences. The company narrowed its FY24 revenue growth guidance band to 1.5%-2.0% YoY CC from 1.0%-2.5% YoY CC earlier, effectively keeping the mid-point unchanged. EBIT margin declined 70bp QoQ to 20.5%, marginally ahead of our estimate. Profitability was aided by a lower-than-expected wage hike impact of 70bp, partially due to another reduction in workforce (-6.1k, down 190bp QoQ).

Management, while addressing their respective press conferences, indicated that the global macroeconomic environment is still subdued and discretionary spending is still off the hook.  While Tata Consultancy Services posted a year-on-year (YoY) increase of 2 percent in net profit to Rs 11,058 crore in the quarter ended December 31, 2023, its nearest rival Infosys Ltd, reported a 7.3 percent YoY fall in net profit at Rs 6,106 crore in the third quarter of FY24.  Both figures were below Moneycontrol’s consensus poll estimates.  On the revenue front, both companies fared well on a YoY basis. India’s largest IT services exporter recorded a rise of 4 percent to Rs 60,583 crore in Q3FY24, beating Moneycontrol’s consensus estimate of Rs 59,662 crore.  Infosys, too, beat analyst estimates for the topline marginally at Rs 38,821 crore, which was 1.3 percent higher YoY.  TCS CEO K Krithivasan said the optimism around interest rates have not resulted in a reduction of macroeconomic uncertainty that companies have been witnessing in decision­-making. &quot;The sentiment has remained the same, so I don’t think we are not ready to say that it will recover by Q4,” Krithivasan said.  On its part, Infosys said digital programmes have reduced over the last few quarter and it is a wait-and-watch scenario on how the global economic environment turns out, implying that demand uncertainty continues.  Infosys tightened its revenue guidance for the full year to 1.5-2 percent from 1-2.5 percent.  Operating margins or earnings before interest and tax calculated as a percentage of revenue, was a mix for both companies.  TCS’ operating margin rose by 50 basis points to 25 percent YoY, while Infosys’ EBIT margin was down 70 bps to 20.5 percent. Infosys said its margins took a beating because of furloughs, salary hikes, and a cyber-security issue that erupted in the US.  On November 3, Infosys’ US unit, Infosys McCamish Systems, was impacted by a cyber-security attack, resulting in the non-availability of certain applications and systems.  On the deal wins front, TCS reported total contract value (TCV) worth $8.1 billion, missing the company’s quarterly deal win guidance of $9-10 billion. Infosys’ reported a TCV of $3.2 billion, which is lower than last quarter’s record $7.7 billion.  Headcount for both the companies dropped by a huge number in the December quarter.  Infosys saw its headcount shrink by 6,101 for the quarter ending December 31, ending the quarter with 322,663 employees. TCS also saw its headcount plunge by 5,680 on a net basis in the third quarter of FY24, with the employee count standing at 603,305.

Net new deal wins also remained strong, which makes analysts hopeful of a recovery in the coming quarters","Shares of India's second largest IT services company Infosys surged nearly 6 percent in opening trade on January 12 after brokerages expect the worst for the company to be behind on the back of its strong new deal wins in Q3.  At 09.22 am, shares of Infosys were trading at Rs 1,575.10 on the NSE.  Large deal wins for Infosys remained strong at $3.2 billion in Q3, with 71 percent of them being net new deals.  Global brokerage firm Jefferies was impressed with the company's net new order book which stood at $2.2 billion. The brokerage said strong deal wins provide comfort to its expectations of a 13 percent EPS CAGR over FY24-26. It retained its “buy” call on the stock with a price target of Rs 1,740.  Fuelled by similar expectations of a recovery in the coming quarters, the American Depository Receipts (ADRs) of Infosys also settled 4 percent higher at $18.82 on the NYSE overnight.  The third quarter is generally a weak one for Indian IT companies due to the holiday season in the US and Europe, which are their major clients, on account of furloughs and fewer working days.  On that account, the firm reported a 1.7 percent sequential decline in the December profit, well below the Street's estimates.

The brokerage said the Q3 season started with a bit of positivity for Infosys as it reported a beat on the topline, while deal wins remained decent.  The Q3 earnings of Infosys was the first set of decent results after back-to-back disappointments, Nuvama Institutional Equities said. &quot;Deal wins, while modest, had a high share of net new (71 percent), which should boost growth for FY25 and beyond. We upgrade FY24/25/26 estimates by -0.3 percent/1.3 percent/2.2 percent,&quot; the brokerage said in its report.  The firm believes that Q3 could be the bottom for the earnings downgrade cycle for Infosys and it expects strong deal wins of the last few quarters to convert into revenue even as the US macro environment becomes favourable.  Baking that in, Nuvama raised its price target for Infosys to Rs 1,850, while retaining the “buy” call.  Nomura also hailed the company's good execution and strong new deal wins. Since the management commentary didn’t hint towards discretionary demand revival, the firm chose to retain its “neutral” call on the stock with a price target of Rs 1,500.

Experts have expressed uncertainty about the IT results outlook due to an uptick in furloughs and subdued demand for discretionary services in a seasonally weak quarter. While the December quarter is generally considered weak due to the holiday season, the seasonality this time appears higher than usual.  Ahead of the results, here's how technical analysts and traders are positioning themselves:  &quot;The Nifty IT index is grappling to overcome the selling pressure emerging around the 36,000 mark. This hurdle must be surpassed to enter the next leg of upside, said Avdhut Bagkar, Derivatives &amp;amp; Technical Analyst at StoxBox. However, the IT index has a strong support at 34,000. “The current bias ahead of Q3 results remains formidable over the key support of 34,000,&quot; he said.  &quot;If the index fails to adhere to this support, the downside may trigger bearish sentiment for the sector. The index may then drift towards 32,000 and may enter medium-term bearishness,&quot; Bagkar added.  The Nifty IT index was nearly flat at 2.30 pm on January 10, trading at 34,688.  Among IT stocks, HCL Technologies, L&amp;amp;T Technology Services, and Persistent Systems remain optimistic, according to Bagkar, as the upside bias continues to gain bullish momentum. He believes any weakness in these stocks could be viewed for accumulation and may see the price potentially heading into uncharted territories.  &quot;Weak IT stocks include Infosys, LTIMindtree, Mphasis, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro, which, if they fall beneath their respective 50-simple moving averages, may see further downside,&quot; he further added.  Infosys is expected to remain subdued, while TCS may see positive movement with a decisive breach above Rs 3,835: Shiju Koothupalakkal, Technical Research Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher.  According to Shiju Koothupalakkal, Technical Research Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher, ahead of the results, IT stocks such as Infosys are expected to remain subdued and would need a decisive breach above Rs 1,580 to establish some conviction for further upward movement. &quot;At the same time, a break below the crucial support zone of Rs 1,460 shall weaken the bias to anticipate further slide,” said Koothupalakkal.  “On the other hand, TCS can witness some positive move with support maintained near the important Rs 3,635 levels and on the upside, a decisive breach above the Rs 3,835 zone shall further strengthen the trend to anticipate further rise in the coming days,&quot; he added.

The biography, written by Indian-American author Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, covers the early years of Sudha Murty's and Narayana Murthy's lives and is replete with many such nuggets about the couple. Published by Juggernaut Books, &quot;An Uncommon Love: The Early Life of Sudha and Narayana Murthy&quot; is the story of the Murthys' early years - from their courtship to Infosys' founding years and from their marriage to parenthood.  The biography contains the story of how Donn Liles, who headed the New York-based company Data Basics Corporation, made Narayana Murthy sleep in a storeroom. It describes Liles as a temperamental client and was especially unpleasant to Murthy at times.  “He would often delay payments when he could, and Murthy would then be the target of his ire because he would hold his ground, refusing to budge on timely payment for services. Or Donn would not provide timely authorization for Murthy and his Infosys colleagues to book hotels when they had to visit him in Manhattan,” the book reveals.  “Once when Murthy visited the US for client work, Donn made him sleep on a large box in the storeroom, surrounded by cartons, though his home had four bedrooms. Additionally, Murthy had to manage Donn's many last-minute demands for resources,” says the book.  Murthy put up with Donn's behaviour for the sake of his fledgling company, but the box incident truly shocked him. &quot;My mother used to say that a guest was like God, and the way you treated your guests revealed what kind of person you really were,&quot; he told wife Sudha.  &quot;When my father invited someone over without advance notice, she often served the guest her own food and went to sleep without dinner. And here was Donn enjoying a good night's sleep in his luxurious bed after making me spend the night on a big box in a windowless storeroom,&quot; he said, leaving Sudha furious.

infosys,2024-01-09T18:43:50+05:30,Reshab Shaw,"Infosys Earnings Preview Q3 FY24: Lower pass-through revenues, higher furloughs to drag down performance",Analysts believe Infosys will maintain its operating margin guidance of 20-22% for the financial year,"Infosys’ December quarter earnings performance will be marred by lower pass-through revenues, higher-than-usual furloughs, and weak discretionary spending, say analysts. The Street also expects the operating margin of India’s second-largest IT services company to decline due to salary hikes that the company rolled out in November last year.  Pass-through revenues are one-off revenues earned by IT companies. The Bengaluru-based IT services exporter will declare its October-December earnings on January 11.  Infosys’ profit after tax (PAT) for the quarter is expected to rise 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to Rs 6,244 crore, according to an average of six brokerage estimates. Revenue is seen falling by 0.9 percent to Rs 38,630 crore for the quarter, according to average estimates by the same set of brokerages.  Kotak Institutional Equities expects the company to return to sequential revenue growth in the March quarter.  Most brokerages expect Infosys to maintain its revenue guidance for the financial year in the range of 1-2.5 percent. However, analysts at brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities are the only outliers who expect the company to trim its upper end of the guidance by 50 basis points (bps).  In a pre-earnings research note, Axis Capital analysts said, “We expect CC (constant currency) revenue decline of ~1 percent QoQ CC led by higher-than-normal impact of furloughs and likely lower pass-through revenues (which had increased sharply in the Sept ‘23 quarter).”    Margin woes  Analysts expect Infosys’ operating margin to be affected by furloughs and salary hikes.  Seasonal furloughs have been a pain point for Infosys in Q3, as has traditionally been for IT companies in the October–December quarter. Furloughs involve the situation where clients in areas like the US and Europe refrain from compensating outsourced employees from Indian IT firms for specific days when their operations are suspended, typically during Christmas and New Year.  This adversely impacts the profit margins of Indian IT companies, as they have to provide full salaries to their employees even when unable to invoice the client for the furloughed period.  The double whammy of furloughs and salary hikes will lead to Infosys’ operating margin declining by 0.5 percent to 20.7 percent for the quarter ended December, as per the average estimates.  “Margins are expected to be impacted (-110 bps) due to two months of salary hikes impacting the quarter and furloughs,” said Philip Capital analysts’ in a pre-earnings note.  Nonetheless, analysts expect Infosys to maintain its operating margin guidance for the financial year, calculated as earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) as a percentage of revenue.  The company had performed better than expected on the margins front in the July-September quarter, expanding 40 bps sequentially to 21.2 percent. The company has guided its operating margin for the full financial year in the range of 20-22 percent.  Moderating deal wins  The Street also expects Infosys’ deal wins to be muted this quarter. “We don’t expect recent large deal wins to contribute meaningfully as ramp-ups remain weak,” Philip Capital analysts said in a pre-earnings research note. The conversion of revenues from large deals signed in earlier quarters into revenues will also continue to be in focus. This is because IT companies have been struggling to convert their deal pipeline into revenue in the past couple of quarters because of adverse macroeconomic issues.  When the company briefs the media and analysts on Thursday, investors will also be looking for commentary from the management on why the $1.5 billion mega-deal was cancelled.  The value of large deals grew by 58 percent in the last quarter to $7.7 billion in Q2, which was the highest ever recorded in a quarter.  Apart from the above, the Street would also focus on senior management attrition after multiple senior leadership departures. Infosys has seen at least nine senior-level exits in a year, with former chief financial officer Nilanjan Roy being the latest.  The management would be faced with questions on the possible adverse effects emanating from senior management resignations on the operational performance of the company.  Investor focus would also be on the deal pipeline, outcome of the annual client budgeting exercise and its implications for FY25, discretionary spending environment, vertical outlook such as on BFSI, margin levers, attrition, pricing, and ramp-up schedule of recently won large deals.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/infosys-earnings-preview-q3-fy24-lower-pass-through-revenues-higher-furloughs-to-drag-down-performance-12023161.html
infosys,2024-01-09T11:11:46+05:30,Reshab Shaw,IT Q3 FY24 earnings: Five factors to watch out for,"Analysts expect IT companies to report subdued performance in the December quarter on the back of seasonal furloughs, continued cuts in discretionary spends, and tumbling deal announcements, among others","India’s top IT firms will kick off December quarter earnings this week, with TCS being the first to report on January 11. The Street expects IT companies’ third quarter (Q3) earnings to remain subdued because of seasonal furloughs and continued cuts in discretionary spending by clients.  Analysts said in brokerage reports that deal announcements too have dried up compared to the September quarter. This would result in a moderation of total contract value (TCV) after record wins in Q2. For deals won, the Street expects IT companies to have won cost-takeout opportunities mostly.  Cost-takeout is a term used by IT companies to describe deals that are placed with them to increase productivity and reduce spending.  In terms of specific verticals, communications, banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), and retail will likely remain weak, while manufacturing, energy, and travel are relatively better placed.  Here are the top five themes to watch out for in the Q3 earnings of IT companies:  Muted demand  Analysts expect muted demand to continue for IT services companies because of adverse seasonality effects, weak discretionary spending, and project cuts by clients. “Three of the big five IT services companies should report a year-on-year (YoY) and quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) decline in revenues in the December 2023E quarter, while growth for the other two will trickle down to low single digits,” analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said.  Wipro continues to struggle and is expected to report a fourth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue decline. Midcap IT firms, such as L&amp;amp;T Technology Services and KPIT Technologies, have also witnessed growth moderation, although they continue to hold up better compared to their large-cap peers, according to a note by Axis Capital.  Nomura said the void created by a lower number of small-sized and discretionary projects, along with delays in client decision-making and ramp-up of project wins, will, in certain cases, lead to revenue weakness in the near term. The brokerage further said the impact of the current slowdown might extend until FY25.  Furloughs  Q3 has traditionally been a weak quarter for IT due to seasonal furloughs. This comes at a time when firms have been facing a tough demand environment, resulting in pressure on revenue and profits.  Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said high furloughs in the hi-tech and financial services verticals and the pruning of discretionary programmes will lead to muted performance across companies.  Higher-than-usual furloughs, lower working days, and the absence of budget flushes will impact growth across the spectrum of IT companies, analysts at brokerage firm JM Financial said in a research note. The brokerage also said there are a few company-specific factors that would offset, at least partially, the impact of furloughs.  For example, HCL Technologies will benefit from the year-end pick-up in software sales, a two-month incremental contribution from the acquisition of Germany-based automotive engineering services company ASAP, and the ramp-up of the Verizon deal.  Guidance  IT companies have been tinkering with their revenue guidance in the face of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. This trend is expected to continue for the December quarter as well, according to analysts.  Analysts at Brokerage Kotak expect Infosys to cut its revenue growth guidance to 1-2 percent from 1-2.5 percent for FY24. The brokerage also expects HCL Technologies to retain organic revenue growth guidance of 4-5 percent.  In April, Infosys had sharply trimmed its revenue growth projection for the current financial year to 4-7 percent from the 14-16 percent it had projected in the previous financial year. Since then, the company has revised its revenue guidance twice, and it is currently at 1.0-2.5 percent.  Analysts at Kotak expect Wipro to guide its revenue in the range of -1 percent to 1 percent for the March quarter.  Operating margin guidance is expected to be unchanged by companies.  IT budgets  The Street is not on the same page when it comes to the IT budgets of clients.  Nomura said recent interactions with industry participants suggest there is a continued impact of the macroeconomic slowdown and high inflation in developed markets on tech budget outlooks for most of the industries in 2023.  Analysts at Elara Capital said they will monitor the commentary as the macro-economy in the West takes a positive turn, led by inflation moderation and an indication of a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve.  US Federal Reserve officials projected a lower-than-expected policy rate at the end of 2024.  Analysts at Axis Capital, in a report, said the Street will be focused on qualitative and quantitative commentary on 2024 IT spending trends.  Analysts at brokerage Nomura said IT budgets are likely to be prioritised in areas of automation and cost efficiencies in the near term.  Poaching  The spotlight will also be on the poaching wars that have erupted between top firms such as Cognizant, Wipro, and Infosys in recent weeks.  While Wipro has sued two former executives for joining Cognizant, Moneycontrol reported that Infosys has sent Cognizant a missive asking it to desist from poaching top executives.

Here's what it means,Akshata and Rohan Murty would go on for weeks without getting to hear their father's voice especially when Narayana Murthy was working in the US at a time when phone calls were prohibitively expensive at Rs 32 a minute.,"When Narayana Murthy first spoke about having 70-hour weeks, he said it to inspire young professionals, but as he and his wife Sudha Murty clarified later, he was also speaking from experience. The Infosys co-founder spent a major chunk of his life building the company even if it meant sacrificing his time with family -- a point that has been touched upon in a recent book ‘An Uncommon Love: The Early Life of Sudha and Narayana Murthy’ by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, published by Juggernaut Books.  During Narayana Murthy's time spent away from family, his children Akshata and Rohan Murty dearly missed him. An excerpt published by the Times of India stated how  &quot;the quiet Akshata&quot;, who missed Murthy silently, once said that her grandfather was her &quot;real dad&quot; while her father was a &quot;bonus dad&quot;, someone appeared at infrequent moments and tried to make up for his absence with fun activities. But it was not enough.  Akshata and Rohan Murty would go on for weeks without getting to hear their father's voice especially when Narayana Murthy was working in the US at a time when phone calls were prohibitively expensive at Rs 32 a minute. It caused a rift between the children and the father, the edited excerpt published by the Times of India stated.  One day Rohan Murty decided to confront his father. &quot;Who do you love more -- me and Akshata, or Infosys?&quot; he asked him. Taken aback, Narayana Murthy said, &quot;Of course, I love you both the most.&quot; He could, however, see that neither Rohan nor Akshata Murty was convinced, the book claimed.  As for the Infosys co-founder himself, his journey in building the company was not just hard but lonely -- surrounded by much younger and inexperienced colleagues for whom he also felt a great burden of responsibility, the book stated. It added that Narayana Murthy would often dream of floating in space -- a possible subconscious expression of that feeling of intense isolation that made him feel lonely and withdrawn in his own life and marriage.

The gains in the two stocks along with LTIMindtree and HCL Technologies drove the benchmark Nifty IT index a percent higher.  &quot;Despite industry challenges, there is optimism in the sector, which is driven in anticipation of the end of the rate-tightening cycle, which is expected to accelerate the resumption of delayed projects,&quot; said Vinod TP, Research Analyst at Geojit Financial Services.  Analysts expect the IT industry to report a muted sequential growth in the December quarter due to prolonged higher inflation, delay in discretionary projects and a sluggish growth. The October-December period is typically a slow quarter due to the holiday season in the US and European countries, which are the biggest markets for Indian IT firms.  The recent rally in the sector may face volatility in the short-term but substantial weakening was unlikely, analysts said.  ALSO READ: Chasing multibaggers: 5 stocks that jumped from microcap to midcap in AMFI’s rejig  Infosys will kick off the Q3 earnings season when it will report its December quarter numbers on January 11 followed by India’s biggest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies.  Analysts at Elara Securities expect the IT firms to post muted results, with an average constant currency (CC) growth of 1.4-1.6 percent in dollar terms.  &quot;Among tier-1, we expect HCL Tech to outshine with an estimated 4.8 percent quarter-on-quarter CC growth led by both services and products business,” the brokerage firm said in a preview note.  Among tier-2 firms, Persistent Systems may lead with steady quarter on quarter CC growth of 2.7 percent. KPIT Tech is expected to lead the pack in engineering research and development (ER&amp;amp;D) division, the brokerage firm said.  In the past month, TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro have surged up to 13 percent against a 7 percent rise in the Nifty IT index.  The run-up indicated heavy expectations of a recovery in discretionary spending in CY24E, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said.  The brokerage firm prefers Infosys due to valuation comfort and upside potential in the event of significant recovery in discretionary spending.  IT stocks re-rated in the past several months on rate-cut hopes, leading to expensive valuations for many. “Infosys provides comfort around growth acceleration and upside potential. However, upsides are moderate in TCS and HCL Tech after the recent run-up in stock prices,&quot; they said.

infosys,2024-01-05T13:04:03+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,Wipro's non-compete clause: 10 rival firms executives cannot join for 12 months,"Of the 10 top level exits at Wipro in 2023, only two executives including former CFO Jatin Dalal and former SVP Mohd Haque, both of whom joined rival Cognizant, were sued by the IT services major. Here is why: ","In a year when Wipro lost over 10 of its top level executives, along with several others below them, to different companies, only former chief financial (CFO) Jatin Dalal and SVP Mohd Haque, both of whom joined rival Cognizant, ended up getting sued by the IT services giant for breaching non-compete clauses in their employment contracts.  This comes at a time when other key leaders like former chief operating officer (COO) Sanjeev Singh and former iDEAS business head Rajan Kohli also joined rival firms such as CMS IT Services and CitiusTech, respectively, in CEO positions.  So, what gives?  According to Wipro’s lawsuit copy against Dalal, which was accessed by Moneycontrol, the company has a fixed list of 10 major IT companies who are competitors that senior executives cannot join within 12 months of them serving their last day at Wipro.  These firms include Accenture, Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, DXC (formerly HP), HCLTech, IBM, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), and Tech Mahindra.  As a part of the non-compete clause, Dalal had the names of these companies mentioned in his employee contract, Wipro claimed. Joining any of these companies in the stipulated period concerns Wipro, as someone in Dalal’s position would be privy to confidential information in relation to the company’s strategy and business.  Wipro declined to comment on the detailed queries sent to the company.    The lawsuit said, “During the period of employment and for a period of twelve (12) months after his/her last date employment and irrespective of the circumstances of or the reason for such separation, the Optionee acknowledges that he/she shall not accept any offer of employment from a customer or client with whom the Optionee has interacted or worked in a professional capacity representing the Company during the six (6) months preceding the last date of employment or any Competitor of Wipro or the Company.”  “During the period of employment and for a period of twelve (12) months following termination of his/her employment and in the geography for which the Optionee is responsible in the previous 12 months (i) directly or indirectly engage with a Competitor whether such engagement shall be as an employer, officer, director, owner, employee, partner, consultant, advisor or as any other participant, or (ii) assist others in engaging with Competitor in the manner described in the foregoing clause,” it added.  Dalal, during his tenure, was one of the core decision makers and signatories on the company’s acquisitions, strategies, and large deal negotiations of $100 million and above. He was also on the investment committee of the $300-million strategic fund of Wipro Ventures, which invests in early- and mid-staged startups.  His last date of work was on November 30, 2023.  Wipro’s top level exodus &amp;amp; lawsuits  Apart from suing Dalal for breaching non-compete clause, Wipro is also seeking Rs 25.15 crore in damages from him, along with 18 percent interest per annum until the time of full payment. Recently, the Bengaluru City Civil court referred this case to arbitration.  Wipro also sued its former SVP and head of healthcare and medical devices for the Americas, Mohd Haque, who also joined Cognizant recently. Haque is facing accusations of possessing seven files containing confidential information, which were sent from his personal Gmail account and flagged by Wipro’s IT team along with violating his non-compete clause. The company additionally claims that there were more files that got uploaded and sent outside the company to his personal email account.  Not just Wipro, Infosys too wrote to Cognizant in an attempt to deter the company from poaching more senior leadership talent from the former.  Along with Haque and Dalal, in 2023, Wipro also lost Singh, Kohli, Americas 2 CFO Nithin V Jaganmohan, India head Satya Easwaran, Vice President Gurvinder Sahni, Americas 1 CFO Kamini Shah, and head of the manufacturing and hi-tech business unit Ashish Saxena.  Most recently, Wipro’s chief growth officer Stephanie Trautman stepped down as the company is restructuring its growth organisation by integrating the Strategic Pursuits team, formerly under the CGO, into Strategic Market Units.    Business slowdown      These top level changes came at a time when Wipro, the country’s fourth largest IT services firm, is struggling to turnaround its business in a challenging demand environment.  As of Q2, which ended in September 30, Wipro’s revenue declined for the third consecutive quarter, coming in at $2.7 billion. Revenue slid 2.3 percent sequentially, and 2 percent in constant currency terms, falling at the lower end of the company's guidance for the quarter.  In the upcoming quarter the company expects a revenue decline, ranging from -3.5 percent to -1.5 percent.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/inside-wipros-non-compete-clause-10-rival-firms-executives-cannot-join-for-12-months-12003821.html

The reason is deeply embedded in Sanskrit tradition.  Sudha Murty, a staunch believer in the perfection of Sanskrit, explained, &quot;Sanskrit is the perfect language, and for every pronunciation, there is a letter.&quot;  Emphasizing the visual imagery associated with the name Murthy, she clarified that 'THY' doesn't align with the Sanskrit spelling. This condition, she revealed, was a crucial aspect of her marriage agreement – a decision rooted in preserving their cultural origins.  “And Murthy in Sanskrit is, you know, Narayana Murty, Vasudeva Murty, this is a kind of name where you can visualize that. Murthy is a statue. So it cannot be ‘THY’,” she shared.  When asked if her husband, Narayana Murthy, had any objections to this distinctive choice, he said he was “open-minded” and “quite modern” about such matters. He stressed the importance of compromise and respecting each other's beliefs, stating, &quot;We should agree to disagree without being disagreeable.&quot;        View this post on Instagram  A post shared by CNBC-TV18 (@cnbctv18india)     He added: “My belief is I should lead by example. I have tried to lead by example in almost everything that I have done in life. My belief is I should lead by example. So therefore I said if I have to insist on whether T or THY, I thought that is not the right thing.”  Sudha Murty's insistence on 'TY' over 'THY' dates back to her college days when she first encountered the spelling disparity with Narayana Murthy. Even during their marriage, she expressed her reluctance to adopt the conventional 'THY,' citing her belief in the correctness of 'TY.'  In an old interview with The Telegraph, Murty recounted her initial reluctance to embrace 'THY' and her preference for maintaining the independence reflected in 'TY.' Despite her inclination to retain her maiden name, Kulkarni, her father's logic prevailed, leading her to choose 'Murty' over 'Murthy.'  As she said, &quot;It’s not about spellings; it’s about what I believe. If it is legally, ethically right, I feel I should do it.&quot;  The couple also said that both their children, Akshata and Rohan, write “Murty” and not “Murthy.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/sudha-murty-reveals-why-she-spells-her-surname-differently-from-narayana-murthy-watch-12003481.html

Now I don’t believe in this. I think what I was doing those days was wrong. I was wrongly idealistic and in some ways, I think, I was influenced a lot by the environment of those days,” Murthy told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.  A self-confessed Leftist, a 28-year-old Narayana Murthy had fallen in love with Sudha Kulkarni, an engineer who had stormed her way into what was formally Telco, now Tata Motors, becoming the first woman to work on the company’s shop floor.  In 1981, it was Sudha Murty who gave her husband Rs 10,000 as the seed capital to set up Infosys. The money came from her personal emergency fund.  When she asked to formally join Infosys, Narayana Murthy had turned her down, saying family members should not join the company.  “I had this feeling that good corporate governance means not bringing family into it because those days it was only family where all kinds of children used to come and run the company. There used to be violation of all laws,” Murthy, 77, said.  Admitting that his wife was more qualified than all the other founders of Infosys, the software icon said a discussion with a couple of professors of philosophy from two top universities of the world brought him to the realisation that he was wrong about not letting her join the company.  Asked if their son Rohan Murty would ever join Infosys, Murthy’s answer was an emphatic no.  “He is even stricter that I am in these ideas. He will never that. Never,” Murthy said.  Rohan Murty, 40, is a computer scientist-turned-entrepreneur with a PhD from Harvard University and an undergraduate degree from Cornell University. He is the founder of Soroco, a data-based software firm that helps convert data into meaningful information that will help organisations address broken patterns of work across teams.  “First of all, I am just a shareholder in Infosys. I have not been consulted on any issue in Infosys since August 2017. It’s the right thing. He’s (Rohan) doing the way we all did.

Facing criticism for his remarks, Murthy clarified his stance, emphasising the need for hard work in a country where many endure demanding professions, such as farming and factory work.  Murthy, sitting in for the interview with his wife Sudha Murty, faced probing questions about the backlash surrounding his recommendation for a 70-hour work week a few months ago. Since then, he has made his stance clear.  Addressing the criticism, Murthy told CNBC-TV18, &quot;I rationalised it this way. If anybody that has performed much better than me in their own field, not necessarily in my field, I would respect, I would call them, and I would say, where do you think I was wrong in saying this? But I didn't find. A lot of my western friends, a lot of NRIs, a lot of good people in India called me, and without exception, they were all very happy.&quot;  He further justified his stance by highlighting the hard work put in by the less privileged in India, stating, &quot;The issue is that we have to work hard in this country because the poor farmer works very hard. You know, the poor factory worker works very hard. So, therefore, those of us who received education at a huge discount, thanks to the subsidy from the government for all these education, owe it to the less fortunate citizens of India to work extremely hard.&quot;        View this post on Instagram  A post shared by CNBC-TV18 (@cnbctv18india)     Sudha Murty, echoed this sentiment, drawing from her family's medical background, &quot;My father used to work more than 70 hours a week.

Murthy has worked 90 hours a week.&quot;  Murthy provided a personal insight into his own rigorous work routine, recounting, &quot;I used to go six and a half days.

I have not given advice to people without having done it myself.&quot;  Murthy has previously revealed that in his four-decade professional career, he worked 70 hours every week and until 1994, worked for 85-90 hours every week since Infosys functioned six days a week during that time span.  During a podcast with former Infosys CFO TV Mohandas Pai, Murthy had said “My request is that our youngsters must say, ‘This is my country. I’d like to work 70 hours a week'.&quot;.

infosys,2024-01-03T18:44:49+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,Wipro's lawsuit against former CFO Jatin Dalal referred to arbitration by Bengaluru court,"This was in favour of Dalal's plea, who had requested the court to refer the matter to arbitration in a countermove in his application. Wipro is also seeking Rs 25.15 crore in damages from him, along with 18% interest per annum.","Wipro's lawsuit against former chief financial officer (CFO) Jatin Dalal was referred to arbitration by the Bengaluru City Civil Court in a hearing on January 3. The court's decision, thereby, allows the admission of a counter petition moved by Dalal.  Wipro had sued Dalal accusing him of violating non-compete clause in his employment contract by joining rival Cognizant within 12 months from his last date of work. In a countermove, Dalal in his application had requested the court to refer the matter to arbitration.  The lawsuit filed against Dalal also demands Rs 25.15 crore in damages to be paid by him, along with 18 percent interest per annum till the date of payment.  Arbitration is a mechanism to resolve disputes between parties without going to court; wherein a neutral person (an arbitrator) is appointed to adjudicate the dispute, and the judgment will be legally enforceable.  For parties to resolve their dispute through arbitration, they must necessarily have an agreement expressing their intention to arbitrate.  What happens next?  Arbitration is a quicker dispute resolution method usually preferred by large business houses. Once a dispute is referred to arbitration, it comes to court only when a judgment by an arbitrator is challenged or when the parties are unable to agree on who the arbitrator will be.  In Dalal’s case it is anticipated that his terms of employment had an arbitration clause, hence the matter was referred to arbitration.  The lawsuit was filed on November 28, two days before Dalal's last day at Wipro on November 30. Dalal's resignation was announced in September, shortly after Cognizant revealed his appointment as their new chief financial officer, effective December.  This move did not sit well with Wipro. In the lawsuit, Wipro claimed that Dalal, who assumed the CFO role in 2015, had been a core decision-maker and signatory on the company's acquisitions, strategies, and major deals exceeding $100 million. This positioned him with access to various sensitive information regarding how Wipro operates.  The IT services major is thus seeking a permanent injunction to prevent Dalal from sharing any company-sensitive details with Cognizant.  IT companies' non-compete concerns  Wipro has also filed a lawsuit against another former senior executive, Mohd Haque, in a US court for joining Cognizant, allegedly breaching the non-compete clause in his employment contract. Haque served as Wipro's former Senior Vice President (SVP) and Head of Healthcare and Medical Devices for the Americas.

Moneycontrol had earlier exclusively reported on this development.","Tech Mahindra on January 3 announced that it has appointed former Infosys executive vice-president and head of human resources, Richard Lobo, as its chief people officer.  This will be a global role for Lobo, coming as a part of Tech Mahindra’s ongoing leadership restructuring under new CEO Mohit Joshi.  Moneycontrol had earlier exclusively reported on this development on November 10.  “With over 25 years of experience in HR transformation, employee experience, diversity, and inclusion, Richard is set to lead the #HR charter at @Tech_Mahindra. Together, we'll continue to scale people processes, drive sustainable growth, and create an unparalleled working environment based on our people-first principles,” Tech Mahindra said in a post on X.  Lobo is a former colleague of Joshi and an Infosys veteran having worked with the IT services giant for over 22 years. He resigned from Infosys in August, following which he was working as an HR consultant and strategic advisor at embattled edtech unicorn BYJU’s.  Joshi re-shared the post adding, “Welcome aboard, Richard. Your people-first approach to empower organisations in the new world of work and passion for nurturing young leaders will serve as a catalyst in shaping our future. Look forward to taking #TechMahindraOnwardsAndUpwards, together.”  Tech Mahindra has also recently appointed former LTI chief marketing officer (CMO) Peeyush Dubey as its CMO.  Prior to Joshi’s restructuring, Harshvendra Soin was both the CHRO and head of marketing at Tech Mahindra. As this role gets split, Soin will be shifting his base to Australia to lead the consolidated Asia Pacific and Japan business.  Tech Mahindra’s restructuring  Joshi had announced the detailed plan for restructuring during its second quarter earnings conference in October. Joshi said that the company will now have a vertical-wise focus for delivery instead of Tech Mahindra’s previous geography-focused structure. Overall, the new CEO has created six focused business units: Americas Communication, Americas Technology Media, Americas diversified, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APJ (Asia Pacific and Japan), and India.

The clause stipulates that Dalal should not join any other rival company for a period of 12 months from the date of his resignation.  The IT services major had filed a lawsuit against Dalal in relation to this in the Bengaluru civil court on November 28.  Wipro also seeks Dalal to pay damages of Rs 25.15 crore along with 18 percent interest per annum till the date of payment, according to the lawsuit copy sourced by Moneycontrol.  “As per the Agreements, the Defendant is liable to recompense the Plaintiff the total number of RSU granted multiplied by the share price prevailing on the date of the award OR the calculated sum equivalent to the gross remuneration earned by the Defendant during the last 12 (twelve) months of service (as applicable). However, without prejudice and in good faith the Plaintiff has restricted its claim, which is calculated as INR 25,15,52,875/- (Rupees Twenty Five Crores Fifteen Lakhs Fifty Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Seventy-five) along with interest calculated at 18% (eighteen per cent) per annum until the date of payment,” the lawsuit said.  Wipro notified the exchanges of Dalal’s resignation in September, following which he was announced to have joined rival Cognizant as the CFO. His last date of work at Wipro was on November 30.  Dalal, too, has submitted his application as a countermove, seeking the court to refer the matter to arbitration. Both parties have presented their arguments to the court, and the next hearing has been scheduled for January 3.  Dalal is a Wipro veteran with over 21 years with company and has served as the CFO since 2015.  In his new role at Cognizant, he will take over from Jan Siegmund, who plans to retire in early 2024. Dalal will report to the company's CEO Ravi Kumar S.  His responsibilities will include overseeing various financial functions globally, such as financial planning and analysis, accounting and controllership, tax, treasury, internal audit, corporate development, investor relations, and enterprise risk management.  As Wipro’s complaint mentioned, Dalal had signed a declaration in his Cognizant offer letter that implies any legal implication from previous employer will not be Cognizant’s responsibility.  “I hereby represent and warrant to cognizant that: (I) I am entering into this agreement voluntarily and that the performance of my duties and responsibilities hereunder will not violate any agreement between me and any other person, firm, organization, Or other entity, (II) I am not bound by the terms of any agreement with any previous employer or other party to refrain from competing, directly or indirectly, with the business of such previous employer or other party, in any case, that would be violated by my entering into this agreement and/or providing services to Cognizant pursuant to the terms hereof, and (III) I have read, understand and accept the above offer of employment and agree to the terms and condition set forth above,” the declaration seen by Moneycontrol said.  This move by Wipro could jeopardise Dalal’s new role at Cognizant.  Meanwhile, Wipro has seen nearly 10 top level exits in 2023 alone, amidst the company’s CEO Thierry Delaporte struggling to turnaround its business in a challenging demand environment.  Wipro has also filed a complaint against another former senior executive in a US court for joining Cognizant after allegedly breaching non-compete clause in his employment contract.

Mohit Joshi, who was President at Infosys, joined Tech Mahindra; Ravi Kumar S, also president at Infosys, joined Cognizant as CEO; Wipro’s long-time CFO, Jatin Dalal, joined Cognizant as CFO following the departure of the firm’s COO Sanjeev Singh (for CMS), and of several senior vice presidents.  Asked about the significance of these developments, Saurabh Srivastava, former Nasscom Chairman and Co-founder of the Indian Angel Network, in an interview with Moneycontrol, said:   “I'm quite happy with all this because it means we are growing up. This is commonplace in America. High-profile execs move around all the time. If it's happening here, it means we are getting somewhere. We are maturing, growing.”  According to estimates by Fitch Ratings, the IT sector’s revenue growth is expected to slow down to 8-10 percent in the current and next fiscal due to weaker economic conditions in the US and Europe, the two largest markets. However, Nasscom projects that the industry can grow at a rate of 11-14 percent and reach a value of $350 bn by 2026.  “When high-profile people quit, they do it because 10 other jobs are waiting for them. If people don't quit, it's often because there are no jobs,’’ explained Srivastava.  ``So, a CFO, CEO, CXO quitting is a good signal. That means there are other jobs around. It means we have a vibrant ecosystem. It's not that people are always happy with the company they are in. They can have differences, but if there are not enough options, they will not quit,” Srivastava added.  However, there is a caveat, said Srivastava, who has been at the forefront of India’s IT revolution — if a lot of top talent leaves a particular company, then clearly it is a management issue.  “The company has to ask, why are these people leaving?” he added.

","As the Indian IT sector goes through a slowdown, an IT industry veteran says that the outlook for 2024 remains cautious and things will turn for the better in 2025  The year 2023 was a momentous one for the IT sector, as the industry endured several shake-ups from geopolitical tensions, which impacted the main markets for Indian IT services – primarily the US and Western Europe, to companies building their offerings for which the customers are not yet ready.  “We are cautious about 2024. Hopefully, by 2025, we should start looking up. The geopolitical scenario should resolve itself. The second thing on IT services is the entry of AI. Most companies have done the work, they are building that into their offerings but all customers are not yet ready. There is a lot of talk, a lot of buzz. Accenture was very quick off the block with AI but their results were not great,” Saurabh Srivastava, co-founder, Indian Angel Network, a platform for seed and early-stage investing, told Moneycontrol.  The ongoing geopolitical situation is squeezing budgets, he added. “We have seen this before. Generally, I find that Indian IT services companies pick up before their global counterparts because they have more reserves. Most IT companies are very healthy on their balance sheets.”  Layoffs in tech and where are the jobs?  According to reports, the tech sector overall has witnessed huge layoffs, affecting around two lakh people in 2023. Some of the reasons cited for that are economic slowdown and widespread adoption of AI.  Srivastava said that while the IT sector could look at cost management, Indian IT does not resort to massive layoffs and are generally more mindful of cost as compared to their European counterparts.  “When slowdown ends.. they are ready to take the upside. They don’t have to get ready to take advantage of the winds.”  In terms of job creation, Srivastava said that one measure to see among IT services companies is their revenue per employee. “And for a long time, it has become less and less linear. Companies are building tools, platforms, products, there is a lot of re-skilling happening.”  On the debate on whether AI will take away jobs or generate jobs, he said that one needs to take a wider view. “It wasn’t long ago that the government believed that automation would lead to fewer jobs... there were similar fears during the industrial revolution. History will tell you it’s a fear that has never been realised. You will have more jobs but different jobs.”  “The Indian IT industry will keep hiring but how much it hires that rate might go down –as revenue per employee goes up, more efficiency comes in, that will happen. But there is a need for all those people in tech start-ups. Every start-up is tech driven, so they need tech people. In the end, a start-up ecosystem will create more jobs than just one IT major.”  You can watch the full conversation with Saurabh Srivastava here.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/it-sector-slowdown-to-continue-until-2025-says-saurabh-srivastava-co-founder-indian-angel-network-11964491.html

Infosys' accusation follows a similar one by its cross-town rival Wipro, which has sued two of its former executives who recently joined Nasdaq-listed Cognizant.  Infosys-Cognizant lock horns   At least three people familiar with the development told Moneycontrol that Infosys had sent a written communication to Cognizant after a few of its senior leaders departed to join the firm.  &quot;Non-compete clauses are not enforceable but this communication to Cognizant was more of a deterrent&quot;, one of the sources cited above said.  A second source said it was sent some weeks ago.  Since he took charge in January this year, Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar, an Infosys veteran himself, has hired over twenty executive vice presidents and four senior vice presidents, many of whom are from Wipro and Infosys.  Wipro has now filed suits in the US and India against two of its former executives- Mohd Haque and Jatin Dalal- who joined Cognizant recently.  The notable Cognizant hires from Infosys include Anurag Vardhan Sinha, Nageswar Cherukupalli, Narsimha Rao Mannepalli and Shweta Arora.  While the first two have already joined Cognizant, the latter two were tipped to join as head of delivery and head of consulting. But Infosys' move to send a missive may have delayed those plans, according to one of the sources cited above.  While Mannepalli left Infosys in June, Arora left in October. Their LinkedIn profiles haven't been updated to reflect the new organisational roles.  Infosys and Cognizant did not respond to queries at the time of publishing.  Weak business environment  The standoff with Cognizant comes at a time when both Infosys and Wipro are battling a tough business environment coupled with senior management attrition.

Infosys deal recall shows headwinds not over for tech space,"The major concern for the industry has been reduction in discretionary spend by organizations across the world. IT spend for many companies comes under discretionary spend. For instance, in case of Infosys deal cancellation, it is not necessary for a company to start their AI journey now and can be postponed.","Tech giant Infosys on December 26 said one of its prospective clients has cancelled the deal focused on artificial intelligence solutions. It was a 15-year deal signed in September 2023. The deal termination comes at a time when IT companies around the world grapple with uncertainties and headwinds.  The cancellation, though too early to be tagged the beginning of a trend, points at the fact that the IT sector is still in the troubled waters despite the western economies arguably wading through the crisis, stoking the possibility of a recession.  Analysts and fund managers have also been hopeful about AI bringing dual benefits for the IT sector – more deals and less cost as AI can replace engineers. This cancellation of the deal is more likely a one-off setback, they believe.  “It is one-off thing,” said Krathi Bathini, director for equity strategy at WealthMills Securities. “We don’t have much information regarding the reason behind deal cancellation but it will be interesting to see how the Infosys management responds to this in the earnings commentary next month.”  Bathini pointed out that this instance does affirm that problems for IT companies are not over.  Though, if we go by the management commentary, IT companies have been prepared for such a situation. “Delays in decision-making continues,” accepted Nilanjan Roy, then CFO of Infosys in the Q2 earnings call. He had said that clients were taking a conservative approach in signing deals in several verticals, including financial services, communication, energy, utilities, resources and services.  The major concern for the industry has been reduction in discretionary spend by organisations across the world. IT spend for many companies comes under the discretionary head. For instance, in case of the Infosys deal cancellation, it is not necessary for a company to start their AI journey now and can be postponed.  Everyone believes that such a scenario is likely more short term than one that is likely to persist. “You know that, like everybody in our industry, we have a certain volume of our business that is more discretionary,” said Thierry Delaporte, CEO of Wipro in his last earnings call. “We might be a little more exposed than some others because of our significant presence in the consulting business in particular. And even if we know that it will be the first one to bounce back when the demand is there.”  Amid all this, large deal wins which are usually multi-year contracts have been on a rise. All top IT companies believe the momentum will continue on this front. However, one worry has been low revenue growth despite large deals flowing in rapidly.  Companies believe there is a specific reason behind a stagnation in revenue growth.  “The newly won deals are converting into revenue as expected, but these revenue inflows are getting neutralised by reduction in the existing revenue base as the transformation projects get completed... Or, in some cases, downsized. This has led to muted revenue growth,” said K Krithivasan, chief executive officer and managing director at TCS in his last earnings call.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fear-comes-to-the-fore-infosys-deal-recall-shows-headwinds-not-over-for-tech-space-11960541.html

The Nifty 50 snapped seven-week winning streak, but did not fall below the previous week's low and continued higher highs, higher lows for the fourth consecutive week.  The market seems to have entered into a consolidation mode with hurdle on the higher side at 21,593, the record high, and the support for the Nifty 50 on the lower side at the 21,200-21,000 levels. If the index sees a breakout, then 21,600-21,800 can be the levels to watch out for, whereas breaking of 21,000 can drag the index towards the 20,800 levels, experts said.  &quot;Notably, the bounce from lower levels indicate a strong support around the 21,000 - 20,950 zone, which is technically significant with a bullish gap on the daily chart. Going ahead, this zone may act as an immediate base, and only a break below it could trigger a market correction,&quot; Sameet Chavan, who is the research head for technicals and derivatives at Angel One, said.  On the positive side, he feels the Nifty tested the 200 percent reciprocal retracement of the October fall around 21,600, which is considered a pattern target.  Despite a positive undertone, the market appears to be in a corridor of uncertainty, and trading within the mentioned broad range is expected in the truncated week ahead of the new year, he said, adding traders are cautioned to monitor these levels and adjust their trading strategies accordingly.  Om Mehra, technical analyst at SAMCO Securities, also advised caution as certain sectors appear to be in the overbought territory potentially setting the stage for profit-booking. This could notably impact mid and small-cap equities, he feels.  Technically, Mehra feels, the Nifty exhibited resilience by holding onto the crucial 21,000 mark following a sharp one-day decline and this level is now perceived as a strong support. On the higher side, if it breaks 21,600, the Nifty might attempt to test new highs around the 21,750-21,800 zone.

","Infosys on December 23 announced that the undisclosed global company, which had previously signed a $1.5 billion deal focused on artificial intelligence solutions, has now decided to terminate the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the IT services giant.  This was intended to be a 15-year deal, inked in September 2023, signaling increasing uncertainty in the demand and technology budgets of IT services customers.

No further reason was given for the termination and neither was the name of the global company disclosed.

While that maybe in distant future, the near-term outlook for Indian IT companies remains weak.  Foreign banking giant Citi has reiterated its “sell” or “neutral” calls on all the IT stocks that are part of the Nifty50 pack, as they go through a seasonally weak quarter and due to low visibility of large projects.  Other than Infosys and HCL Tech, which have a “neutral” call, Citi has a “sell” rating for all other Nifty IT stocks  At 9:30 am, Nifty IT was trading at 35,749, down 0.09 percent from the previous close.  On TCS  Citi has a target of Rs 3,170 a share, while the current market price is Rs 3,860.  Despite continuous substantial deal wins —exceeding $10 billion in the last three quarters — existing business clients are reevaluating spending, potentially neutralising the benefits of these deals, Citi said after interacting with the company's management.  The company is experiencing normal seasonality in the third quarter, with furloughs aligning with historical patterns.  Furlough is a temporary pause in work where employees retain their job but are not paid for a specified period. Furloughs have been high because of weak demand environment — there are not enough projects for employees to work on, so they are “benched”.  The third quarter is seasonally weak because of fewer working days due to the holiday season in the West.  Also Read: IT, pharma likely to be biggest beneficiaries of FII inflows. Here's why  On Infosys  Citi's target price for Infosys is Rs 1,565 a share, while the current market price is Rs 1,567. “Clients are looking to optimise costs, which is visible in the mega deals that are announced. Telecom, hi-tech, retail and financial Services including capital markets, investment banking and cards, are some of the challenged verticals,&quot; analysts at Citi said.  On Wipro  Citi has a target of Rs 360 a share, while Wipro’s current market price is Rs 446. Insights gleaned from a CFO meeting suggest that there's been no significant alteration in the visibility for December quarter compared to the start of the quarter, Citi said.  Furloughs are intensifying notably in the BFSI and tech sectors. Discretionary spends are being curtailed and the expected replenishment of large transformational projects is not materialising.  &quot;Additionally, the company doesn't plan campus hiring for the upcoming year unless the demand environment undergoes substantial changes,&quot; Citi said.  On Tech Mahindra  Citi's target for Tech Mahindra Rs 1,000, while current market price is Rs 1,305. Insights from the CFO meeting indicate a strategic focus on six regions, including the US, Europe, Asia (excluding India), and India itself, Citi analysts said.  &quot;Emphasis is placed on top accounts, with plans for dedicated delivery for the top 30 accounts and a structured approach for the subsequent 50 accounts. Further hiring, particularly the Chief People Officer, is expected by January 2024,&quot; the bank said in its recent report.  Also Read: Odd ones out: Only 2 Nifty indices haven't touched lifetime highs this year  On HCL Tech  Citi's target is Rs 1,295 a share against the current market price of Rs 1,483.

Here's why","In Wipro, TCS, LTIMindtree and Infosys, FII stakes are 2-3 percentage points below the peak holding during rate hike cycle. For Tech Mahindra, the difference is as wide as 9 percentage points. With rate cycle turning, the view is big deal wins will soon resume from large clients","With the US Federal Reserve indicating three rate cuts for the next calendar year, the consensus view on Dalal Street is that foreign investors will be back with a bang. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have so far bought Rs 29,700 crore worth of equities in December, after having sold about Rs 75,000 crore worth of equities in the past three months.  Analysts and fund managers believe that the land is fertile for strong FII inflows on the back of dollar easing, bond yields cooling off and rate cuts on the horizon. Furthermore, political uncertainty in the country has faded after BJP's three-state election win and the latest data showing robust growth for the domestic economy.  As FIIs flock to India, all eyes are on large-caps, especially Nifty 50 stocks, where liquidity will not be a problem for the big money. According to a Moneycontrol analysis, IT, pharma and certain banks stand to benefit from the gush of flows as they have taken the highest dent in FII stake since the rate hike cycle began in 2022.    In Wipro, TCS, LTIMindtree and Infosys, FII stakes are 2-3 percentage points below the peak holding during the rate hike cycle. For Tech Mahindra, the difference is as wide as 9 percentage points. With the rate cycle turning, the view is big deal wins will soon resume from large clients.  Aishvarya Dadheech, Founder of Fident Asset Management, said, &quot;Largecap IT stocks' valuations are very reasonable at the moment. The growth outlook is a little bleak but that should reverse in the next 2-3 quarters. When that happens, IT stocks will have EPS (earnings per share) tailwinds behind them, too.&quot;  Over the past two days, since Fed sounded dovish, large-cap IT stocks have gained 5-7 percent.  Also Read: MC Pro Inside Edge: Local funds cry foul in bank QIP, wealth god in action at Zee, old wine in new bottle  The other sector that is likely to be a beneficiary is pharma. Stocks like Cipla, Divi's Laboratories have seen FII stakes fall 3-5 percentage points during the rate hike cycle. On the other hand, Sun Pharma and Dr Reddy's have seen their FII stake increase over the same period.  &quot;Pharma, healthcare stocks are anyway considered defensive stocks. The sector's revenues are now normalising after the COVID-19 bump up.  Furthermore, generic pricing decline now is not as steep as last 5 years so profitability from the existing portfolio will go up,&quot; said Rajesh Pherwani, founder of Valcreate Investment Managers.  &quot;The sweet spot is stocks that have US as well as India presence, have new products in the pipeline and are not running into problems with US FDA often,&quot; Pherwani added.

Apart from that, a technical reason behind the inflows is that banks have the biggest weightage on Nifty 50,&quot; he said.  Going by the numbers, it seems like the trend has already begun.

The government has appointed Ernst &amp;amp; Young (E&amp;amp;Y) as its consultant for formulation of the Request for Proposal (RFP) to invite bids for the next IT consultancy for GST. The contract with Infosys for providing technology support for GST comes to an end from September 30, 2024.  “We have started work on the request for proposal. Target is that by March we should be able to come out with it. Till now it has been a managed service provider model with Infosys, wherein the company is handling both hardware and software requirements. Now we are contemplating either to stick to the same or separate out software and hardware providers to reduce dependence on a single company,” the official told Moneycontrol.

In 2020, the government raised the issue with Infosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani to fix the glitches. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had asked Infosys to boost GSTN capacities to handle the heavy traffic on the GST portal. The government had to even extend the deadline for filing GST returns to resolve the technical bug around issues including login errors, auto logouts and delays in receiving on-time passwords (OTPs).  &quot;The flip side of having two consultants is that both vendors may have issues and blame each other for any shortcomings.

Since there will be no restrictions on global companies bidding for the contract, the government is hoping there may be some interested multi-national corporations (MNCs). “Since the basic complications during the initial years of GST are over, there will be only some additions and deletions in the system,” the official said. E-invoicing technology support will be the focus for the government going ahead.  If needed, the government is also open to extending the Infosys contract by another six months, he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/excl-govt-mulling-separate-bids-for-gst-hardware-software-support-in-march-11909091.html

One of the now-deleted videos on Facebook had a morphed version of the software leader purportedly saying he and billionaire Elon Musk are working on a project called “Quantum AI”.

The altered clip urges people to join “Quantum AI”, claiming they can earn up to “$3,000 on their first working day”.  The first giveaway that the clip is fake is that Murthy’s lip movements in the video are out of sync with the audio.  The original footage is of Murthy speaking at the Moneycontrol Startup Conclave held on July 7 in Bengaluru. He was interviewed by his son Rohan Murty. During the candid conversation on a range of topics, nowhere did Murthy mention anything on artificial intelligence.  A second deepfake video, posted on Facebook on November 8, has a morphed voice of Narayana Murthy speaking about “Quantum AI”.

The investment pace will be slower than North America, which is expected to invest $6 billion by 2024","European companies are doubling down on their generative AI investments next year, growing by 115 percent and expected to $2.8 billion, according to a report by IT services giant Infosys. However, it added that these companies are still struggling to generate value from the hyped technology and are moving more cautiously than North American companies.  The pace of investment in generative AI in Europe is slower than in North America where spend is expected to reach close to $6 billion. Among European countries, France and Germany are expected to lead spending and adoption with nearly $730 million in France and almost $610 million getting invested in Germany, in the next 12 months, the report said.  “In both countries, about 50 percent of companies have either implemented GenAI or have implemented and have created business value from it – compared with roughly 40 percent in UK, Benelux, and Nordics. The UK is expected to move past Benelux into third place in the next 12 months, more than doubling spending to nearly $510 million,” the report said.  In terms of rate of growth, Nordic companies are expected the highest jump with more than 2.5X their current spending at over $470 million in the next 12 months.  Cautious moves  Though these companies are deploying and experimenting with GenAI, very few are seeing actual value creation so far.  “Only 6 percent of European companies generate business value with their GenAI use cases. France, Germany and the UK lead the region, with about 10 percent of companies reporting value delivered by their GenAI projects,” the report quoted.  This cautiousness is also driven by concerns around ethics and bias driven by the more regulated European market. However, European companies remain optimistic about the impact expected on their business and are in their ability to train and recruit talent, as well as manage and control generative AI systems.  Balakrishna D R (Bali), Executive Vice-President, Global Head of AI and Industry Verticals, Infosys, said “Generative AI is driving phenomenal transformation across industries, and investment is happening at a rapid pace. Against the backdrop of an ever-evolving regulatory landscape, organizations must embed responsible AI techniques to not only improve data quality and management but effectively manage ethics and bias risks.”  “Our research has shown that for European businesses to derive business value, they must develop and evolve an AI-first operating model that prioritizes business transformation and skills development, and enables them to maximize human potential,” he added.  On the business front, Infosys had over 50 active generative AI projects in the pipeline.  It announced three large deals in Q2: a $2-billion contract with an existing customer to provide AI and automation-led development and maintenance services over five years; a $1.5-billion deal with Liberty Global over five years; and an MoU that was signed for $1.5 billion with an undisclosed global company, where the spend is over 15 years.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/european-firms-to-increase-generative-ai-investments-by-115-in-2024-infosys-report-11859601.html

What government said,"NR Narayana Murthy had said that India’s work productivity is among the lowest in the world and to compete with countries like China, India’s youngsters must put in extra hours of work.","The government is reportedly not considering the 70-hour work week call by Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy, a proposal that saw fierce debates on the internet. “No such proposal is under consideration of Government of India,” Rameswar Teli, the minister of state (MoS) for labour and employment, said on Monday, according to a Hindustan Times report.  Teli was replying to a question by three Lok Sabha MPs during the ongoing winter session of parliament. Congress MP Komati Venkata Reddy, Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader Manne Srinivas Reddy and YSR Congress Party MP Kanumuru Raghu Rama Krishna Raju asked the Ministry of Labour and Employment if the government is evaluating the 70-hour work week proposal made by Narayana Murthy, Hindustan Times reported.  Murthy, 77, had advised youngsters in India to work for 70 hours a week to increase India's overall productivity.  In conversation with former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai on a podcast in October, Murthy said that India’s work productivity is among the lowest in the world and to compete with countries like China, India’s youngsters must put in extra hours of work – as Japan and Germany did after World War 2.  “So therefore, my request is that our youngsters must say, ‘This is my country. I’d like to work 70 hours a week',&quot; he had said.  The software icon appeared on the first episode of 3one4 Capital’s podcast ‘The Record’, which was released on YouTube.  While a section of the internet, including Ola boss Bhavish Aggarwal agreed with Murthy's point, it did not go down well with a large number of social media users who pointed out that working for extra hours consistently could in fact lead to a drop in productivity among the youth.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/narayana-murthy-70-hour-work-week-call-raised-in-parliament-what-government-said-11855821.html

The senior executive informed the police that one of the scammers called him on November 21 and told him there was a case filed against his name at a police station in Mumbai and a money laundering case filed against his Aadhar card details. In the next 48 hours, the scammers forced him to send Rs 3.7 crore to various bank accounts.  Police officials said that the caller claimed to be a TRAI official and said that a SIM card registered in the complainant's name was used to post illegal ads. When the complainant told the scammer that the phone number did not belong to him, he was told the number was found using his Aadhar card credentials.  The call was later transferred to a person who claimed to be a senior officer in the Mumbai police and told the techie he would need to come and visit them and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in Mumbai and Delhi and threatened to arrest him if he failed to turn up.  The techie was then asked to attend a video call in which he saw a police station with a few men in uniform who showed him their ID cards and a copy of the complaint against him, all of which were fake.  The techie was later asked to send the money to avoid getting arrested and was told that he would get the money back after an audit on his bank account in the money laundering case.  The techie sent the amount between November 21-23, but later realised that he had been scammed and filed a police complaint on November 25.

On November 30, the IT services firm announced its collaboration with energy giant Shell to accelerate the adoption of immersion cooling services for data centres. &quot;Through this strategic engagement, Infosys and Shell will bring together their capabilities, and an eco-system of partners, to create an integrated offering for green data centres,&quot; the company said in an exchange filing.  Follow our market blog for all the live action  Infosys has said this will be achieved by leveraging Shell's immersion cooling fluid designed to increase the energy efficiency and performance of data servers and IT components.  The pact gains significance as data centres are responsible for up to 1.5 percent of global electricity consumption and a percent of global CO2 emissions.  The company also added that artificial intelligence is expected to accelerate data centre demand and AI workloads would significantly increase both energy consumption and CO2 emission. Immersion cooling technology claims to potentially lower CO2 emissions by up to 30 percent and 48 percent reduction in energy footprint production.  &quot;It is also critical that future digital and physical solutions are created with a view to making AI more sustainable and scalable,&quot; the management said.

Among IT services companies, Accenture and Wipro make it to the top 25 ","India’s IT and IT-BPM services sector is investing big in employee training and skilling, with an annual average investment of about Rs 1.97 crore a company across sizes. Around 68 percent of the companies also said they were closely involved in the development of employees across levels, India’s Best Workplaces in IT &amp;amp; IT-BPM 2023 report released on November 30 said.  The findings come at a time when the IT sector is investing heavily in skilling employees in artificial intelligence (AI), generative AI and cloud computing skills. Companies have started sharing quarterly updates on employees whose training has been completed, targets of workforces to be trained by the end of the financial year and more.  Accenture and Wipro were among the top 25 in India’s Best Workplaces in IT &amp;amp; IT-BPM 2023 listing. The list is split — 1-25 and then 26-50, with names of the firms arranged in alphabetic order — A-Z —  on both occasions.  The companies were picked based on how they prioritised work culture, which has become important to improve productivity and employee retention, as they continue to go slow on hiring amid a challenging demand environment.  Recently, some IT companies laid off employees or cut salaries to trim expenses, which led to a decline in employee morale and satisfaction, the report said.  Other companies in the Top 25 include VOIS, Akamai Technologies, Atlassian, Blue Yonder, Cadence Design Systems, CGI Information Systems and Management, Consultants, Cisco Systems, Encora Innovation Labs and H &amp;amp; R Block.  Infosys and Happiest Minds, too, featured in the list but in the &quot;top 26- 50&quot; rankings.    The report also highlights several aspects of employee well-being, a prominent theme in the 2023 report was burnout. According to the survey, the burnout risk continues to remain a concern, affecting 27 percent of employees in large companies, 3 percent higher than their mid-sized counterparts.  “Female senior managers in particular experience a 5 percent higher burnout rate than male counterparts. The trend draws the importance of maintaining a delicate balance between growth and employee well-being,” the report said.  Yeshasvini Ramaswamy, CEO, Great Place To Work India, said “India's IT industry contributes a staggering 7.5 percent towards the country's gross domestic product (GDP). This statistic not only underscores the economic significance of this sector but also showcases the pivotal role each organization plays in shaping the trajectory of our nation.&quot;  The emergence and robust contribution of cutting-edge technologies such as AI and deep tech in the Indian IT sector, as of 2023, further accentuated the industry's status as a hub of talent and innovation with global delivery capabilities, Ramaswamy said.  “Our report, India's Best Workplaces in IT &amp;amp; IT-BPM, highlights the vibrancy and resilience of this industry. With over 1.8 million employee voices contributing to our study, trends that will shape our future of work continue to be myriad,” she added.

A per capita GDP (gross domestic product) of $2,300 puts us at about twice the per capita GDP of what is called low-income countries by the United Nations and other bodies. We are still far away from being called a middle-income country, where the per capita GDP is somewhere between $6,000 to about $12,000-$15,000&quot; he said.  Elaborating on this matter, Murthy said &quot;The other day, the prime minister said that his government will provide free ration to 800 million people for the next five years. So this means that we have at least 800 million people who do not have the capacity to earn two meals a day&quot;  Therefore, to create an &quot;efficient, corruption-free and effective&quot; public goods in our country, the taxation will have to be higher than what people see in developed countries, he said.  &quot;I personally would not at all (hold a) grudge if I have to pay a higher level of taxation. It's only people like Priyank (Kharge, the state IT minister), who will have to say how can we provide the best services for the poor people&quot; Murthy said.

When the government provides these services and subsidies to citizens, there should also be a contribution of the citizens towards making our society a better one, he said.  For example, Murthy suggested that if the government plans to provide free electricity to citizens, it should also state that this benefit would only be made available if the percentage attendance in schools go up by 20 percent.  &quot;Therefore, while I am not against free services being provided ... I think we should expect something in return from those people who receive those free subsidies to take a slightly bigger responsibility towards making their own future generation including their own children and grandchildren better in terms of going to school etc&quot; he said  Read: India must spend $1 billion annually for 20 years to train teachers: Narayana Murthy at Infosys Prize  During his fireside chat, the Infosys founder also mentioned that the people in the infrastructure industry must work three shifts to improve the city's infrastructure with a sense of alacrity. &quot;For example, completing the Electronic City Metro and expanding to other areas where there are a lot of companies, have to be taken up on a priority&quot; he said.  He added that in the nations that have high aspirations, people have worked atleast two shifts.  &quot;If we did that, I have no doubt on why India cannot grow even faster than China, not just the growth alone ... we will catch up with China and hopefully one day we can overtake.

Murthy was speaking at the Bengaluru Tech Summit 2023.  Murthy’s words come at a time when tech companies are staring at a possible disruption or threat to their businesses with generative AI technologies like ChatGPT gaining prominence, though he remains unperturbed about it.  Speaking to Nikhil Kamath, co-founder at Zerodha, Murthy said, “The reality is that the human mind is the most flexible and the most powerful instrument that ever existed. We have started invention of the wheel to ChatGPT 4 today. It has been a journey of asking questions as to how we can use tech to make our lives better, more productive and how can we reduce the cost of tech and how can we make tech all-pervasive and how can we use tech to better transparency and efficiency.  “All of that has happened due to invention that happens once in a while or through innovation that happens continuously. So the only insurance that companies like Infosys have for their survival and ability to succeed, is the ability to create a mindset in the organisation that constantly innovates on improving productivity and more. As long as the CEOs of companies encourage such thinking among employees of the company then you don’t have to worry about ChatGPT or LLM or anything that comes,” he added.

While it is way off its highs, Yes Bank's share price has gained nearly 18 percent in the past year.   In a bid to transition to clean energy, Tata Power has been an attractive proposition for shareholders looking to benefit from the country’s move away from non-renewable energy. In a recent note, rating agency Crisil revised its outlook on the company from &quot;stable&quot; to &quot;positive&quot;. This comes on the back of a notable uptick in operating profitability and a strong financial performance.   The company lays emphasis on maximising shareholder value. While the quality of business metrics and financial profile may vary from one Tata group company to another, investors have been unanimously confident of the group's quality of governance, and core value system.   The country’s leading EV manufacturer counts the late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala as a major investor. The company has been a darling of investors this year, gaining the most among all major automobile stocks. Its strides in the EV and SUV space make it a good bet among retail investors.   The Mukesh Ambani-led company has several key factors that make the stock an irresistible inclusion in one’s portfolio. While its main business entails oil and gas exploration, it is certainly a big competitor in the other industries too. Telecommunications, fashion, electronics, textiles, and media are spaces where the Mumbai-headquartered company has consolidated its position. Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group. Network18 is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary.   The cigarette and FMCG major has performed well on the bourses, gaining nearly 80 percent since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. At a time when uncertainty looms over the industry largely due to high inflation and continued weak rural sales, ITC's recovery in Cigarette volumes offers decent earnings visibility at reasonable valuations, analysts say.   With the biggest IPO ever, analysts believe the insurance major has levers in place to maintain the industry-leading position and ramp up growth in the highly profitable product segments, mainly protection, and savings annuity.   Despite mounting losses and the overall turmoil around the telecom major, investors don’t want to let go of the stock. Priced at about Rs 14, its affordability makes it a buy.   There’s no surprise when it comes to banking, and to the biggest private lender in the company. It is estimated that there is high growth potential in the lender on account of good capital position, revenue and cost synergies arising out of the HDFC merger, which will aid growth and profitability.   Given its stature as the largest public sector lender, the stock seems to be a safe investment. Analysts say the bank is well-capitalised to handle any additional risk on its portfolio due to uncertainty. SBI's asset quality has also steadily improved over the years.   The IT sector has been one of the worst-hit in recent months as people returned to offices and students to classrooms, putting a stop to COVID-led gains. Rising interest rates are a worry and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been another dampener. This is because recessionary fears and a possible economic crisis have forced companies to lower tech spending. The company boasts of a large retail investor base and remains among a few IT companies on analysts' favoured list.   In a span of six months, the share price has gained 323 percent following the company’s increased push towards sustainable energy and the government's emphasis on renewable sources. Since the start of 2023, the company has won multiple projects. These factors together make it an attractive buy for investors.   The IT major, like other companies in the sector, has been on the receiving end of the post-COVID slowdown and the Russian-Ukraine war. Deal wins coupled with the resilience observed in the first half of FY24 are expected to provide support, and mitigate the potential downside impact on the full-year FY24 figures.   The Tata group is one of India's oldest conglomerates and arguably among the very few to have consistently retained shareholder confidence across businesses. Much of this confidence is attributed to the company's prudent cash flow management, efficient capital allocation strategies, healthy business partnerships and the ability to execute strategic manoeuvres.   The railway company has been on the up ever since regular travel resumed after the pandemic. Extensive connectivity plans by the government have also added to the momentum, leading investors to buy the stock.

Technical chart of Infosys showing pennant breakout | Source: SBI Securities  &quot;The stock reached a high of 1453 on November 16 and then saw a minor pullback, forming a bullish pennant pattern. During the pennant pattern formation, volume activity stayed below the 50-day average. The pennant is a short-term trend continuation pattern with conical bodies formed during a consolidation period,&quot; Shah said.  On Wednesday, the stock broke out of the pennant pattern, indicating further bullish momentum. A significant bullish candle formed on the breakout day, reinforcing the strength of the breakout. The stock is trading above its short and long-term moving averages, both on a rising trajectory.  Discussing indicators, Shah noted that the 14-period daily RSI surged above the 60-mark for the first time since October 2023. The stochastic oscillator also suggests a bullish momentum as the fast stochastic is trading above its slow stochastic line.  On the derivatives front, the November future surged 1.28 percent, and the cumulative open interest (OI) of the current, next, and far series increased by nearly 5 percent, indicating a clear long build-up.  Advice for traders  With all these factors favouring the bulls, Shah advises traders to accumulate the stock in the 1,460-1,450 range with a stop-loss at Rs 1,420.

infosys,2023-11-20T13:10:07+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,Sam Altman’s ouster unlikely to impact OpenAI’s partnerships with IT companies: Experts,"IT services companies already have billions of dollars at stake, earmarked to be invested in strengthening their AI capabilities and training workforces over the next couple of years.    ","The ouster of Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO and the face of the AI boom, is unlikely to have a long-term impact on the company’s existing business partnerships with Indian IT services companies and the pace of generative AI innovations, said industry experts.  Over the past year, even as demand continued to slow down in a tough business environment, IT companies banked on customers’ generative AI curiosity to win deals, leading to billions of dollars being invested to develop industry-specific use cases of the technology and upskilling employees.  Altman’s abrupt firing on November 17, shook the technology world as it comes at a time when competition from big tech rivals Google, IBM and NVIDIA is intensifying.  In the short run, said Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of management consulting firm Everest Group, Altman’s exit is unlikely to affect OpenAI’s partnerships and commercial agreements. But in the long run, it may affect the company’s ability to raise capital, which could make it a less attractive partner, he told Moneycontrol.  OpenAI, which started as a ‘non-profit’ organisation, later transitioned to a hybrid ‘capped-profit’ company, letting it raise funds externally, while ensuring that the original non-profit operation would still benefit. It has so far raised $10 billion from Microsoft at a valuation of almost $30 billion, as it invests in building computing capacity.  This structure, however, led to a lot of confusion reports suggest. OpenAI is structured in a way that the non-profit owns and controls a subsidiary that received funds from Microsoft, causing Altman to not have a say in the AI unicorn’s boardroom workings.  According to the company’s charter, its principal beneficiary is “humanity”, not investors.  Phil Fersht, CEO, HFS Research, a global business research consultancy, expects confusion and some chaos in the short term. The whole episode, he said, smells like a “coup d'état, with Altman becoming too powerful and not pandering to the OpenAI board”.  “However, the AI revolution has so much momentum, with many enterprise clients seeking so much support and advice from leading services firms when it comes to AI, that services firms will work even harder with Altman’s successor to ensure continuity and progressive value as these technologies evolve and mature,” he told Moneycontrol.  IT services companies such as Accenture, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra have in recent times been in overdrive to build their AI capabilities and offerings.  Billions at stake  While not pertaining to OpenAI’s ChatGPT alone, generative AI’s current boom has seen billions being invested by IT companies to develop the tech with ChatGPT and other partners like Google. IT companies have already charted their next few years of business growth around AI’s rapid evolution.  As of Q2FY24, TCS already has more than 250 generative AI opportunities in the pipeline and it has completed training over 100,000 employees in this field.  Infosys had over 50 active generative AI projects in the pipeline. In fact, it announced three large deals in Q2: a $2-billion contract with an existing customer to provide AI and automation-led development and maintenance services over five years; a $1.5-billion deal with Liberty Global over five years; and an MoU that was signed for $1.5 billion, where the spend is over 15 years.  HCLTech, too, had earlier said that it has over 140 external and internal generative AI projects at various stages of maturity—from PoCs to implementation. The company will be training around 20,000 associates in generative AI skills and has set up three global labs.  Meanwhile, Wipro is investing $1 billion to strengthen its AI capabilities over the next three years. It will train 250,000 associates in required skills. Accenture is investing $3 billion to enhance data and AI capabilities in the next three years.  Internally, too, these companies have started seeing an increase of up to 30 percent in productivity by using generative AI for coding and several other functions.  But now, as OpenAI’s future remains uncertain, it’s going to be up to the partners or the IT services companies to “determine the level of risk / reward they want to be in with OpenAI or go with Sam’s new company,” said Ray Wang, CEO of Constellation Research, a technology advisory firm.  Queries sent to TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Capgemini and LTIMindtree didn’t elicit any responses at the time of publishing. Any comments from the companies will be updated in this article later.  Beyond OpenAI  Also, analysts unanimously believed that while ChatGPT got the ball rolling for generative AI in November 2022, giving investor Microsoft a head start, the quick catchup by Google and other rivals have made the technology and its future prospects too big to fail or to be controlled by one company.  As Bendor-Samuel put it, “The cat is out of the bag, and the Gen AI race is on, without regard to what happens at open AI. There is so much investment in this area that even if Open AI stumbles the overall pace of innovation will continue unabated.”  Fersht added, “If OpenAI derails as a result of this, it will hinder innovation in the short term, but nothing is slowing the pace of innovation in AI, and we’ll see other entities emerging at the forefront of this rapidly evolving industry,” he added.  Security and governance concerns  Moreover, the biggest takeaway for enterprise customers right now from Altman’s exit will be to focus on improving and fixing security and governance loopholes amidst fast-paced innovation. This was one of the primary concerns of OpenAI’s board amid Altman’s aggressive push on releasing new features and innovations, as security may have taken a backseat.  “The balance between too much governance and not enough innovation was the challenge the board faced,” said Wang. “The big worries were ownership of training data, impact of untested models, unwanted bias detection. Google has been the most careful and the most innovative. Microsoft has been very careful and the most adaptive. OpenAI was the least careful and the fastest innovator.”  Sanchit Vir Gogia, founder and CEO of market intelligence firm Greyhound Research concurred, adding that the company had faced flak for issues around ethical use of data to train the model and, more importantly, the intellectual property and compliance issues that customers can face.  &quot;This is because Microsoft, as a key investor, is already significantly using the technology in their products, and this commercialisation is not the agenda with which the company was founded,” he told Moneycontrol.  Fersht added that concerns surrounding trust, security and compliance are massive for enterprises when it comes to AI and are only just starting to exacerbate.  Manish Maheshwari, former Twitter India head and co-founder of Fanory.ai, a platform that leverages AI for creators, believes OpenAI's recent move to part ways with Altman signals a significant shift towards prioritising ethical AI development over immediate commercial benefits.  “At the heart of Silicon Valley's evolving ethos is a deep-seated tension between commercial success and ethical technology development…This decision, while bold, has left many in the tech industry both surprised and contemplative about the future direction of AI,&quot; he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sam-altmans-ouster-unlikely-to-impact-openais-partnerships-with-it-companies-experts-11771841.html

The IT services major will be giving out 80 percent payout, coming at a time when the company has slashed the upper end of its revenue guidance and decided to skip going to college campuses for hiring, a reflection of tough business environment.  Employees who fall below the manager category and above entry levels will be eligible for this range of payout. Individual pay outs will differ based on performance and contribution for the quarter, The Economic Times reported. The performance bonus budget will be shared with the unit delivery managers who will then distribute the amount the respective units this week.  Moneycontrol could not independently verify the ET report.  Meanwhile, Infosys’ headcount has continued to decline in the second quarter by 7,530 and freshers who received offer letters are still awaiting on boarding. This was the steepest fall in quarterly headcount for the company in a quarter.  Skipping campus hiring  During the company’s Q2 earnings conference, CFO Nilanjan Roy said that the company evaluates hiring plans each quarter and doesn’t plan to go to campuses to hire yet.  Infosys also slashed its guidance sharply at the end of Q1, lowering the upper end of its guidance expecting revenue growth to come at 1-2.5 percent for full year of FY24. Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh told analysts that there are delays in the starting of large programs, and there are the deal closures were also taking longer.  “We are seeing discretionary spend which is coming down and we saw that continuing on transformation programmes being slow, that is also continuing on in this quarter,” he had said. This factored in that Q3 and Q4 are seasonally weak quarters for the sectors.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/infosys-to-roll-out-80-average-variable-pay-for-q2-report-11762861.html
infosys,2023-11-16T10:28:39+05:30,Chandra R Srikanth,"AI will augment human capabilities, not replace us: Infosys founder Narayana Murthy","Deepfakes are an issue or even in the context of any technology getting into an evil mind, that's always an issue, says Infosys founder Narayana Murthy ","As the Infosys Science Foundation marked 15 years, Moneycontrol sat down with Infosys founder and the foundation's trustee Narayana Murthy for a wide- ranging interview at his office in Bengaluru.  Murthy spoke about his prescription to improve primary and secondary education in India, his views on AI and the future of jobs, and why entrepreneurship needs more societal acceptance.  Edited excerpts  It's been 15 years of the Infosys Science Foundation and 15th edition of the Infosys Prize. Do you believe it's achieved the objectives that you envisioned while launching over a decade ago?  The transformation of the educational system in a country is a marathon. It takes a long time. It doesn't happen quickly. So it is unfair for us at Infosys Science Foundation to expect the foundation of higher education and research to produce very tall structures as quickly as 15 years. However, we do see that our objective of creating role models for our youngsters who are in the field of research is working, because I meet lots of youngsters in research in physics, mathematics, economics, biology, all of that. And they do talk to me about how they're enthused by our honouring these role models. So, it has become an approbation for these youngsters.  What else needs to be done by the government and the private sector to encourage funding science and research in India?  When India took part in Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) Test of the European Union, we were if I'm not wrong, 71st out of 72 countries. PISA is a test for primary and secondary education. And the then Government of India under Dr. Manmohan Singh, they stopped participating in this. However, this government has done a remarkable thing, I must congratulate them on creating the National Education Policy (NEP) committee. We have had Dr. Kasturirangan, a remarkable individual. We have had Manjul Bhargava and others. They have come out with a very good report, there's absolutely no doubt about it.  But the true test of the success of is how well we, the ordinary Indians will implement that.  It may be a good idea to send a committee of highly accomplished primary and secondary education experts to countries like Singapore, UK, France, Germany, US, Canada, etc., which have done a much better job of primary and secondary education than we have done.  Second, it may be a good idea for us to invite about 10,000 retired and highly accomplished teachers of primary and secondary education from the developed world, along with some competent retired Indian teachers to start a 'Train the teachers' college. Probably we can start about 2,500 'Train the teachers' colleges across our 28 states and about eight union territories.  Each school or college can be assigned four teachers, and these teachers can train about 100/300 primary and secondary school teachers. Therefore, we would be able to train about 250,000 primary school teachers and 250,000 secondary school teachers in a year, because this course can be a year-long course. And the beauty of this is that these highly accomplished retired teachers from India and the US or France, UK, Germany, whatever country it is, they can then help our primary school teachers, our secondary school teachers to teach our children to become critically thinking, to have an analytical mind, to have a mindset of Socratic questioning, to relate what is learnt in the classroom to the nature's mysteries and to connect what we learn in the classroom to solve the problems around us.  If you were to pay each of these retired teachers about $100,000 per year, you are looking at approximately about a billion dollars a year. And if we conducted this experiment for about 20 years, so we're looking at $20 billion.  That's not a big deal, because India has an aspiration and I'm sure it will achieve $5 trillion dollars of GDP pretty soon. And for a nation that has $5 trillion of GDP, spending a billion dollars is not a big deal.  We are also talking about at a time when we are seeing new breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI). What do you make of the pace of change? While AI has been around for many decades, I think this year has sort of been a game changer in terms of the pace of innovation, disruption, new companies that we're seeing.  Artificial intelligence is all about augmenting the capacity of human mind to take on and solve problems that we could not have done earlier. So, it's a very welcome technology. But in artificial intelligence itself, whether it is ChatGPT-4 or whether it's supervised algorithmic thinking. Algorithms, whether it's unsupervised algorithms or semi-supervised, whatever it is, you need lot of data. You need to collect lot of data. Because at the end of the day, machine learning by and large is a very complex piece of pattern matching.  Therefore, our first task would be to move from an oral culture which we are by and large to a written culture, to a documentation-oriented culture, so that we can generate huge amounts of data, otherwise, what will happen is we will use all the data of the developed nations and we may come to wrong conclusions here. Because this is a different nation, this is at a different level of development. Our culture is different. Our heritage is different. Therefore, we must collect a large amount of data that is relevant to India and then only you can use all these models.  Do you think this is something that could fundamentally upend IT services as we know it, people are already writing the epitaph for coders.  No, I don't I don't think so. Because I tell you, it all depends on our ability to use AI more as an augmentative tool rather than as a replacement tool.  Earlier, the world invented a technology called case tools. Case tools were all about requirements analysis. It was all about improving productivity in the design, in requirement analysis, etc. And those tools also came with what are called program generators. And everybody said, there will be no opportunity for programmers, but you know what happened.  The most flexible instrument in the world is human mind. When we had those case tools, when we had those program generators, when we had advanced software engineering methodologies, what we did was, we said, we will tackle bigger and bigger and more complex problems. The moment you started thinking of bigger and more complex problems, these tools could not handle it.  So, my personal feeling is that as long as we use AI as a tool to aid human beings to do bigger things, to do more complex things, I think we will start solving more complex problems. And that's when the world will become a better place. So, I don't see them as dangerous to humanity. However, having said that, in certain areas, for example, if you plan to attack some other nation and if you use AI there, yes, that is an issue. If you are given a nuclear bomb or something, and if you use AI and all of that, that is a problem.  Similarly, deepfakes are an issue or even in the context of any technology getting into an evil mind, that's always an issue. But that is where there are conferences happening all over the world on how to contain the not so desirable impact or effects of AI. And I'm sure that there are a lot of brilliant people who are working on it. So, I am much more positive than negative about it.  So, it won't be the death knell so to speak for engineers?  Yeah, however, in some areas like automatic driving, driverless cars, all those are good. For example, using AI in controlling power plant is an excellent thing, right? So, there are areas where human beings can use AI to reduce the resolution time for reaction and make those systems perform better. And surgery, for example, precision surgery. AI is useful in precision surgery; robotics is very useful. Those areas will add value to the humanity  If one looks at the startup ecosystem, we've had some huge successes when it comes to consumer internet, when it comes to software as a service. But do you see the need for more deep tech success stories to come out?  Well, I think the support that the government has given, the encouragement that the government has given in terms of startup India, all those things, they have had some impact. We see a lot of entrepreneurs now coming out with ideas that we didn't see 20 years ago or even 10 years ago. The confidence of youngsters has gone up. Their aspiration has gone up. Their desire to solve what was considered difficult problems has increased.  But the society as a whole also has to become even more active in accepting that entrepreneurship is a very difficult path. It's not a path where you guarantee 100% success, nobody is and therefore, our society must encourage our youngsters to try more, to try and solve plausibly impossible problems.  And even if they didn't do that, they would be that much smarter, because they are operating at that level, at the leading edge. So therefore, our society has to become a little bit more encouraging in terms of providing youngsters support, cheering them up, as long as they're trying to solve leading edge problems.  While it is very easy to become a software engineer or become a financial analyst, but to become an entrepreneur and say, I will try out this unbelievable idea, which has a low probability. That is what we must do.  Mr. Murthy, we're just months away I think from the general elections in 2024, April-May. It's been 10 years of the Modi Government. As an industry leader, how would you assess 10 years of PM Modi and what should we look forward to? What does India need for the next five years?  My father would say, he would repeat, what the founding fathers wanted for India day after day after day. And that is, I want a country where the poorest child in the remotest village has decent access to nutrition, shelter, healthcare and education and hope that by hard work, by smart work, by discipline, that child can enhance the quality of life, not only for itself, but for its progenies too. That is what the Founding Fathers said, as early as pre-independence days when they fought for independence. So therefore, I think all of us must keep that in mind. That's the end goal. That is the holy grail, right? So, we should all look at how far are we from that.  What would your message be to the current generation? India's a cynosure of all eyes, a lot of companies are looking to increase manufacturing in India. We have over 800 million internet users, favorable demographics. How can we capitalise on all this?  We must ensure that those people who are less fortunate than us will also reach the level that we have and will also obtain the opportunity that you and I have. If we keep that in mind, every day when you get up, what is it that I can do so that most of the people who did not receive what I have received for them to become better than me or equal to me, better than me, then it's very simple.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/use-ai-to-solve-complex-problems-infosys-founder-narayana-murthy-on-why-hes-optimistic-about-the-tech-11752891.html

The newborn is the third grandchild of the Murthys who are grandparents to the two daughters of Akshata Murty.  Moneycontrol has learnt that the baby was born on November 10 in Bengaluru. Both mother and son are reportedly doing well.  The baby has been named Ekagrah, a Sanskrit word that means unwavering focus and determination. The family was reportedly inspired by Arjuna's “ekagrah” in the Mahabharata.  The name also appears in the Bhagavad Gita’s sixth chapter, which focuses on yoga and meditation as means towards self-realisation.  Rohan Murty, 40, is a computer scientist-turned-entrepreneur with a PhD from Harvard University and an undergraduate degree from Cornell University. He is the founder of Soroco, a data-based software firm that helps convert data into meaningful information that will help organisations address broken patterns of work across teams.  Aparna Krishnan was General Manager, Operations at Soroco for a little over four years. She's currently heading Murty Media which has produced &quot;Story Time with Sudha Amma&quot;, a series of animated shows on YouTube, adapted from Sudha Murty’s books for children.  The couple got married in 2019. The wedding in Bengaluru was attended by the close family and friends of both the families, including Infosys co-founders Nandan Nilekani, Krish Gopalakrishnan, SD Shibulal and K Dinesh, and Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw.  Narayana Murthy and Sudha Murty’s two other grandchildren are Krishna and Anoushka, daughters of Akshata Murty and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.

Dispelling fears of AI rendering coders obsolete, Murthy draws parallels with historical technological advancements. Reflecting on the case tools of the 1970s, he emphasizes the human mind's adaptability as the most flexible instrument. Murthy envisions AI as a tool to aid, not replace, human ingenuity, asserting that its true potential lies in addressing more complex problems and, in turn, making the world a better place.  “The moment you started thinking of bigger and more complex problems, these tools could not handle it.

infosys,2023-11-13T14:10:04+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,Nordic region emerges as pocket of hope for Indian IT as other markets slow,"Europe-specific tech partners have not been able to manage the cost inflation situation and the pricing situation as well as Indian players, analysts said.","Top Indian IT companies including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys continue to gain favour among enterprise customers in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway and others, amidst a cut in tech budgets and macroeconomic weaknesses persisting in the overall European and US markets.  The Nordic IT services market within Europe grew to $29.5 billion in 2023 from $24.4 billion in 2018, according to data from UnearthInsight. To be sure, this is still a relatively smaller IT services market by size as compared to the United Kingdom and continental Europe.  The top Indian IT companies, which also include HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra, have been expanding their presence in the Nordic region by building centres, framing localised strategies and hiring a dedicated employee base in these countries.    TCS has almost 20,000 employees in the Nordic countries and also one of its biggest customers, Telenor, as per UnearthInsight’s data. TCS’ headcount has doubled from about 9,000 in 2018.  Infosys has over 2,500 employees in the region. It opened a centre in Sweden in December last year. Wipro has over 2,000 employees and HCLTech has about 1,600 employees in the region.  After sustained growth in Finland, Tech Mahindra announced a new local innovation centre in Espoo in September.  Experts and analysts called this demand uptick from Nordic customers a reflection of the price competitiveness, ability to become long-term strategic digital transformation partners, and the quality hi-tech services provided by Indian IT services companies.    Pricing opportunities  “If you look at a differential between a local tech services or global tech services firm versus Indian tech services firm, it's easily 10 percent to 15 percent, or in some cases, up to 18 percent,” said Gaurav Vasu, founder of market intelligence firm UnearthInsight. “Infosys’ Danske Bank deal is a good example of the growing popularity of Indian IT services firms.”  Infosys bagged a five-year digital transformation deal worth $454 million from Danske Bank in June 2023.  Vasu said that inflationary pressures are expected to continue in the Nordics too, but instead of curtailing overall tech spending, they are opting for vendor partners with strategic capabilities.  “They are open to choosing more optimal partners who can help them sustain at 4-5 percent of revenue, as technology spend reduces from about 6 percent over the next three to five years. European clients believe Indian pure plays will actually help them with around 1.5 to 2 percent cut and partner with them to sustainably deliver the outcomes,” he added.   How deal wins trended for the Indian IT companies in Nordics  Pareekh Jain, founder of EIIRTrend, said a lot of the business from regional service providers are now going to Indian IT companies in the Nordics.  “Indian IT firms are seeing more market share in these regions as compared to global counterparts. As technology is improving, these IT firms are able to invest in new technologies at a scale that regional service providers might not be able to… Only MNCs can invest,” Jain told Moneycontrol.  He added, “Nordics is the first preference for the Indian IT companies outside their other core geographies because it’s easier to access. There aren't many language constraints as most people speak English. Also, unlike countries like Germany and France, Nordics are more open to outsourcing and do a lot of business in other countries.”  Vasu said Europe-specific tech partners have not been able to manage the cost inflation situation and the pricing situation as well as Indian players.  Spending recovery  According to data from technology research and advisory firm ISG, Nordic expenditure on managed-services outsourcing is now close to pre-pandemic levels. The managed-services business recorded a 9 percent increase in annual contract value in the first half of 2023.  Chris Owen, principal consultant, Nordics, ISG, said this growth in tech spending across the Nordics was driven by the manufacturing and financial services sectors. Even the recent fall of the region’s currencies, especially against the dollar and the euro, played a role.  “This has increased the pressure on companies with local revenue bases to optimise costs via technology-driven transformation, alongside partners with accelerators to help. The primary driver, however, continues to be access to talent, partnering with experts to help organisations on their digital journey, and the maturity of the Nordic enterprise buyers is high (some even 4th generation outsourcers now). So we see this being procured from a truly global mix of providers, albeit ones who offer at least some local delivery resource,” Owen told Moneycontrol.

infosys,2023-11-11T13:00:10+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Samvat 2080 | Fund managers believe IT stocks will eventually radiate light,"In Moneycontrol’s Diwali Special discussion, Samvat 2080, fund managers share where their optimism in IT stocks comes from  ","Infosys, which has fallen nearly 13 percent over the last one year, continues to instill confidence among fund managers. And, not just the blue-chip, tech stocks of any category continue to charm investors.  In the Moneycontrol’s Diwali Party to usher in Samvat 2080, Vikas Khemani said that his Carnelian Asset Advisors has been “very positive” on IT, though more on midcap IT, and added that they like Infosys as much. Khemani pointed out that IT stocks are like consumer stocks, from a risk-reward perspective, and that IT stocks now come at better valuations.  Watch: It's fun and games, along with great insights on investing, at Moneycontrol's Diwali Party for Samvat 2080  The discussion was around how the sentiment over IT stocks is changing for the worse with US growth concerns and the market expecting them to make a comeback only in FY25. Khemani believes the IT stocks were &quot;absolutely&quot; on course for a turn around. “We’ve been very positive on IT, not as much on the largecap IT but midcap IT stocks,” he said.  He said that the narrative over the last 12 to 18 months have been around IT demand slowing down in the US but added that the orderbook of Indian IT companies does not reflect this (drop in demand).  According to him, when the business environment is “fluid”, company managements may not be comfortable giving aggressive guidance. However, the companies that Khemani’s team have invested in have seen their bottomline grow 18-20 percent and, he added, “these are large companies”.  Khemani said that Infosys, which is a “great company”, has created “a huge amount of wealth” after Salil Parekh joined as its CEO in 2018. He highlighted the similarity between IT and consumer stocks, and added that IT stocks come at better valuations.  “They (tech stocks) have similar kind of cash-flow, similar kind of growth trajectory… In fact, some of the IT companies grew faster than that (consumer companies),” Khemani said. “So, we've been kind of very positive on the IT sector per se, and we like Infosys as well.”  Lakshmi Iyer, CEO for investment and strategy at Kotak Alternate Asset Managers, explained why she was positive on IT stocks. Infosys was placed in one of the sections as a “ground-wheel” stock, which shoots out sparkles but not vertically. “We need to understand that eventually it will radiate light… That is where the perception is on the IT sector,” she said.  Also read: Samvat 2080: Not easy to make money in a tough market like today, says S Naren  Iyer pointed out that the free cash-flow generation is happening in the IT sector and, with the price-point correction, some of the stocks are “worthy” of being owned. “The sector is absolutely under-owned (when considering the stocks that mutual funds own),” she said.  Iyer added that going by mean reversion and by people’s tendency to rush to defensive sectors when there is volatility, the stocks could see a comeback though that may happen with the lag of a quarter or two.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/why-fund-managers-love-to-bet-on-infosys-and-it-stocks-despite-us-growth-concerns-11724391.html
infosys,2023-11-10T08:59:45+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,MC Exclusive: Tech Mahindra may rope in former Infosys EVP Richard Lobo as new CHRO,"An Infosys veteran, Lobo is currently an HR consultant and strategic advisor at embattled edtech unicorn BYJU’s. He was Tech Mahindra CEO-designate Mohit Joshi's colleague at Infosys.","Tech Mahindra is in talks with Richard Lobo, former executive vice president and head of human resources at Infosys, to take on a global role as the company’s chief human resource officer (CHRO), people in the know told Moneycontrol. The IT services major is currently undergoing a leadership restructuring with CEO-designate Mohit Joshi set to take over from December.  An Infosys veteran, Lobo is currently an HR consultant and strategic advisor at embattled edtech unicorn BYJU’s. He was Joshi’s colleague at Infosys. Joshi was a president at Infosys overseeing several functions, including financial services, insurance, healthcare &amp;amp; life sciences and sales operations.  Moneycontrol has learned that Lobo is currently evaluating three offers: from Cognizant for the role of India HR head; from Tech Mahindra for a global CHRO role; and from a listed Indian IT company, whose name could not be ascertained.  Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar S, too, is an Infosys veteran, who served as the company’s president.  Both Joshi and Kumar had non-poaching agreements with Infosys for a year, to be served from the date of their resigning. Kumar joined Cognizant in January 2023 and the clause may no longer be applicable in his case. Joshi,  however,  may still be bound by it.  But that wouldn’t be a hurdle in hiring Lobo, as he resigned from Infosys a few months ago and has been working at a different company, BYJU’s, ever since.  Joshi also recently hired another Infosys veteran, Atul Soneja, as the chief operating officer (COO). Prior to joining Tech Mahindra, Soneja was the COO of CitiusTech for two years.  Tech Mahindra didn’t comment on detailed queries sent by Moneycontrol at the time of publishing and Lobo, too, could not be reached for comment. This article will be updated to reflect any comments from them.  Tech Mahindra’s restructuring  Joshi officially announced the internal restructuring during the company’s second quarter earnings conference last month, wherein the company will now have a vertical-wise focus for delivery instead of Tech Mahindra’s previous geography-focused structure. Overall, the new CEO has created six focused business units: Americas Communication, Americas Technology Media, Americas diversified, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APJ (Asia Pacific and Japan), and India.  The reshuffle, which will be effective January 1, will see some top leaders take on new roles. As part of that change, the current CHRO and head of marketing, Harshvendra Soin, is shifting his base to Australia to lead the consolidated Asia Pacific and Japan business.  Joshi had told the media during the earnings conference that the company has already made an offer to the new chief marketing officer, who will come on board in the next few months; and is in the process of looking for a new CHRO.  Tech M’s washout Q2 performance  As he takes over the company, Joshi has a big challenge ahead: to turn Tech Mahindra, which gets nearly 40 percent of its revenue from the communications, media and entertainment (CME) vertical, around. The segment has been hit lately as customers are looking to cut discretionary tech spends. Tech Mahindra now wants to diversify its business into other verticals such as financial services and healthcare.  The company's second quarter ended September 30 was disappointing in terms of performance. CEO and MD CP Gurnani called the past two quarters as the toughest he has seen. Gurnani is retiring from the top role on December 19.  Tech Mahindra's net profit plunged 61.6 percent YoY to Rs 494 crore during the second quarter. Consolidated revenue for Q2 declined 2 percent YoY to Rs 12,864 crore, while the EBIT margin or operating margin plunged 210 bps QoQ to just 4.7 percent.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mc-exclusive-tech-mahindra-may-rope-in-former-infosys-evp-richard-lobo-as-new-chro-11714031.html

The Marico founder and chairman has said that employers and employees should focus on the quality and passion put into the work rather than the number of working hours.  &quot;Reflecting on the recent sentiments expressed by Mr. Narayan Murthy regarding the youth working 70 hours a week, I feel compelled to share my perspective, &quot; he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. &quot;Undeniably, hard work is the backbone of success, but it is not about the hours clocked in. It's about the quality and passion one brings to those hours.&quot;  The industrialist added that to ensure that the country's youth is truly engaged and motivated, it is important that they are placed in roles that not only challenge them but also encourage growth and learning. &quot;When an individual sees a path where hard work translates to a promising future, they are naturally inclined to give their best,&quot; the Marico head said.  Elaborating on a healthy workplace that values a work-life balance, he said it is pivotal for organisations to cultivate a culture rooted in &quot;transparency, trust, and meritocracy which is devoid of gossiping, backbiting and politicking&quot;.  &quot;The ultimate objective should be to make work so invigorating and rewarding that the paradigm of work-life balance seamlessly integrates. When young professionals are passionate and see purpose in what they do, the need to 'balance' becomes a harmonious blend of personal and professional fulfillment,&quot; Mariwala added.  Narayana Murthy had sparked an uproar on social media after he appeared on a podcast and suggested 70-hour work weeks to youngsters. In conversation with former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai, Murthy said that India’s work productivity is among the lowest in the world. In order to compete with countries like China, India’s youngsters must put in extra hours of work – as Japan and Germany did after World War 2.  “So therefore, my request is that our youngsters must say, ‘This is my country.

Apart from Amansa, global investment firms like Steadview Capital, Catamaran Venture, the family office of Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy, Sparta Group LLC, the investment office of Desh Deshpande, and other individual investors have also backed the company.  Murthy's wife Sudha Murty and Deshpande's wife Jayashree Deshpande are sisters. The fundraise comes at a time when Deshpande and Jayashree have been promoting an entrepreneurial ecosystem in Karnataka’s Hubballi. Ambit Private Ltd. was the exclusive investment banker for this transaction.  Based out of Belagavi in Karnataka, Aequs, which operates a precision manufacturing platform in Aerospace and other verticals, said it will use the growth capital to launch a new Advanced Technology Products (ATP) vertical that will manufacture high precision components for some world renowned consumer electronic companies.  The latest capital infusion comes months after Aequs had raised Rs 225 crore in April in a funding round led by Amicus Capital.  The increased interest in Aequs is understandable since it is one of the largest Aerospace precision components manufacturers in India, Aequs currently derives almost 100 percent of its revenues from exports.  It supplies precision components and assemblies to most global Aerospace companies such as Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Safran, Collins, Spirit, Eaton, and Honeywell.  Aequs has also built an aerospace-focused forgings-to-assembly manufacturing ecosystem in India’s first Aerospace special economic zone (SEZ) in Karnataka’s Belagavi.  With over 1.2 million machining hours per year at its campus, Aequs operates the largest aerospace machining capacity in India.  Apart from operating 12 aerospace-focused, fully owned and JV units in (Belagavi), US (Texas), and France (Paris, Cholet), Aequs has five more operating units in Karnataka’s Koppal and Hubballi cities, for its non-aerospace businesses.  “We are excited to partner with investors who have a deep understanding of the Indian capital markets, which I believe will bring immense value to Aequs. These partnerships will also help in tapping emerging opportunities due to the realignment of global supply chains and their relocation to India in many instances,” said Aravind Melligeri, chairman &amp;amp; CEO, Aequs.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/narayana-murthys-catamaran-amansa-capital-and-others-back-aequs-in-rs-448-crore-fundraise-11625051.html

The story revolves around an ordinary task that turned extraordinary, shedding light on the convenience and confidence boost technology has brought to the world.  &quot;The other day, my cook came to me and said, Sir, your special diabetes atta is getting over either tomorrow or the day after. So we have to order. I made him sit down and order on Amazon. And, of course, he knew it very well. He's from Odisha. Young man. He ordered enough atta (whole wheat flour), because he knows how much he requires and all that, for the next two months,&quot; Murthy recounted to former CFO and board member at Infosys,  TV Mohandas Pai on the first episode of The Record.  This simple act of ordering diabetes-specific flour online represents a remarkable shift in the way we live our lives today compared to the past. Murthy reminisced about his uncle's days when obtaining essential groceries meant traveling from a remote village to the nearest town. Thanks to technology, the concept of 'shopping' has been redefined. You can now sit comfortably at home, as long as you have an internet connection, and order almost anything you desire, he said.  According to Murthy, technology has enhanced productivity by enabling round-the-clock access to goods and services. He highlighted the convenience of placing an order at 10 pm, a feat that would have been unimaginable in the past when most shops closed early.  “That night when I ordered with my cook, it was 10 pm. Imagine, in the olden days, the shops would be closed,” the 77-year-old said.    Murthy continued, &quot;Sitting at home, you can say, today, I want this item for my dinner, tomorrow something else.&quot; Subscription services and online retail have revolutionized the way we access goods and services.  “In other words today thanks to technology you are in a position to provide better education. You are already very fast growing,” he added. What's more, the convenience of technology extends beyond shopping. Murthy shared that he used to subscribe to a health website that provided valuable advice on managing his diabetes.  But perhaps the most significant advantage of technology, as Murthy pointed out, is its capacity to boost human confidence. As technology seamlessly integrates into our lives, it empowers individuals to handle tasks that were once daunting, making them feel more in control and confident.  “I think these are very clearly the advantages of technology. I think more and more people are appreciating this but there's one bigger advantage of technology and that is it raises the confidence of human beings,” the billionaire said.

But when I go to this machine, whether you go or I go because it will give me the same amount of money, it would take the same time, no issue.' So in other words, technology is a great leveller.&quot;  Elaborating on this, Narayana Murthy added that technology doesn't create barriers among human beings as long as one knows how to use it. &quot;It doesn't care whether you are rich or poor, whether you are educated, or not so well educated, as long as you can use the machine, whether you are from urban India, a rural India, whether you are a powerful man or a weak person, doesn't matter. So technology has to be embraced by everybody,&quot; he concluded.

Infosys was, in his own words, an “experiment in entrepreneurship” – a company of the professionals, for the professionals and by the professionals.  That, at least, is what Narayana Murthy told TV Mohandas Pai of venture capital firm 3one4 Capital in an episode of The Record. The VC firm today released a trailer of its upcoming webseries ‘The Record’, where industry leaders, entrepreneurs, and change makers are invited to share their insights.  Murthy, himself a limited partner in the Bengaluru-based early-stage VC firm, will appear in the first episode of The Record in conversation with its chairman Mohandas Pai. A trailer of the episode was released today and it shows Murthy, 77, explaining why he decided to set up Infosys.    “When I founded Infosys, it was to conduct an experiment in entrepreneurship,” he explained. “I wanted to create a company of the professional, for the professional and by the professional.”  Murthy also offered his insights on technology, calling it a “great leveller.”  “There is no democracy in execution. A committee cannot make a decision. It is the architect who uses creativity to design a building, but a bricklayer cannot say I will lay one brick like this, another one like this – it doesn’t work,” the billionaire entrepreneur told Mohandas Pai, former CFO and board member of Infosys.

India’s five largest IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Wipro and LTIMindtree — saw a muted quarter due to demand slowdown, macroeconomic headwinds and weak discretionary spending. Analysts don't see tailwinds for these companies in the near term, either.  While the management talk across companies has stressed how deal wins have been good and that they executed well in a tough environment, brokerages are of the view that most IT majors have not been able to convert deal wins into growth.  All five companies reported better-than-expected margins on account of cost-control measures, rationalising employee pyramid and efficiency improvements. However, this might not be a sign of sharp margin expansion in the near term. Additionally, the weak revenue guidance by Infosys, Wipro, HCL Tech does not inspire much confidence.  Also Read | Cut cut cut: Indian IT firms slash revenue guidance across the board as growth sputters  IT stocks fall after Q2 results disappoint  Following the subdued quarterly earnings, major IT stocks have seen a fall. While TCS share price has tanked over 5 percent since October 11, Infosys shares have declined around 4 percent since its results on October 12. HCL Technologies share price has remained largely unchanged. Wipro shares tumbled more than 4 percent on October 19, a day after the Bengaluru-based company reported its Q2 earnings.  LTIMindtree, however, gained more than 4 percent on October 19 as the company reported a better-than-expected margin. The EBIT margin was a “positive surprise”, according to brokerages. Despite weak discretionary spending, prevailing uncertainty and anticipated higher-than-usual furloughs in Q3, the management is confident of delivering a better performance in the second half of this fiscal.  &quot;IT companies are expected to face ongoing challenges. The future of IT companies will be heavily influenced by the commentary from the Federal Reserve,&quot; said Shrikant Chouhan - Head - Equity Research, Kotak Securities.

Also Read | India’s top 3 IT firms see headcount drop by over 16,000 in Q2  Which IT stocks to buy?  After the release of the September quarter results for IT companies, brokerages' opinions remained varied. Infosys received predominantly positive ratings such as ‘Outperform’, ‘Overweight’, or ‘Buy’. However, target prices were cut due to concerns about margin pressures and a less robust revenue outlook.    In the case of TCS, HCL Technologies, and Wipro, brokerages have largely assigned ratings like ‘Hold’, ‘Reduce’, or ‘Equal Weight’ owing to a somewhat pessimistic outlook. In fact, some analysts even issued ‘Sell’ recommendations for Wipro and TCS. LTIMindtree, on the other hand, primarily received favourable recommendations, with ‘Buy’ or ‘Add’ calls from analysts.  The way ahead  The major theme emerging from the IT majors’ Q2 report card is that the macroeconomic conditions remain shaky. Elevated interest rates along with weak consumer sentiment in Western economies have led to a persistent slowdown in discretionary spends, leading to delays in decision-making as well as deal conversions.  Further, the AI theme that every IT major's management has talked about is unlikely to be a short-term game-changer. The positive effects of these efforts are anticipated to significantly influence outcomes in the medium to long term.

Infosys, HCLTech, L&amp;amp;T Tech Services and Happiest Minds have all cut their revenue guidance forecasts, and Wipro has guided for degrowth that was lower than anticipated.  LTIMindtree and Tata Consultancy Services do not offer a revenue growth guidance target, but the latter has said that growth this year will be in single digits.  Wipro, the latest IT largecap to declare its results for the September quarter, offered a muted revenue growth guidance for the next quarter, lower than what was expected, at -3.5 to -1.5 percent. According to Chief Financial Officer Aparna Iyer, the guidance reflects a weak revenue environment.  “The weak guidance captures (1) higher furloughs, (2) continued weakness in discretionary spending and higher exposure to the same and (3) some revenue leakage due to wallet share loss,” analysts wrote in a Kotak Institutional Equities note. The guidance, it said, indicates the persistence of weak trends, and Wipro is “on a sticky wicket with continued growth underperformance versus peers, senior executive attrition, lack of mega deals and revenue leakage”.  India's second-largest IT company Infosys, which slashed its guidance sharply at the end of Q1, lowered the upper end of its guidance this quarter, and expects revenue growth at 1-2.5 percent now. Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh told analysts that there are delays in the starting of large programs, and there are the deal closures were also taking longer.  “We are seeing discretionary spend which is coming down and we saw that continuing on transformation programmes being slow, that is also continuing on in this quarter,” he said. This, according to Parekh, factors in that Q3 and Q4 are seasonally weak quarters for the sectors.  Analysts at JM Financial said the constant guidance cut raises predictability concerns.  In the case of HCLTech, the company reduced its revenue growth guidance in for FY24 to 4-5 percent, which was previously 6-8 percent. In an interview to Moneycontrol, CEO C Vijayakumar attributed the cut in guidance to the performance of the company in the first half of the year, which has been weak.  “To deliver much higher growth in the second half or to keep the revenue growth guidance at 6-8 percent, it means, we really needed to do some 5 percent-plus growth sequentially, to get to 6 percent. Given our momentum, the big deals that we won — we had the highest booking in the last quarter. All of that will convert to good growth for Q3 and Q4. But eventually, it was only translating to 5-6 percent growth for the full year, because we lost out in the first half,” he said.  It wasn’t just the largecaps, midcap IT companies too made similar moves.  In the case of L&amp;amp;T Tech Services, the company slashed its guidance to 17.5-18.5 percent from 20 percent. Chief Executive Officer Amit Chadha said in a statement that while longer-term trends for engineering, research and development remain strong, they see long decision cycles and incremental headwinds from macro-economic stress in various geographies in the short term.  Happiest Minds halved its guidance this quarter, from 25 percent earlier to 12 percent. While the 25 percent number was a combination of organic and inorganic growth, the 12 percent is organic alone. CFO Venkatraman Narayanan told Moneycontrol that acquisitions the company intended to close have been delayed, and caused the company to take a relook at its guidance.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/guidance-down-revision-rules-the-results-of-indian-it-companies-in-q2-11560801.html
infosys,2023-10-19T08:37:24+05:30,Kumar Chatterjee,"TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech employee count drops by 21,000 in second quarter","As of the first half of FY24, all the four companies cumulatively lost around 39,000 employees. This is a significant drop in headcount, compared to the first half of last fiscal, when these companies together added 81,650 people","The Indian IT services Big Four, comprising Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech and Wipro, reported a decline in workforce by 21, 213 in the second quarter, mainly driven by a slowdown in hiring, focus on better utilisation, and use of the existing pool of trained freshers on projects, amid rising uncertainty on the demand front.  With the exception of HCLTech, which saw a plunge of 2,299 employees, the other three recorded the steepest decline in headcount in the range of over 5,000 in the September quarter.  As of the first half of FY24, all four companies cumulatively lost around 39,000 employees. This is a significant drop in headcount, compared to the first half of last fiscal, when these companies together added 81,650 people.  Among the other top Indian IT companies, LTIMindtree was an exception this quarter with the addition of around 794 employees in Q2 and the onboarding of 1,400 freshers.    Attrition rates meanwhile declined sequentially across the board, coming in the range of 14-16 percent. IT companies are trying to avoid backfilling this attrition immediately, as improving utilisation of the existing workforce continues to be a key lever to improve operating margins in the current business environment.  What do these companies say?  According to TCS Chief Human Resource Officer Milind Lakkad, the IT major has been heavily investing in getting fresh talent for nearly 18 months, and right now that is paying off. As the company is recalibrating hiring while the attrition rates have continued to drop, there appears to be a net reduction, he explained during the company’s Q2 earnings conference with analysts.  He expects the headcount shrinkage to continue in the coming quarters, though the numbers won’t be this high.  Wipro’s Chief Operating Officer Amit Choudhary said that his company is focusing on operational efficiency as its utilisation went up by almost 470 basis points in the last four quarters, touching 84.5 percent in Q2.  “We have taken several actions here from sustained bench reduction efforts, and pyramid optimisation to onshore-offshore rationalisation and rigour around subcontracting costs. We are also keeping a very close eye on discretionary spending with increased rigor on cost and efficiency management,” he said.  Infosys Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy said that the company hired ahead of demand, and with this theme of improving utilisation playing out, there’s more headroom to work on.  Infosys still has a significant fresher bench waiting to be onboarded. Consequently, the company will not be hitting the campuses this year. “At the moment, we are not going to the campuses. We will monitor this every quarter, looking at our future predictions and then finally decide when we do go back,” Roy said.  HCLTech, too, is shying away from 1fresh hiring for now, though it is on track in terms of its fresher addition targets, which is helping improve profitability, Chief Executive Officer C Vijayakumar said. “Our investments over the last few years on freshers have really started showing results, and that's visible in this quarter's profitability numbers.”  He added that a lot of freshers they hired over the last 18 months are now trained and deployed on projects in the last quarter. Hence, much of the attrition backfilling is happening by internally deploying these trained freshers, which will not reflect in net headcount numbers.  Fresher hiring targets  While Infosys and Wipro are skipping campus hiring this fiscal year, TCS and HCLTech continue to onboard freshers.  TCS plans to hire 40,000 freshers in FY24 and HCLTech will be adding 10,000 freshers. HCLTech, as of the first half of FY24, has hired about 5,200 freshers. TCS, however, has not shared these numbers on a quarterly basis this year.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/indian-it-big-four-record-headcount-down-by-over-21000-in-q2-11559691.html

Revenue grew 2.3% QoQ CC, ahead of our expectations; however, adjusting for higher pass-through and one-timers, it missed our estimates.

Large deal TCV at USD7.7b (48% new) was the highest ever as it won four mega deals during the quarter. However, despite the strong revenue beat and deal inflow, INFO surprisingly lowered the upper end of its FY24 revenue growth guidance to +1.0-2.5% YoY CC from +1.0-3.5% YoY CC earlier, attributing it to continued weakness in discretionary spends and a delay in mega deal scale-up to FY25.

However, another revenue guidance cut to 1-2.5 percent for FY24 overshadowed its strong execution for the quarter. While the IT major is likely to see improved margin, revenues and strong order book in FY25, delayed macro recovery, a delay in deal closures, and pricing pressure may risk growth, according to analysts.  Infosys is well-positioned for robust EBIT growth with improved revenues and margins in FY25. However, its P/E (price-to-earnings) multiples may fall in near-term, according to Morgan Stanley. This anticipation stems from an unexpected reduction in revenue guidance and cautious commentary by the management.  While the Infosys management alluded to strong deal-wins supporting FY25E growth, the weak exit rate of FY24 would mean FY25 growth is likely to be in mid-single digits. &quot;We continue to believe that Infosys is going through some company-specific issues , exacerbated by weak macros. We, hence, expect Infosys to underperform peers in near-to-medium term,&quot; said Nuvama Institutional Equities.  Infosys wins large deals, set for growth next year  Infosys' strength in application services and ability to win large cost take-out and transformation come to the fore in recent deal wins, and these augur well for future opportunities as well. &quot;Even as the outlook on discretionary spending is uncertain, Infosys has won a fair share of large deals to provide some visibility for FY2025E,&quot; said Kotak Securities. A robust order book is expected to provide a solid foundation for FY25, said analysts at Bernstein.  Follow our market blog for all live action  Concerns on Infosys stock in short term  While the reduced revenue guidance is concerning and may impact short-term share prices, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services, it had already predicted subdued FY24 revenue growth for Infosys. Consequently, the brokerage firm anticipates limited impact on Infosys' growth trajectory from the consecutive reductions. Despite anticipated macroeconomic uncertainty leading to modest FY24 growth, FY25 is expected to benefit from multiple significant deals secured this year, it noted.  With expected macro recovery over the next few quarters, the Motilal Oswal expects the company to deliver 9 percent YoY constant currency (CC) USD revenue growth in FY25. On the other hand, it remains watchful of a potential increase in pass-through revenue contribution as the share of large deals continues to rise on account of strong inflow.

At 09.16 am, shares of Infosys were trading 2.9 percent lower at Rs 1,422.80 on the NSE.  Dragged by the dented sentiment, the New York Stock Exchange-listed American Depository Receipts (ADRs) of the information technology major also recorded a sharp slump. The ADRs of Infosys dived 6.5 percent to settle at $16.46 on October 12 following the release of the July-September earnings and a weak growth outlook.  Follow our live blog for all the market action    Infosys has cut its full-year revenue growth guidance at the upper end, now forecasting growth in the range of 1-2.5 percent. The cut in growth guidance was an unexpected whammy for the Street as the IT major had already reduced its growth guidance significantly in the previous quarter, pulling it down to  1-3.5 percent, down from the initial 4-7 percent forecast.  Moreover, the company also reported a good set of earnings for the July-September period, making the decision to slash growth guidance a harder pill to digest for investors.  Foreign brokerage firm Bernstein also expected the stock to react negatively to the guidance cut.  Despite that, the firm highlighted Infosys' sharp revenue beat and modestly better-than-expected margin for the quarter gone by. The company also posted a record large deal value of $7.7 billion in Q2, which is 2.5 times more than that seen in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, a weaker rupee and foregoing of salary hikes so far also helped the company record a 40 basis point sequential rise in its EBIT margin for Q2.  The company had delayed wage hikes in Q2 in a bid to aid its profitability and will now roll it out from November 1.

On the return-to-office approach, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said the number of employees coming back to workspace is on the rise but asserted, in the same breath, that the company intends to maintain flexibility in its approach.  Infosys’ position on return to work is in variance to that of larger rival TCS, which has asked its 6.14 lakh-plus employees to work from offices, ending the practice of remote working that was necessitated by the pandemic. During the Q2 briefing, Infosys CFO Nilanjan Roy said the Bengaluru-headquartered company has a significantly fresher bench and headroom for increasing utilisation, and hence it &quot;is not going to campuses as yet&quot;. &quot;Last year, we hired 50,000 freshers and hired ahead of demand…we still have a significant fresher bench… we are, of course, training them on Gen AI…but we still have a way to go on utilisation, and at the moment are not going to campuses as yet…we will monitor this every quarter looking at our future projections,&quot; he said.  That said, the company will honour all the offers made, onboarding them as projects come up. To a specific question on whether or not the company will go to campuses this year for hiring, Roy said, &quot;As we see it, I don’t think it is likely that this year, we are going to be going…but we will watch it every quarter&quot;. On the return to work plans, Parekh said Infosys is clear that it wants to remain flexible in its approach with employees. &quot;Having said that every quarter, every week, we are seeing more and more employees back into the campus. And we believe this will continue,&quot; he said.  The company’s headcount stood at 3.28 lakh as of September 30, 2023. There are instances involving specific client work or specific types of engagement, where the company is more comfortable with everyone working together in the office, and in such situations, the employees are back, anyway, Parekh disclosed. &quot;But, in general, our view is, we want to support this flexible approach. It’s something that we believe is appropriate given how we have set up the work-from-home infrastructure. And so, we will continue with it at this stage but there will be specific areas, be it projects or type of work for clients, when the need is there, the employees will be on campus,&quot; he said.  For individuals working in locations that house delivery centres, over 70 per cent of employees come to campus at some stage during the week, he added. TCS on Wednesday announced that it has asked its 6.14 lakh-plus employees to work from offices. The company — the first major IT services firm to announce such a move — has asked its workforce to return to offices because of the need to deepen the value systems and a belief in productivity gains coming from co-working, TCS Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad told reporters.  &quot;We strongly believe that they need to come to work so that the new workforce gets integrated with the larger workforce of TCS. That is the only way they will learn and understand, and internalise the TCS values and the TCS way. So, yes, we are asking people to come all days in a week,&quot; Lakkad had said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/not-going-to-campus-for-recruitment-at-the-moment-infosys-cfo-11523311.html

The stock saw sharp selling in New York-listed Infosys ADR shares that have fallen about 7 percent as of 7.30 pm (India time) to $16.25.  “The company trimming its revenue guidance would be negative for the stock,” said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities. “Overall results are not so bad but discounted in prices. Revised guidance would put pressure on prices to sustain while it has maintained margins. Technically the last-minute fall in prices shows that results were not in favour of bulls, hence a gap-down opening between Rs 1,400-1,420 could be seen in the opening trade.”  Ahead of the earnings announcement, Infosys closed at Rs 1464.55 on BSE, down about 2 percent.  Infosys narrowed its revenue growth guidance for the full year at the upper end and has now guided for revenue growth of 1-2.5 percent for the full year. This comes after it sharply slashed the guidance last quarter to 1-3.5 percent from 4-7 percent.  Sumit Pokharna, Research Analyst, Vice President at Kotak Securities, said that Infosys’ Q2 headline numbers were impressive on the back of 2.3 percent constant currency revenue growth on a sequential basis, and EBIT margin increase of 40 bps QoQ despite higher subcontracting costs and partial wage revision.  Also read: Infosys headcount shrinks by 7,530 in Q2, third consecutive quarter of decline  “The company has posted good net profit numbers and a record large deal value of $7.7 billion. However, guidance cut once again at the upper end of the band implies flat to 1.9 percent decline in revenues in the next two quarters,” said Pokharna.  The EBIT margin or the operating margin was up 40 bps to 21.2 percent, thanks to a weaker rupee and the company not rolling out wage hikes so far. The company retained its operating margin guidance of 20-22 percent.  In the ongoing quarter, the company said it will take wage hikes from November 1, which will likely put pressure on profitability.

The company used to roll out hikes to everyone below the senior management in April, and to those above in July. While it has been delayed, the company did not clarify if this means the cycle has been changed.  “Every quarter we have a look at the environment and what the competition is doing — so there is nothing decided,” he said.  In India, this makes Infosys the third company among the IT majors to announce its hikes for employees, albeit delayed.  Tata Consultancy Services, the largest IT company, was the first to say that it rolled out hikes in Q1FY24 to employees, and up to 12-15 percent for top performers.  Wipro, which deferred hikes from Q2 to Q3, has informed employees that the merit salary increases will be effective from December 1. HCLTech deferred hikes for junior employees by a quarter, and said it is skipping merit increases for senior management.  Moneycontrol reported earlier in the day that Accenture has informed employees in India and Sri Lanka that it will not be doing base pay increases for its employees unless it's legally mandated or for critical skills, annual bonuses would be significantly lower than last year, and promotions would be few.  Infosys’ pay hike announcement comes at a time when the company has seen a reduction in headcount for three consecutive quarters, even as attrition continues to trend downwards. The company is looking to increase its utilisation, and said is utilising bench strength.

On the other hand, the company’s profit-after-tax (PAT) is projected to grow 3.5 percent QoQ to Rs 6,156 crore in the September-ended quarter due to easing margin pressures emanating from a weaker rupee, estimated analysts.

Also Read: Infosys Q2 preview: Tepid revenue likely amid weak spends, profit may grow 3% QoQ  Analysts at Elara Securities, in their Q2 preview report pegged the deal momentum in the September-ended quarter to be led by the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and communications segment.  “From the BFSI segment, the Danske Bank deal worth $454 million would lead, while Liberty Global’s euro 1.5 billion worth of mega deal would be a key from the communications vertical,” the brokerage firm noted.  Operating margin, however, is expected to expand 50 basis points (bps) to 21.3 percent in Q2FY24, said analysts, owing to absence of wage revisions.

infosys,2023-10-11T16:51:07+05:30,Lovisha Darad,"Infosys Q2 preview: Tepid revenue likely amid weak spends, profit may grow 3% QoQ","The absence of wage hikes and rupee depreciation may help Infosys expand margins by 50 bps QoQ in Q2, analysts say.","IT major Infosys is likely to see a marginal decline in revenue on a sequential basis to Rs 37,694 crore in the July-September quarter of fiscal year 2023-24 (Q2FY24) amid weak discretionary spends and slower deal ramp-ups, said analysts. However, easing margin pressures from a weaker rupee may help the company to register 3.5 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) net profit growth in Q2FY24.  Analysts believe that continued rationalisation of discretionary programmes, along with extended timelines for execution of existing ones is leading to the leakage of revenues and weak trends.  On a year-on-year (YoY) basis, Infosys’ revenue is forecast to grow 3 percent, whereas net profit is estimated to grow at 2.2 percent, per the average estimate of five brokerages.  Besides that, the Bengaluru-headquartered company’s earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) margin is likely to decline 20 basis points (bps) YoY to 21.3 percent in Q2FY24 from 21.5 percent in Q2FY23. However, sequentially, it is expected to expand 50 bps from 20.8 percent in Q1FY24, owing to a weaker rupee and the absence of any wage hikes.  That apart, the company’s profit-after-tax (PAT) is projected to grow 2.2 percent YoY and 3.5 percent QoQ to Rs 6,156 crore in the quarter ended September, said analysts.  Infosys is expected to reiterate its FY24 growth guidance of 1-3.5 percent YoY in constant currency (CC) terms and margin guidance of 20-22 percent.    On the bourses, shares of Infosys surged 7.5 percent during the July-September period,against a 2 percent rise in the Sensex benchmark.  ALSO READ: TCS Earnings Preview Q2FY24: Moderate growth to continue despite major deal wins  Key monitorables: Investors will watch out for the management’s commentary on the ramp-up timelines of mega deals, margin levers, especially noting that back-ended growth guidance is based on typically margin-dilutive large and mega-deals, a discretionary spending environment, especially in impacted verticals, the reasons for senior leadership exits and replacements, and the effective date for a wage revision.  Here’s what top brokerages estimate for Infosys’ Q2FY24 numbers:  Jefferies  The global brokerage firm forecasts revenue growth to remain soft at 1 percent QoQ in constant currency (CC) terms to $4,555 million—in line with the previous quarter, owing to continued weakness in discretionary spends while deal ramp-ups help absorb some impact of the revenue leakage. In rupee terms, revenue is pegged at Rs 36,538 crore in Q2FY24, up 1.6 percent QoQ and 5.5 percent YoY.  The IT major’s margin, meanwhile, is expected to expand 20 bps QoQ driven by higher utilisation and cost efficiencies. Analysts expect the company to retain its FY24 growth guidance of 1-3.5 percent YoY in CC terms and margin guidance of 20-22 percent.  Motilal Oswal  Analysts see muted revenue growth of 0.8 percent in CC terms for Infosys due to the demand slowdown and lack of a meaningful contribution from recently signed mega deals. Though deal total contract values (TCVs) look attractive amid mega wins in recent days, the analysts said they would closely monitor the ramp-ups of these wins.  The operating margin, however, is expected to remain stable due to weak topline growth, which entails no wage hikes this quarter. The brokerage firm shared a ‘buy’ call on the counter, with a target price of Rs 1,680 per share.  ALSO READ: Will the IT sector turn the corner in Q2? Here’s what analysts are saying  Kotak Institutional Equities  The brokerage firm projected Infosys adjusted PAT to grow 4.5 percent QoQ to Rs 6,215 crore in Q2FY24 from Rs 6,021 crore in Q1FY24. The company’s Ebitda, however, is expected to decline marginally, by 0.6 percent QoQ to Rs 9,005 crore in the September-ended quarter. As a result, the Ebit margin is likely to see a drop of 22 bps QoQ to 23.5 percent.  On the deal TCV front, analysts foresee large announcements of $5-5.6 billion, retaining the revenue growth guidance of 1-3.5 percent in CC terms.  Elara Securities  Analysts see deal momentum in the September-ended quarter being led by the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and communications segments, given the Danske Bank deal worth $454 million in the former and Liberty Global’s 1.5-billion-euro megadeal in the latter. That apart, analysts observed that the IT services company may clock a 50 bps margin expansion on a sequential basis to 21.3 percent in Q2 amid the absence of wage hikes.  JM Financial Institutional Securities  The brokerage firm expects revenue to grow in 1 percent QoQ in CC terms with 20 bps cross-currency tailwinds translating into 0.8 percent QoQ revenue growth in dollar terms. A weaker rupee, coupled with operational efficiencies, is expected to improve Infosys’ Ebit margins by 24 bps QoQ. On the other hand, the company’s net profits are expected to surge 4.3 percent QoQ to Rs 6,202 crore in Q2FY24.

infosys,2023-10-06T09:36:44+05:30,Abhishek Mukherjee,Analyst Call Tracker: Gloom persists for Infosys as macro headwinds weigh,"The Bengaluru-headquartered firm, once the bellwether of the Indian IT industry, topped the list of companies which saw the most downgrades over the past year.","Infosys continued to languish at the bottom half of analysts’ wishlists in September as cuts in discretionary tech spends and delays in decision making due to recessionary headwinds in the West sapped appetite for the stock.  The Bengaluru-headquartered firm, once the bellwether of the Indian IT industry, topped the list of companies which saw the most downgrades over the past year, as per Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for September 2023.  With 18 ‘buy’, 15 ‘hold’ and 11 ‘sell’ ratings, it also features among companies with the most pessimism score, which we define as the percentage of sell-side analysts who have a “hold” or “sell” call.    While most IT firms had a sombre start to the FY24 earnings season, Infosys shocked the Street by sharply cutting its revenue growth guidance (on constant currency basis) for the fiscal year to just 1-3.5 percent from 4-7 percent.  For context, Infosys had given a revenue growth guidance of 14 – 16 percent in FY23.  Analyst Call Tracker | Banking, capex-driven plays surface as Street’s choice for September  The aftershocks of its Q1 show continued to be felt in September as well, going by the analyst commentary.  The IT industry is bearing the brunt of an uncertain demand environment due to economic growth concerns in the US and Europe – the bread-and-butter markets for domestic IT services firms.  Additionally, weakness in industry verticals like banking, retail and manufacturing spells trouble for companies which derive a large chunk of their topline from these segments.  For the year ended March 2023, the US and Europe contributed 61.4 percent and 25.2 percent to Infosys’ total revenue. Segment-wise, BFSI contributed 31.3 percent of revenue, while retail and communications accounted for 14.3 percent and 12.8 percent, respectively.  “From a near-term perspective, we believe global uncertainties and economic slowdown may impact the automation spend and result in delays in investment decisions in North America from where the company earns its majority of the revenue,” Axis Securities said in a recent report.  Problems galore  Analysts at JPMorgan said the lowered revenue guidance is “realistic” given the uncertain macro environment and the fact that paused projects may have limited visibility of restarting coupled with low signs of demand recovery over the next 6-9 months.  “Infosys has lost predictability, growth leadership and margin stability and witnessed diluted cash conversion in addition to loss of senior management muscle to competition,” they added.  Many analysts have flagged the management-level attrition at Infosys as a major cause for concern.    &amp;nbsp;  Infosys Executive Vice President and former head of human resources Richard Lobo resigned from the company in August.  This came following the exits of two presidents — Mohit Joshi and Ravi Kumar S — both of whom were future CEO candidates who resigned from the company within a six month span. Both have gone on to become CEOs of Infosys’ rivals: Ravi Kumar S as the CEO of Cognizant, and Mohit Joshi as the incoming CEO of Tech Mahindra where he takes charge in December.  When asked about top-level exits at the company after the company presented its results for the first quarter of FY24, CEO Parekh said the company has rolled out a new leadership structure within the company.  “We have the great fortune of having incredible leadership talent within the company. And each of them, several of them are stepping up into new roles, driving the growth of this business,” he said.  Analyst Call Tracker | In a sea of ‘buys,’ this brokerage has a ‘sell’ call on NTPC  In a recent note, Kotak Institutional Equities said that the company does have bench strength. “At the same time, we also recognize that it takes time for new leaders to settle into the roles. Further, senior leaders that departed recently may tap in to the Infosys talent pool. We do expect some transient impact although it is difficult to quantify,” the note read.  Silver Lining  To be fair, it is not all gloom-and-doom for the company.  Even in a mostly forgettable Q1, its total contract value (TCV) stood strong with eight quarter-high deal wins at USD 2.3 billion.  “The company's pipeline looks promising… with strong large deals and a continued presence of mega deals and 80 generative AI projects. Clients have responded positively to their AI and generative AI platform. Internal development features open-source generative AI tools for various applications,” analysts at Arihant Capital said.  The company's infrastructure, cloud, and OEM services have promising deal pipelines, indicating a positive growth outlook. Despite the setback of the guidance cut, the long-term demand for IT services remains strong, and once the macro environment stabilizes, there is potential for a significant bounce-back for IT services companies like Infosys, they added.  With the Q2 earnings season set to begin, many analysts expect largecap IT firms to continue their deal win momentum, though the overall numbers are likely to be muted.  “Companies such as TCS, Infosys and HCL have recently reported many large and long[1]term deals…and also mentioned that clients are still continuing their long-term transformation journeys through re-investing the cost saved from the cost optimisation deals. This increase in number of long-term deals further cemented our belief that long-term growth of India IT industry is still intact with a blip of year (FY24) on the back of weak/uncertain macro,” B&amp;amp;K Securities said.

Growth divergence to continue  Nomura expects largecap IT players to report revenue growth in the range of -1 percent to +2 percent on-quarter, while midcaps are likely to fare better with expectations of 0.7 to 3.3 percent sequential growth in constant currency terms.  Among largecap players, the brokerage firm forecasts LTIMindtree to deliver the strongest revenue growth at 2 percent sequentially, while Tech Mahindra is likely to emerge as a laggard in the pack, with a de-growth of 1 percent in the September quarter.

The EBIT margin for industry majors like  Infosys, Tech Mahindra, LTIMindtree, Persistent Systems and L&amp;amp;T Tech will also remain under pressure with salary hikes and weak revenue growth playing as major headwinds.  Given the divergence in financial performance across the IT pack, management commentaries on the deal pipelines and timely ramp-up of projects will take the centerstage.  On that front, Nomura expects, HCL Tech and Infosys to retain growth guidance for the current fiscal.  No sign of revival in discretionary demand   Nomura sees multiple headwinds hampering the growth trajectory for IT companies in the near term, and hence, the firm has rolled out a cautious stance on the sector. It also attributed limited visibility of a significant turnaround in discretionary demand for IT services as the major factor behind the caution.

infosys,2023-10-02T08:22:57+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Jefferies keeps 'buy' call only on these two IT stocks amid uncertain sector outlook,"With demand environment uncertain and valuations looking rich, the analysts suggest a selective approach. They have predicted a 0.5 percent on-quarter growth in revenue for the companies under their coverage in September","After two quarters of decline in revenues, some of the biggest companies in the Indian IT sector may see a small rise in topline, according to analysts at Jefferies.  The analysts have predicted a 0.5 percent on-quarter growth in revenue for the companies under their coverage in September.  In their latest report on Computer Services and IT Consulting sector, the analysts wrote that the sector’s valuation is rich and that they would be selective in their picks, having 'buy' calls only on Infosys and Coforge. The analysts pointed to the NiftyIT's 7 percent outperformance versus Nifty over the last two months, and stated that the absence of positive commentary from the IT firms during this earnings season could adversely impact the stock performance.  Also read: Generative AI to drive economic value worth $2.6–$4.4 tn annually: Nasscom-Mckinsey report  “We note that the growth is still soft, given the challenging demand environment, but expect some stabilization and deal ramp-ups to drive a slight growth uptick. Among large-sized IT firms, we expect revenue growth to range between -1 percent and +1 percent QoQ. We expect Infosys (+1 percent QoQ) to lead on growth, while TechM (-1 percent QoQ) and Wipro (-1 percent QoQ) are likely to lag,” they said in the note.  They added that, among mid-sized firms, they expect Coforge to lead with 2.5 percent QoQ growth, and growth at LTIM to be soft at 1 percent QoQ. “Deal TCV (total contract value) is likely to be strong for TCS/Infosys and HCLTech given multiple large deal announcements, but soft for other firms,” said the report.  They suggest remaining selective, since their recent interactions with IT firms and Accenture’s “tepid guidance” suggest that demand uncertainty persists and a recovery is still not in slight. “Given this, we believe that consensus estimates of 8%+ US$ revenue growth in FY25 (+80bps vs our estimates) are at risk. Our FY25 EPS estimates are up to 10% below consensus estimates. We thus believe that the sector's valuation at 24x PE - a 20 percent premium to 10-year average and 28 percent premium to Nifty - is rich,” they wrote.  In the second quarter, they expect the margins to be flattish for the companies under their coverage “with tepid growth offering limited scope for margin expansion”. While they expect a 20-40bps margin expansion for TCS, Infosys and HCLTech, driven by higher utilization and operational efficiencies, they forecast a “sharp margin contraction” of 170bps for LTIM due to wage hikes and 80bps for TechM due to provision on receivables and revenue decline. They estimate that Wipro's margins will contract by 30bps due to revenue decline.  In the second quarter earnings season, the analysts said that they would be focussed on commentary around demand environment and any signs of improvement or expectations of recovery in the second half of this fiscal. They added that any commentary around generative AI would also be of interest.  Also read: We're in the middle of a tech revolution, not interested in timing IT stocks, says Saurabh Mukherjea  “For TCS, we expect a buyback and focus on strategic direction under new leadership. For Infosys, focus would be on leadership churn and its margin program. For TechM, focus would be on strategy under the new CEO and margin recovery. For Coforge, focus would be on execution post the Barings stake sale,” they wrote.  “We do not expect any change to FY24 guidance for any firm, except for HCLTech, which could hint towards achieving lower end of margin guidance.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jefferies-keeps-buy-call-only-on-these-two-it-stocks-amid-uncertain-sector-outlook-11461841.html

infosys,2023-09-29T12:52:50+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,Accenture’s results don’t offer much relief for Indian IT’s Q2 numbers,Indian IT companies are experiencing the same market pressures and cannot fully escape the negative macro environment. ,"Accenture’s mixed set of earnings numbers and its subdued guidance for the next year sent the American Depository Receipts of Infosys and Wipro tumbling by as much as 3 percent in overnight US trading. The results of the Dublin-based IT company, which has a large percentage of its workforce in India, may indicate how Indian rivals such as Infosys and Tata Consultancy Service are likely to shape up.  As analysts expected, the results don’t offer much cause for cheer for the Indian IT sector, and the gloom is expected to continue in Q2 as well — discretionary spending is yet to return, there is broad-based weakness in the communications, media and technology (CMT) vertical, and clients are signing fewer smaller deals as they prioritise larger programmes and focus on cost optimisation.  Accenture estimated revenue growth of 2 to 5 percent in FY24, and CEO Julie Sweet said the company is not assuming an improvement in the discretionary spending environment or the macro. According to a note by Kotak Institutional Equities, this is the “second-lowest among the beginning of year guidance in the past 16 years.”  Everest Group CEO Peter Bendor-Samuel told Moneycontrol there is a heavy component of weak market sentiment playing in Accenture's forward-looking commentary.  “Accenture is seeing clients being worried about global macro while considering spending decisions… Indian firms are experiencing the same market pressures of significantly diminished discretionary spend and reluctance to commit to new significant initiatives,” he said. “This will affect all of the IT Indian industry. Those firms with strong cost-cutting offerings such as TCS, HCL, Cognizant and Infosys will have aspects to their business which will partially offset these negative headwinds, but even these firms cannot fully escape the negative macro environment.”  Near-term concerns  Accenture’s bookings declined 10 percent and its revenue growth of 4 percent in its last quarter was driven by managed services, while consulting declined 2 percent year-on-year.  Analysts at Kotak said in their note that Accenture’s results and guidance reiterated “continued weakness in discretionary spending even as enterprises are willing to invest in core modernisation and cloud migration.”  Due to the weakness in the CMT vertical and the decline in consulting, it expects Tech Mahindra and Wipro to be impacted more.  “Caution on the macro is leading to clients looking for cost savings to fund transformation programmes. Cost take-out programmes are the dominant source of demand for Indian IT. The opportunity is not democratic and better addressed by select companies,” Kotak said.  Motilal Oswal said Accenture’s performance last quarter and the outlook for the next one add to concerns over the near-term demand environment.  “Additionally, 4Q deal booking declined 3% QoQ vs. company guidance of flat growth, implying lower visibility on demand in the current environment… In our view, ACN’s commentary implies near-term weakness for Indian IT companies,” it said in a note.  Jefferies said in a note that the sharp moderation in deal booking in consulting and managed services suggests rising scrutiny on IT spends. The limited growth in consulting bookings/revenue could be seen negatively for Wipro and a muted outlook for North America and the CMT vertical offers negative read-throughs for Tech Mahindra and LTIMindtree.  Pickup in 2HFY24?  While expectations initially were that Indian IT would pick up in the second half of the financial year, there is concern now that growth will be subdued. Jefferies said the tepid growth guidance and a sharp decline in the managed services bookings of Accenture in Q4 suggest that demand recovery is likely to be more gradual than expected.  JM Financial said Accenture’s guidance “pushes out hopes of a second-half recovery (Y/E March) for India IT Services players.”  “Besides, a modest implied growth rate through 2HFY24 for ACN risks India IT Services players’ FY25 revenue growth estimates as well. This, we believe, is an incremental negative… Continued weakness in North America’s BFSI and Hi-tech, though not surprising, indicates demand has not bottomed yet. ACN's commentary that weaker macro is taking its toll on the pace of spending of even the larger programmes could mean that large deal ramp-ups could take even longer, further impacting revenue growth,” it said.  In its note, Kotak said that a macro improvement is difficult to predict.  “We expect the current scenario to continue in 2HFY24 and some uptick in discretionary spending in FY2025 especially in BFSI and hi-tech verticals,” it said.  For Indian IT, while there have been many large-deal announcements in the past quarter, Everest’s Bendor-Samuel said there is significant indecision, creating delays and difficulties in getting them across the line.  “Contributing to this indecision is the prospect of recession next year. As the direction of the US and EU economies becomes clearer, we expect the pace of deal closing to accelerate. This increase in deal velocity is likely to occur regardless of the direction the economy takes,” he said.  Thanks to this, he said deal velocity is likely to increase in the fourth quarter and accelerate further next year.  “However, the nature of these large deals will shift, depending on the strength of the economy. With a recession, we expect to see an increase in large deals driven by portfolio consolidation and other cost-saving strategies. With an improving economy, we expect to see more large transformational and modernisation deals. The lower comparables this year will also make market acceleration easier in 24. Hence, we expect a somewhat better 24 followed by a stronger 25,” he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/accentures-results-dont-offer-much-relief-for-indian-its-q2-numbers-11450551.html

Narayana Murthy.","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s wife Akshata Murty has decided to liquidate her investment company Catamaran Ventures UK Ltd, according to official company filings with the UK’s Companies House this week.  The 43-year-old businesswoman had incorporated the venture in 2013 with her husband as one of the directors before he resigned in 2015. According to the latest financial statement for the year ended December 2022 available for the company on Wednesday, Murty as the only director of the firm has now decided to wind down her firm as a going concern. &quot;During the year, the directors have decided to liquidate the Company, notes the Companies House filing statement.&quot;  Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis other than going concern and no adjustments were necessary in these financial statements to reduce assets to their realisable values or to provide for liabilities arising from that decision, it reads. The value of the company’s investments for the period was stated at just over GBP 3.8 million, up from just over GBP 3.5 million in 2021 and the funds due to Murty amounted to just over GBP 4.6 million.

Catamaran Ventures UK Ltd has been operating as an investment vehicle for funds from her shares in Infosys, the Indian software giant co-founded by her father N.R. Narayana Murthy. However, the ventures it has invested in have not had the best run. According to an analysis by The Times’ newspaper, education start-up Mrs Wordsmith backed by Catamaran closed less than six months after receiving GBP 650,000 from the UK government’s pandemic support scheme called Future Fund. The New Craftsmen, a Catamaran-backed furniture company which closed in November 2022, also benefited from the fund. And, Digme Fitness, a boutique London fitness chain of which Murty was a director, failed in 2021.  Study Hall, an education technology business in which Catamaran has a stake, was given a government grant of GBP 349,976 via state body Innovate UK last year, prompting questions from the Opposition Labour Party benches. Murty’s investments outside Catamaran also came under the spotlight this year when it emerged she had shares in Koru Kids one of six childminder agencies in England that stood to benefit from a new Budget scheme announced by the Sunak-led government. It led to a declaration of interest inquiry by the UK parliamentary watchdog, which concluded last month that Sunak’s failure to reference his wife’s shares in Koru Kids arose out of confusion and was accordingly inadvertent.

Infosys will largely benefit from the likely recovery in the highly impacted verticals - BFSI, Communication (MNC telecom company deal win of $1.6 bn) and Hi-tech in the next few quarters aided by deal wins and ramp-up of deal pipeline. As global uncertainties subside, gradual acceleration in discretionary spending is anticipated, further driving growth for IT companies. Despite the uncertain macro environment, the strong competitive strengths are expected to provide resilience to revenue growth profile through large/mega deals wins and robust deal pipeline while margin expansion is expected to be aided by improvement in operational levers.

Instead, for more than two decades, the 73-year-old philanthropist has relied on sarees gifted to her by her sister, close friends and, occasionally, the NGOs she is associated with.  Once an avid shopper who liked buying clothes and putting outfits together, Sudha Murty is now content with her “100 percent no shopping policy,” according to The Voice of Fashion magazine.  Her change of heart happened during a trip to Varanasi, when she vowed to give up all shopping except for basic necessities like food, water and medicines. “It is said that when you go to Kashi you should give up something you like very much. I used to love shopping and so my promise to the Ganga was that I would give up shopping for this lifetime,” she said in a 2018 interview with the magazine.  Murty believes the lessons she learned from her mother and grandmother have helped her on her journey of minimalism and decluttering.  “When my mother passed away 6 years ago it took us just half an hour to give away the things in her cupboard because she had just 8-10 sarees in it. When my grandma passed away 32 years ago, she had just 4 sarees,” she recalled.  “They travelled light on this earth and since that has been part of my upbringing, I found it easier to adopt a simpler life with fewer possessions,” said the billionaire philanthropist and chairperson of Infosys Foundation.  Sudha Murty also said her husband, Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy, gave her two sarees on their wedding – “I was so happy to have them. I did not want more,” she said.  “Even today, I find it difficult to understand the seasonal trends and seasonal collections from fashion designers. How long can you go on following the dictates of fashion?” said Murty, whose daughter Akshata Murty is a trained fashion designer.  Akshata Murty, who is married to UK PM Rishi Sunak, started her own clothing line in 2009. Earlier this year, she was named the best dressed person in Britain by Tatler magazine, which cited her sartorial choices as “a shining example of modern-day diplomatically decadent dressing that steals the show.”  In this regard, clearly, the First Lady of UK is poles apart from her mother Sudha Murty, who finds even her few gifted sarees to be too many for her need. When she stopped shopping, Murty’s two sisters started the tradition of gifting her two sarees every year. “I told them enough of this gifting. I have too much already,” she said.  The billionaire author and philanthropist still has a separate section for festive and wedding-wear sarees in her wardrobe. On her daughter Akshata’s 2009 wedding, she wore a yellow and red Paithani that was gifted to her by Shivaji’s descendants several years ago.  “I wore that saree when Akshata (daughter) got married a few years ago and it is still gorgeous after so many years!” said Murty.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/sudha-murty-hasnt-bought-a-saree-in-20-years-made-a-no-shopping-vow-in-kashi-11403871.html

GSTN will not under-fund or undersize the contract to ensure there are no problems in cost overruns or size of the contract later. The contract period will be seven years,” he said.  Stability expected  The GST regime, which sought to rationalise indirect taxes, has been changed many times since it was introduced in July 2017. The technology is expected to become more stable, going ahead.  “It will take 10 years for the full concept of GST to be rolled out justifiably, till then changes will happen frequently. We cannot ensure fixed requirements for even six months; it’s not going to happen. The new indirect tax regime was rolled out in the law without detailing fully on the technology. On day 1, they were expected to roll out GST, the law was changing on a daily basis asking the backend to catch up,” he said.  The original GST technology concept involved uploading of e-invoices, creation of a mirror image, both being matched when goods were delivered, and generation of input tax credit (ITC), for which there would be no mismatches.

Whether global players will be allowed to bid for the contract is still under discussion.  “Last time, the bids were restricted to domestic companies. We will discuss that as the concern will be of data confidentiality. We will need to take experts’ opinions as to how data localisation can be ensured with a multinational company and if we can bind them to a law through contract… the board of GSTN will take a call after discussing the pros and cons,” the official said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/mc-exclusive-contract-for-next-gst-tech-support-provider-may-have-flexible-task-based-cost-structure-11386641.html

infosys,2023-09-13T06:20:48+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"Trade Spotlight | Your game plan for Grasim Industries, Infosys, JB Chemicals today",Infosys has formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with above average volumes and sustained above downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of December 1 last year and September 6 this year.,"The market retreated from a fresh record high on the Nifty50 due to profit-taking after a 4.5 percent run-up in the September series. In fact, the index turned volatile after a record high and a sharp weakness in broader markets also impacted the sentiment. Hence, if the index breaks the 19,900-19,800 area in coming sessions, then 19,600-19,500 can be possible on the downside, while 20,100 is expected to play a critical role in further uptrend towards the 20,500 levels, experts said.  The Nifty50 declined 3 points to 19,993, and the BSE Sensex gained 94 points at 67,221, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices were down 3 percent and 4 percent on weak breadth.  The Bank Nifty also corrected after volatility, falling 59 points to 45,511, while the Nifty IT supported the market, rising 335 points to 32,978, the highest closing level since April 13 last year and formed bullish candlestick pattern with long lower shadow on the daily charts.  Stocks that outperformed the broader markets included Infosys, JB Chemicals &amp;amp; Pharmaceuticals, and Grasim Industries. Infosys has formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with above average volumes and sustained above downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of December 1 last year and September 6 this year. The stock rose 1.7 percent to Rs 1,501.  JB Chemicals &amp;amp; Pharmaceuticals climbed 2.8 percent to end at record closing high of Rs 2,924, with strong volumes, and formed bullish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow on the daily timeframe, indicating profit booking at higher levels. The stock sustained above all key moving averages, which is a positive sign.  Grasim Industries moved closer to its record high of Rs 1,930 in January last year and formed High Wave kind of candlestick pattern on the daily charts. The stock rose half a percent to Rs 1,870.95, the higher closing level since January 17 last year, with robust volumes. The stock closed at the breakout point of falling resistance trendline adjoining highs of January 18 last year and September 5 this year.  Here's what Viraj Vyas of Ashika Stock Broking recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Grasim Industries  After an impressive and largely one-sided rally from the COVID lows of Rs 400, this stock started its period of time and price correction in January 2022. Over the past 20 months, it has been predominantly trading in a rangebound by Rs 1,880 on the upside and Rs 1,500 on the downside.  In a noteworthy development, the stock experienced a substantial surge in trading activity yesterday as it made an attempt to break out of this consolidation range. Currently, the stock is trading above both its 21-day and 50-day EMAs (exponential moving average), indicating positive momentum, and it appears poised to initiate an impulsive move.  A decisive breakout above Rs 1,900 levels is likely to trigger this anticipated move. It's important to keep in mind that a key support level for this stock can be found at Rs 1,840.    Infosys  The stock has been underperforming recently, primarily due to the weaker guidance provided by the management during the Q1FY24 results season. As one of the largest components of Nifty IT, it has notably lagged behind the index in recent sessions.  Currently, the stock is making an attempt to break above a downward-sloping trendline, which is formed by connecting the highs of December 2021 and December 2022. A successful breakout above this trendline could potentially initiate a short-term upswing in the stock, with a target around Rs 1,600 levels.  It's crucial to note that Rs 1,600-level is expected to act as critical support.  JB Chemicals &amp;amp; Pharmaceuticals  Since 2020, the stock has maintained a robust uptrend, consistently establishing higher highs and higher lows. Although a brief consolidation occurred between November 2022 and May 2023, the stock subsequently resumed its impulsive movement in line with the primary trend.  Notably, the stock's ability to achieve new highs stands out, particularly in a period when Nifty and other major indices are displaying signs of weakness. This dual dynamic illustrates both the stock's inherent strength and its relative outperformance compared to the benchmark.  A fresh all-time high accompanied by a new weekly high further underscores the stock's resilience and suggests that its strength is poised to persist in the upcoming weeks.

infosys,2023-09-13T06:12:25+05:30,Pravesh Gour,"Hot Stocks | Bet on Narayana Hrudayalaya, Infosys, ITC for up to 12% returns","The next hurdle for the Nifty is the 20,164 levels. If the index can break this levels, it could move up to 20,300 and 20,500 levels.","The Sensex and the Nifty closed below their all-time highs on September 12 after rallying for seven sessions in a row. Midcaps and smallcaps saw a sharp fall, with 90 percent of stocks ending in the red. Midcap and small-cap indices recorded the biggest single-day fall of 2023.  The Nifty50 index showed profit-booking at the 20,000 mark after a strong rally from the 19,200 levels. This is not surprising as 20,000 is a psychological level and many investors may have taken profits at that point.  The next hurdle for the Nifty is 20,164. If the index breaches this level, it may move up to the 20,300 and 20,500 levels. However, if the index fails to break 20,164, it could come down to the 19,950 levels, which is the first and key support.  The overall trend of the Nifty is still positive and it is likely to continue to move up in the medium term. However, there could be some profit-booking at the 20,000 level and the index may consolidate for some time before moving up again.  Bank Nifty has also showed profit-booking in the last trading session after witnessing a breakout of W-formation above 45,000. The immediate resistance zone for Bank Nifty is 45,800. If the index can break this level, it could move up to 46,300 levels. However, if the index fails to break the 45,800 levels, it could come down to 45,100-44,900 levels, which is the immediate demand zone.  Here are three buy calls for short term:  Infosys: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,501 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,460 | Target: Rs 1,584 | Return: 6 percent  The counter has witnessed the breakout of an ascending triangle formation with huge volume. The breakout coincides with rising volume, and it manages to sustain above the breakout level despite weakness in the broader market.  It is trading above its all-important moving averages with a positive bias in momentum indicators. On the downside, Rs 1,475 will act as a strong support; below this, Rs 14,60 is the next support levels.  It is respecting its 9 and 20-DMA beautifully, which is a classic sign of trend strength.  Narayana Hrudayalaya: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,040 | Stop-Loss: Rs 970 | Target: Rs 1,160 | Return: 12 percent  The counter is in a classical uptrend where it is forming a symmetrical triangle formation after building a strong base at its 9, 20, and 50-DMA. A breakout will be confirmed when it crosses Rs 1,050.  On an immediate basis, Rs 1,050 is the horizontal resistance line; above this, we can expect a rally towards Rs 1,160 levels.  On the downside, Rs 970 is an immediate and strong support. Momentum indicators are positively poised to support the current strength of the trend.    ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 451 | Stop-Loss: Rs 435 | Target: Rs 476 | Return: 5.5 percent  After a classical move, the counter has moved into the consolidation phase, but it is trying to bottom out and will move towards Rs 460. The structure of the counter looks lucrative for long-term investors, as it is trading above all its important moving averages.  Both the RSI (relative strength index) and MACD (moving average convergence divergence) indicators are supportive of the current strength in the stock's momentum.  On the upside, Rs 460 is an important psychological level; above this, we can expect a move towards Rs 476+. On the downside, a cluster of moving averages at around Rs 435 is a strong demand zone during any correction.

While banking sector stocks seem to have captured analysts’ attention, IT stocks have failed to please them. Banking stocks have the most number of ‘buy’ calls as of September 11 among the Nifty 50 index, while IT stocks have the most ‘sell’ calls, Bloomberg data shows.  State Bank of India (SBI) tops the list with 47 ‘buy’ calls on its stock. SBI is followed by HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Axis Bank with 45 ‘buy’ recommendations each.  “While all the sectors are contributing to the move, we feel the performance of banking would play a crucial role in making a sustained up move from hereon,” said Ajit Mishra, SVP Technical Research at Religare Broking.    Banking on credit growth  The banking credit growth accelerated to 15.4 percent in FY23 from 9.7 percent in FY22, said IDBI Capital in a report dated September 11. Going ahead, credit growth will be in the range of 12-14 percent, and will be led by higher retail credit growth, coupled with revival of corporate credit, said the brokerage firm.  IDBI Capital also expects housing sector credit to witness positive traction due to the repo rate pause and a strong focus on the affordable housing scheme.  Also Read: Nifty @ 20k: 49 out of 50 stocks participated in the rally from March  IT stocks: Valuation concerns  On the contrary, analysts maintain a cautious stance on IT stocks, mainly due to rich valuations. Wipro has 18 ‘sell’ calls -- the highest number in the pack. Among other IT stocks in the Nifty 50, Wipro is followed by Tech Mahindra with 16 ‘sell’ calls and LTI Mindtree with 11 ‘sell’ calls. Tata Consultancy Services stock has 10 ‘sell’ calls.  Infosys slashed its revenue growth guidance for the current fiscal to 1 percent to 3.5 percent from 4 percent to 7 percent, citing a challenging macro-economic environment as the reason. TCS and Infosys after the Q1FY24 earnings had highlighted the lack of any visibility on-demand pick-up as clients remain cautious, and there is no uptick in discretionary IT spending.  “Our meetings suggest limited improvement in the demand environment. We thus believe that Nifty IT's 33 percent premium to Nifty looks rich given that over the past 15 years entering Nifty IT at these levels, has led to underperformance vs Nifty. We thus remain cautious on the sector,” said Jefferies in a report dated September 7.  Also Read: Nifty @ 20k: Top 10 companies estimated to show highest EPS growth in FY24-25  Other stocks that can move the needle  Apart from the banking stocks, analysts are also bullish on Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro, Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra, and Maruti Suzuki. All three stocks have 38 ‘buy’ recommendations each as of September 11.  On the flip side, other than the IT stocks, Asian Paints and JSW Steel have the maximum number of ‘sell’ calls. Asian Paints has 15 sell recommendations, while JSW Steel has 14.  The Nifty Auto Index is experiencing a resurgence due to increased demand and improved profit margins, coupled with a favorable product cycle for various companies. This has led to the Nifty Auto Index outperforming the broader Nifty-50 Index by a substantial 33 percent during the period from 2022 to 2023, said Jefferies in a report dated September 7. Jefferies expects auto companies earnings to register a double-digit CAGR over FY 2023-26.

The report, titled Cloud Radar 2023, says that while spending remains high, its utilisation is still low. It states that over $300 bn in Cloud commitments made by companies is untapped as only 47 percent of current cloud commitments are utilised which could pose a problem as companies that that fail to meet their cloud contracts may stare higher costs when cloud providers renegotiate contracts.  However, 67 percent of companies increased their cloud spending this year and 80 percent intend to increase it next year.  Anant Adya, Executive Vice President and GTM Head for its cloud solutions platform Cobalt told Moneycontrol that when customers started to embark on their cloud journey, it was primarily centred around efficiency and cost optimisation.  “Post COVID, more and more customers are rethinking their lock, stock, and barrel migration to cloud approach. They are saying that cloud is not cheap. If you are trying to use cloud as another data centre, you will end up spending much more money than what you're spending on-prem,” he says.  This, in turn, has also led to a question of what is cloud supposed to be used for — “which is global, scalable, elastic, compute for fail fast, learn fast, faster time to market, launching new products and solutions, building better experiences for the clients, getting the value out of the data and those kind of things.”  The report states that cloud and its adoption has reached a tipping point and just like legacy systems, it becomes unwieldy and costly with time, adding that companies risk losing the benefits of the new era of cloud unless they take a new approach to how they manage it. As per the report, roughly 50 percent of companies struggle to manage their cloud costs.  “It has reached a tipping point because cloud is a standard thing in every enterprise today,” says Adya.  “Essentially, where the money is being spent is much more on grow-and-disrupt than just optimise. With Gen AI, I think cloud spends are going to skyrocket, it is not going to slow down. On the core technology side, maybe it is looking like that. But, when it comes to getting the value of data, becoming an AI-first company, I think the only leverage that the customers have is cloud, they have to leverage cloud in a big way,” Adya said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/adoption-of-cloud-going-beyond-cost-optimisation-used-for-growth-and-transformation-infosys-report-11331201.html
infosys,2023-08-30T14:24:37+05:30,Arun Padmanabhan,"LTIMindtree gives many employees 0-2% hike, after delay","This is a trend that has been seen with most IT services majors this year, including Infosys, HCLTech, and Tech Mahindra.","LTIMindtree has given several of its employees zero percent increments for the fiscal year 2024 (FY24), amid a tough business environment. Some employees have also received hikes of 1-2 percent, according to employees at the company who spoke to Moneycontrol.  This comes at a time when the IT sector has been grappling with several macroeconomic challenges. Factors such as inflation, an impending recession, and events like the US banking crisis have led customers to become more cautious, resulting in a reduction of discretionary tech spending.  The company's wage hike cycle, which typically begins in April, was also delayed to August. This is a trend that has been seen with most IT services majors this year, including Infosys, HCLTech, and Tech Mahindra.  Sources told Moneycontrol that the significant reduction in increments was also due to LTIMindtree's recent changes to its internal pay structures. The variable pay component was converted into fixed pay in employees' annual packages. Variable pay could be around 8.5 percent of the overall package, one of the employees said.  Another employee cited above said that there were few projects, which meant that people were spending longer on the bench. As a result, they were unable to improve their ratings, which are used to assess their performance.  Employees who belonged to erstwhile Mindtree said that the policies in the new combined entity are mostly those of L&amp;amp;T Infotech, and they are different.  For instance, a source close to the company, seeking anonymity, explained that LTI used to follow an April-March wage hike cycle while Mindtree used to follow July-June. The merged entity decided to go with the June to July cycle from FY24 onwards, the source said.  Larsen and Toubro Infotech (LTI) and Mindtree started operating as a merged entity in November 2022.  Moneycontrol has learned that those who received 0 percent hikes or low single-digit hikes also took to complaining on public forums.  Responding to Moneycontrol’s queries, an LTIMindtree spokesperson explained, “At LTIMindtree, we've conducted performance appraisals for our employees at every level, aligned with industry norms. The percentage of salary increments for each employee is determined by their individual performance, length of service with the company, and market competitiveness.”  In Q1FY24, LTIMindtree missed street estimates and reported a net profit of Rs 1,152 crore, a 3.4 percent jump quarter-on-quarter. Its revenue for the quarter was at Rs 8,702 crore, up 0.1 percent in constant currency sequentially.  Onboarding delays  In April, LTIMindtree was in the eye of the storm for delaying onboarding of freshers it had given out offers to in 2022. Around 600-700 freshers awaited their joining dates.  Reacting to this later in May LTIMindtree CEO and MD Debashis Chatterjee had told Moneycontrol, &quot;People are probably not trying to understand the nitty-gritty but just make some noise. As people go through these programmes, we will have freshers joining in Q1, Q2, and Q3.”  Industry-wide delays in wage hike  Tech Mahindra, like LTIMindtree, has delayed wage hikes for a certain portion of its senior employees to the next quarter, after reporting a significant decline in profits and EBIT margins for the first quarter of FY24.  Wipro, which used to pay out its salary hikes in late Q2, has pushed the payouts to Q3. Infosys, which used to pay out salary hikes to employees below the management level in April and to the management level in July, has not yet made any announcement on the deferral or the quantum this year. During the company's earnings call for the last quarter, Infosys CFO Nilanjan Roy said that the matter is under consideration.  Meanwhile, HCLTech is completely doing away with wage hikes for senior management staff for FY24, who constitute a significant portion of the wage bill. As for junior employees, the IT major has deferred their hikes by a quarter.  The only exception to this situation was Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which gave about a 12-15% hike to ‘exceptional performers’ and kickstarted its promotion cycle on April 1.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ltimindtree-gives-employees-0-hike-after-four-months-of-delay-11283431.html

This is the trend of the next 20 years. This has been solved by a new way of solving problems called digital public infrastructure which solves problems with technology at the population scale,&quot; Nilekani said at the B20 Summit in Delhi.  &quot;Whenever you use a digital platform, it creates data. India has invented a unique idea of how individuals and companies can use their own data footprint to monetise it. This data footprint is their digital capital. And individuals can use digital capital to get ahead in life. This concept doesn't exist anywhere in the world,&quot; he added.  The veteran technology executive said that while the world is dealing with balancing innovation and regulation, India has already achieved a balance through a participatory model of data governance and architecture.  Nilekani cited numerous data points related to DPIs to show how they have seen massive acceptance in the country. For example, he said that India was able to transfer $4.5 billion to the bank accounts of 150 million citizens during Covid owing to DPIs, while 700 million people already have their bank accounts connected to their Aadhaar numbers.  UPI has become the most significant payment system in the world with over 9.66 billion transactions being processed on the network every month and 1.3 billion people today use Aadhaar to do 80 million identity authentication transactions a day.  &quot;India did in 9 years what would have taken 47 years by traditional means. We went from being one of the most unbanked countries to most financially inclusive countries,&quot; said Nilekani.  &quot;All of this wouldn't have been possible without the $250 billion IT services industry. To complement it, we have an extraordinary startup ecosystem. In 2016, we had 1,000 startups. Now we have 1 lakh.

","The Infosys Foundation, the philanthropic and CSR arm of the IT major, announced awards for eight winners in the social innovation space on August 23. The Aarohan Social Innovation Awards had three winners across the healthcare, education, and women empowerment areas, with each winning Rs 50 lakh.  The awards were started in 2018 to recognise those who create solutions for social good that benefit the underprivileged in India. A total of 2,400 applications were received by the jury for the award.  In addition to the three winners, five others won the jury's special award, which comes with a prize money of Rs 10 lakh.  Of the three main winners, nLite 360 won the award in the healthcare category for a portable, standalone, and battery-powered smart phototherapy device that provides customised treatment for severe and dynamic jaundice conditions.  In the education category, the award went to Smart Vision Glasses, an AI assistive device that helps people with visual disabilities identify objects and people, gauge distance, read books in Indian languages, and more.  The healthcare category’s winner was Pune-based NGO Shelter Associates, which created One Home One Toilet, a data-driven model focused on facilitating household toilets for underprivileged urban women.  The five jury awardees were Swaasa, an AI platform for screening and diagnosing respiratory diseases; a point-of-care test for sickle cell anemia called SickleCert; a self-contained portable oxygen generator named Portia; a portable, battery-powered refrigeration device designed for the last-mile transport of vaccines called Emvóli; and the Modha Pedal Operating Machine, which aims to alleviate the pain faced by handloom weavers.  Speaking at the ceremony, Infosys Foundation’s founder Sudha Murty, in her advice to those looking to innovate in this space, said, “When you innovate something if it only helps one or two people, that is not innovation at all. Your innovation should impact many people and you can see the impact of that. For that, you should have vision, understand where the challenges are whether you will be able to make it or not….You should know where the bottlenecks are.”  In a statement, Infosys Foundation Chairman Salil Parekh said, “Tough real-world problems can only be solved with purposeful innovation.

The bonus payout is quarterly, and 80 percent is the average payout for employees who are eligible for it. This comes at a time when the company has sharply slashed its revenue growth guidance for the year amid a challenging and uncertain macroeconomic climate and demand environment.  In an email sent to employees, the management said that the company has delivered a good performance in Q1, “setting a robust foundation for future expansion.”  “We remained committed to helping businesses accelerate their digital journeys and catering to emerging client requirements. By staying focused on our priorities, collaborating closely across teams, and remaining adaptable to changing circumstances, we are confident in setting ourselves up for a productive and optimistic quarter ahead,” the email sent to employees read.  However, the amount that individuals will receive is based on their performance and contribution for the quarter, the email added.  “Performance Bonus budget was shared with Unit Delivery Managers to finalize bonus payout distribution for their respective DUs,” the email said.  Delayed salary hikes  In Q4FY23, Infosys had paid out 60 percent as variable pay.  As Moneycontrol had previously reported, the company has deferred salary hikes to its employees, and is yet to pay them out. Salary hikes would typically be rolled out for those below the management level, and for those in management, in July. During the company’s Q1 results, Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy said that hikes were under “active consideration” but did not provide any details on the same. Wipro deferred salary hikes to its employees by a quarter, and HCLTech deferred it by a quarter for junior employees while skipped it this year for senior employees.  Wipro’s variable pay for Q1 for employees, whose payout is linked to the company's performance, is also 80 percent, as per the company’s Chief Human Resources Officer Saurabh Govil.  Infosys in Q1 saw revenue growth 1.4 percent in dollar terms, missing expectations.

Murthy said that democracy in India will prosper only if a mindset is created that highlights the commonalities of various beliefs rather than the differences.  &quot;US President Franklin D Roosevelt defined true democracy as having four freedoms. These are freedom of expression, freedom of faith, freedom from fear and freedom from want.&quot;  &quot;Democracy works best in an environment of pluralism where every citizen has the freedom to practice one's own belief and faith without imposing it on others, without hampering the progress of others,&quot; Murthy said at the convocation of Techno India University in Kolkata.  He said that in a democracy, one has the freedom to express opinions responsibly, courteously and fearlessly, and where one also has the freedom to seek a better quality of life.  &quot;This translates to the responsibility to create a just society, which embraces the fundamental principle to provide the strongest set of civil liberties and personal rights to everyone, and to tolerate new economic inequalities only if such inequalities ameliorate the conditions of the poor citizens,&quot; he said.  Murthy said that India, despite the laudable economic progress made in the last three decades, has unresolved problems in poverty, population, potable water and clean air.  &quot;India has not put population control on the front burner. The most urgent need at the moment is to reduce our population growth rate. While certain parts of India have made decent progress in reducing it, certain other parts have not paid sufficient attention to this important issue,&quot; he said.

infosys,2023-08-09T17:36:18+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,Indian IT firms may face modest impact from Moody’s downgrade of US banks,"According to analysts, tech spending has already bottomed out for the IT industry compared to its normal levels, any further worsening in the BFSI vertical will now only have a moderate effect","The panic surrounding banking contagion in the US affecting IT companies in the recent past may have subsided but a souring environment is adding to the latter’s woes.  On August 8, Moody’s lowered its ratings for 10 small and midsize lenders, and said it may downgrade six other major banks. This comes at a time when banks are continuing to focus on efficiency gains, and discretionary spending has been reduced significantly.  According to Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and CEO of global research firm Everest Group, this bad news for the US banks will only add to the headwinds that the IT sector has been facing amid significantly reduced discretionary spending in the sector. He added that Moody’s downgrade is indicative of the pressure that banks are under, smaller banks in particular. But it may not be all bad news.  “We believe that this souring environment will only modestly reduce the level of discretionary spend,” he told Moneycontrol.  This is because spends are already below industry norms, and Everest believes it's either at or close to the bottom. Additionally, smaller US banks have been impacted more, which do not contribute to the Indian IT sector significantly.  “The small banks which this most affects or is indicative of, do not contribute significantly to the marketplace for the large Indian tech services firms. On the bright side we believe that this will add more impetus to the banking consolidation that the US Federal Reserve is attempting to drive, and as this plays out the larger banks will reach out to the Indian tech services firms for post-merger integration which will provide attractive opportunities in the sector,” Bendor-Samuel said.  IT companies’ BFSI challenge  The softness in the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) vertical was a common theme across Indian IT companies in the recently concluded earnings season, despite some deal wins coming in from this vertical. While Wipro had said that BFSI was impacted due to softer discretionary spends, Infosys said clients were typically not choosing to spend at this time.  “Large and super regional banking clients in the US have been resilient during this quarter. Large banking clients are focusing on vendor consolidation, cost takeout and self-funding transformation programmes,” Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy told analysts. Infosys said it was seeing different patterns with different clients in the sector. Pressure was visible in asset management, investment banking, payments, and mortgages.  But IT companies have also maintained that the overall BFSI impact has been sporadic depending on the sub-segments like lending, insurance, capital markets, etc.  Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the country’s largest IT services firm, generates over 31 percent of its revenue from the BFSI vertical but has seen some moderation in growth in Q1FY24.  In a recent interview with Moneycontrol, K Krithivasan, CEO and MD of TCS, said, “When we say banking, financial services and insurance, large banks are a component of it. We have capital markets, we have insurance firms, we have mortgage firms – not every sector of the industry is doing well, right like we are doing quite well in banking. But all of them must fire for us to show you growth. If only one segment grows, you don't get that benefit.”  Also Read: Global banking crisis adds to woes of IT firms, slowdown expected in near term  Large US banks reducing tech spends  According to a note from ICICI Securities, some of the largest US banks have started to reduce technology spending on a quarter-on-quarter basis, with the exception of Citi Bank. Banks are also increasingly highlighting efficiency targets from tech spends.  For instance, JP Morgan mentioned on its investor day that it has delivered $0.5 billion in productivity-led savings versus its 3-year productivity target of $1.5 billion set in May 2022, the note said.  In terms of tech spend reduction, major US banks including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley lowered spending in Q2CY23 versus Q1CY23, “yet grew at a rate in line with, or better than, their respective revenue growth”, ICICI Securities said.  While Bank of America and JP Morgan have retained their full-year tech spending outlook, across banks there will be a higher focus on realising efficiency gains through past and ongoing technology investments. Commentary from banks has largely shown that there is a higher focus on realising efficiency gains through investments they have made previously as well as those that are ongoing.  However, according to ICICI Securities, mid-sized banks are continuing with their transformation programs, going by their commentary.  While it has slowed down on a QoQ basis, a note by Kotak Institutional Equities said that US regional banks have not yet announced any significant cuts to tech expenses or budgets, and some have even indicated a continuous pace of investment into technology. Key drivers, the note said, are the necessity to invest in tech to improve operations, keep pace with competitors and also for compliance. In addition, it's also laggards catching up.  “Fifth Third Bancorp, for example, indicated low double-digit growth in tech spends in CY2023. Keycorp is cutting costs in operations and investing in tech. First Horizon is ramping up tech spends to catch up after a period of underinvestment due to a merger plan with TD, which failed. Regions Financial indicated the possibility of tech spends as a percentage of revenue to go up from the current 9-11 percent,” the note read.  Analysts, however, do not expect an immediate revival in the BFS sector for Indian IT. Bendor-Samuel from Everest said that he believes things are either near or at the bottom of the current negative cycle.  “However, we don’t foresee significant improvement this year. Provided the economy does not turn bad next year, we expect growth to return next year and perhaps as early as the fourth quarter of this year,” he said.  ICICI Securities also said that a revival in BFSI is contingent on a revival in discretionary demand, something that is currently weak.    “Weak performance by Indian IT in the banking vertical is a paradox, partly explained by likely resilient spending on insourcing and cloud/SaaS consumption. Focus on expense reduction and tech modernisation at the same time can lead to large cost take-outs while discretionary spends can return post near-term headwinds,” the note read.  Insourcing in vogue  In some cases, even the resilient tech spending by the BFSI sector is not showing up in the IT companies’ revenues. This is largely because the banks are choosing to build out their own talent through captive centre investments and insourcing technology requirements from them.  According to Bendor-Samuel, as BFSI firms move into a mature digital run phase, there is a growing trend where they are looking to control the tech stack.  Kotak said in its note that in a weak environment, it is natural for companies to prioritise their own workforce and reduce consumption of third-party services.  “Demand for outsourced services can normalise once the demand environment brightens. The greater threat is a permanent shift towards insourcing, which banks such as DB have embarked on,” Kotak said.  But this isn’t expected to have a significant long-term impact on Indian IT.  “Although the GICs (global in-house centres) take work that otherwise could go to the tech services firms we do not see this trend as materially affecting the growth prospects for the Indian tech services firms. Simply put, the demand for services is too great and the need from tech services partners is accelerating as more and more of the economy is powered by digital IT,” Bendor-Samuel said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/indian-it-firms-may-face-modest-impact-from-moodys-downgrade-of-us-banks-11135541.html

infosys,2023-08-09T08:40:14+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,"IT deal closures face delays as clients seek pre-pandemic pricing, discounts","Discount asks have climbed to 50 percent of new deals but companies are agreeing in 30 percent of the instances, citing cost pressures","Customers of top IT services firms are seeking pre-inflationary rates and pricing concessions for both new agreements and contract renewals, amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment and cuts in discretionary technology budgets.  Even as firms such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCLTech have denied that customers were seeking any significant pricing discounts in deal negotiations during their April-June quarter earnings conferences, industry observers said it is one of the key factors for the ongoing uncertainties in demand and delays in deal closures, making it a double whammy for the IT companies.  According to market intelligence firm UnearthInsight, there was a price increase of at least 20-30 percent on transformation deals during the pandemic, a hike that clients are seeking to pare to some extent, due to uncertainty about their growth prospects.  UnearthInsight estimates that discount asks have climbed to 50 percent of new deals but companies are agreeing in 30 percent of the instances, citing cost pressures.  Phil Fersht, founder and CEO of HFS Research told Moneycontrol, “Many renewals are being delayed with clients demanding pre-inflationary prices and some even discounts. Providers have to decide if they can afford to drop their prices to keep fully utilised or stand firm and grind out the current slump.”  At the same time, Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and CEO of Everest Group, a research and management consulting firm said that despite the increasing pushback from the customers, IT services firms aren't willing to budge.  “There is an increasing pushback against the post-pandemic price increases, this can cause protracted negotiations and along with the economic uncertainty contribute to the slowdown in pipeline closing and the increase of deal delays,” he said.  “At this time we have not seen a significant rollback of the price increases pushed through in the last two years but there is a growing push to claw back some of these increases and no appetite to allow further increases,” he added.    Impact on margins  While it is hard to determine if this has started impacting margins, a look at the first-quarter earnings across the top five Indian IT firms shows a decline in operating margins except for Wipro, whose margin expanded by 112 basis points (bps) quarter on quarter (QoQ). In terms of margins and the usual commentary, Q1 is seasonally a weak quarter for IT firms, as they roll out wage hikes during this period.  Additionally, this time companies saw weakness in several key sectors including BFSI, communications, media and entertainment (CME) and telecom. Tech Mahindra, which gets nearly 40 percent of its revenue from the CME vertical, saw its margins drop by 440 bps QoQ.  UnearthInsight's founder Gaurav Vasu said discounting demands are more pronounced in new deals and with newer clients compared to existing ones.  “In 2020, when the pandemic hit, the services companies already had to do discounting. So the same discounted price continued for some time, then suddenly when the war for talent happened, the services companies went back to the clients asking for some increase in pricing. Now that the inflation pressure too is coming down, this kind of price discounting is happening in three out of 10 deals, especially with new clients,&quot; Vasu told Moneycontrol.  But company managements denied seeing any significant ask for pricing discounts so far, analysts said.  “In terms of pricing reductions, there have been some sporadic requirements from different clients but largely the pricing environment remained stable,” C Vijayakumar, CEO and MD, HCLTech, said during the company's recent earnings conference with the media.  TCS CFO Samir Seksaria maintained that the overall pricing environment remained stable for the country’s largest IT services firm, instead, there was a “year-on-year increase in realisation,” wherein prices increased to some extent.  Overall, all the companies guided for slower revenue growth and delays in deal pipeline conversion in the upcoming quarters.  Delays in deal renewals  According to UnearthInsight’s estimates, in FY24, the top five Indian IT companies including TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra will cumulatively bag between $70 billion and $85 billion worth of order book/total contract value wins. Of this, renewals will account for around 30-35 percent of the total deals.  The ongoing delays in deal closures are happening across sectors and deal sizes with the exception of artificial intelligence, which continues to remain a bright spot given the Generative AI hype, analysts said. But they also expect revival to happen soon as Fed rate hikes and inflation starts to cool down over the next two quarters.  “Deals are pushed out by 45 to 60 days right now. This is due to two factors – a lot of folks decided to take summer vacation in North America which is a rare thing and the markets had not been sure of a recession in North America. Now, they know that the recession is more than unlikely to happen,” said Ray Wang, Principal Analyst and CEO, Constellation Research.  Vasu said $100 million-plus deals have slowed down, and he expects revival to come in largely from public sector and government deals across countries. Hi-Tech and SaaS should also bounce back from Q3 FY24. Manufacturing, BFSI and healthcare are taking comparatively longer to make decisions and even deals which are won have projects getting paused/taking longer to materialise. This trend will continue for the next 4 to 5 months in FY24.  “Long-term tech transformation deals which have a 3-to-5-year execution cycle and completely new-age technologies like Metaverse or experimental tech investment from clients are either on hold or taking 5 to 8 months to close,” Vasu said.  There are a number of complications this year with deal renewals, said Bendor-Samuel. One of them is vendor consolidation, which is underway with large accounts. Vendor consolidation deals in the initial stages are usually resource-demanding and do not really leave good margins; revenue starts rolling in only after certain maturity. Thus, they are complicated to execute, taking more time, and creating a lag in revenue recognition as workloads take time to transition.  Another factor is the increased focus on cost savings which results in more Request for Proposals (RFPs) but longer procurement cycles.  “For the first half of the year, there has been a lot of indecision as firms increasingly prepared themselves for a recession. This made decision-making more difficult and more drawn out resulting in a significant slowing in pipeline closing,” he explained.  Finally and potentially most importantly new deal signings are paired with a significant reduction in discretionary spending often pre-committed in existing contracts, Bendor-Samuel said, adding, “Hence, book-to-bill ratios which are strong stand in stark contrast to revenue recognition which has slowed significantly.”  The book-to-bill ratio for IT companies is a metric used to explain the value of orders received to the value of orders completed.  Tempering inflation  Analysts have started seeing green shoots in most major geographies like North America, expecting the recovery to kick in the next few quarters.  HFS Research has predicted that with the news on inflation running at only 3 percent in the US, a recovery for IT spends could be in Q4 2023.  However, US banks still seem to be weathering a crisis, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the Signature Bank earlier this year. Global credit rating firm Moody’s on August 7 downgraded ratings of 10 small to mid-sized US banks, adding that it may further downgrade some of the US’ biggest lenders, as the sector reported pressure in profitability in its recent company earnings. BFSI is one of the largest sectors to give business to IT services companies. TCS generates nearly 35-40 percent of its revenue from this sector.  Read: Global banking crisis adds to woes of IT firms, slowdown expected in near term  Ashutosh Sharma, head of research at Forrester Research India, highlighted that the equity markets in North America and India have started to pick up.  “Equity markets have started to pick up in India and North America. Experts are seeing some green shoots appearing, expecting economies to recover and inflation to slow down. It might get delayed by a quarter or two, but there will be a recovery. For the time being, deals are getting pushed out and clients are not opening their purses easily,” he said.  Wang concurred, “Given the recent tech rallies and stock market growth, there is confidence that economic conditions are improving.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/it-deal-closures-face-delays-as-clients-seek-pre-pandemic-pricing-discounts-11128981.html
infosys,2023-08-08T17:20:58+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,How the paycheques of India's top six IT CEOs stack up,"Even as the IT industry weathers dismal earnings and muted growth projections, CEO pay has stayed stratospheric.","Paycheques of CEOs in India’s largest information technology (IT) companies have continued to remain high amid a challenging demand landscape for the sector, as it weathers macro headwinds in key markets such as North America.  Among the top six IT companies in India by revenue — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, and LTIMindtree—Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte draws the highest pay by far, all things considered. However, his income saw a 5 percent decline year-on-year in dollar terms.  Delaporte earned Rs 82.4 crore ($10 million) in FY22-23, a minor reduction from $10.5 million the year prior.  Of the Rs 82.4 crore, Rs 9.6 crore was his base salary, Rs 3.57 crore was by way of allowances, Rs 10.7 crore was variable pay, Rs 34.3 crore was retirals, and Rs 24.2 crore was ‘other annual compensation,’ per Wipro’s annual report. The compensation includes Delaporte’s restricted stock units (RSU).  The steepest fall in compensation among the six may be that of HCLTech CEO C Vijayakumar, who also took home the least among the top five.  He earned Rs 28.4 crore in FY22-FY23, down 79 percent from the preceding year. This includes Rs 16.44 crore as base salary, Rs 11.8 crore as performance-linked bonus, and Rs 24 lakh in benefits, perquisites, and allowances.  Vijayakumar's salary, however, may rebound the next year as HCLTech pays out the long-term incentive (LTI) at the end of two years. He will receive the LTI for FY21-22 and FY22-23 at the end of FY23-24.  How the others fared  CEO of Infosys, India’s second-largest IT company, Salil Parekh earned Rs 56.44 crore ($6.8 million) in FY22-23. Parekh earned Rs 6.67 crore in base pay, Rs 45 lakh in retiral benefits, Rs 18.73 crore in variable pay or bonus, and Rs 30.6 crore by exercising his RSUs. His pay fell 21 percent, primarily on account of exercising fewer RSUs.  At India’s largest IT company Tata Consultancy Services, former CEO Rajesh Gopinathan earned Rs 29.16 crore ($3.5 million) — of which Rs 1.73 crore was the salary, Rs 2.43 crore was by way of benefits, perquisites and allowances, and Rs 25 crore were commissions.  LTIMindtree CEO Debashis Chatterjee, who was appointed to the post in November 2022 post the merger of L&amp;amp;T and Mindtree, drew Rs 17.5 crore ($2.1 million) in salary in FY22-23, a decline of 0.36 percent. Of this, Rs 8.5 crore was the fixed component, Rs 8.8 crore was variable pay, and Rs 16 lakh was by way of perquisites.  Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani, who used to be among the highest paid CEOs in the industry, saw his pay halve in FY22-23 due to the fewer stock options exercised. Gurnani earned Rs 32 crore during this year. Of this, Rs 25 crore on account of ESOPs, Rs 2.7 crore as salary, and Rs 1.8 crore in commissions.    Median remuneration  There is also a yawning gap when it comes to CEO pay compared to the median remuneration at these companies.  Delaporte makes 916.12 times the median remuneration at his firm, Parekh 627 times, Gurnani 466.99 times, and Gopinathan 427.1 times. Vijayakumar makes 253.35 times the median remuneration at HCLTech, and Chatterjee 139.92 times.   IT CEO pay v/s median employee remuneration  Apart from median remuneration, the gap has also been widening when it comes to the pay of CEOs and freshers. In FY22, Moneycontrol reported that while the median annual pay of CEOs jumped 835 percent from Rs 3.37 crore in FY12 to Rs 31.5 crore in FY22, the median fresher package grew just 45 percent, from Rs 2.45 lakh to Rs 3.55 lakh, in the same time period.  The new guard in Indian IT  However, it’s been a year of change, with three new CEOs taking charge in 2023. Krithi Krithivasan took charge at TCS in June, and Mohit Joshi, Managing Director and CEO designate of Tech Mahindra, will take charge in December.  Krithivasan will be paid a basic salary of Rs 10 lakh per month, which can go up to a maximum of Rs 16 lakh per month, per the company’s annual report. However, his commission, which will make up a bigger chunk of his remuneration, is subject to company performance.  Joshi will receive an annual fixed compensation of Rs 6.5 crore (GBP 622,600), and an equal amount in annual variable pay. His variable pay in the first year is guaranteed. Additionally, he can get an annual overperformance bonus of up to 70 percent of his variable compensation.  He is also entitled to a joining bonus of $848,951 (Rs 6.96 crore). In addition, he will get one-time stock options worth $2.5 million (Rs 20.6 crore), 60 percent of which will vest once he finishes a year with the company, and the remaining when he finishes two years.  Further, he has stock options worth $3.5 million (Rs 28.8 crore) vesting in equal instalments over three consecutive years of employment, the first instalment vesting after the first year.  Cumulatively, Joshi stands to make a little over Rs 46 crore in his first year as CEO.  How this stacks up globally  Among the other leadership changes this year is the appointment of Ravi Kumar as Cognizant CEO in January. Cognizant was once the barometer of growth for the industry, and the gap in performance between Kumar’s former employer Infosys and Cognizant has been closing.  According to an exchange filing, Ravi Kumar will make an annual base salary of $1 million, annual cash incentive of $2 million, $4.6 million in RSUs vesting over a three-year period, and $6.9 million in performance-based stock units.  Apart from this, he received a sign-on bonus of $7,50,000, RSUs of a total of $5 million vesting in quarterly instalments from when he started, as well as performance units of up to $7.5 million measured over a four-year performance cycle.  In his first year, Kumar stands to make roughly $7 million (~Rs 57 crore) at the least from his annual base salary, RSUs as part of the new role, and his sign-on bonus.  The highest-paid executive is Accenture’s Julie Sweet, who took home $33 million in FY21-22, according to the company’s filings in December 2022 (Accenture’s fiscal year runs from September 1 to August 31). Of this, $25 million was in stock awards. With a cost of living adjustment for median remuneration, Sweet made 653 times the median income of an Accenture employee. Without the adjustment, it stands at 1,506.  IBM’s Arvind Krishna earned $16.58 million in 2022 — $1.5 million in base salary, $8.9 million in stock options, $8.93 million in RSUs and PSUs and $2.03 million in option awards. His annual incentives grew by more than $5,00,000 to $3.48 million. Krishna made 271 times the median remuneration at IBM.  Capgemini’s chief executive Aiman Ezzat earned $2.6 million in 2022. DXC Technology’s Michael Salvino earned $20.3 mn in the 2023 fiscal.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/how-the-paycheques-of-indias-top-six-it-ceos-stacks-up-11124391.html

","Infosys Executive Vice President and former head of human resources Richard Lobo has resigned from the company, marking the latest in a series of top-level exits at the company. Lobo had moved to a special projects team under Parekh after Sushanth Tharappan was appointed as the head of HR last month.  “This is to inform that Richard Lobo, Executive Vice President and Senior Management Personnel, has resigned from the services of the Company. His last date with the company would be August 31, 2023. The Company places on record its deep sense of appreciation for the services rendered by him and for his contributions to the company,” Infosys informed exchanges late on August 4.  In his resignation letter to Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh, Lobo wrote, “I’m writing to inform you of my decision to resign from my position at Infosys. I’m grateful for the opportunities and experiences I have had during my time here.”  Lobo is an Infosys veteran, and served as the head of HR at the company from 2015 to 2023.  Lobo also joined Infosys in 2000 and headed HR for some industry practices. He is an alumnus of Xavier’s Institute of Management and a mechanical engineer from the Manipal Institute of Technology.  Tharappan taking over the role of head of HR was the second change in the HR function at the company this year. In March, Shaji Mathew took over as global head of HR following Krish Shankar’s retirement.  Lobo’s exit also comes at a time that several members of Infosys top brass have exited the company, and many have gone on to become head honchos at other companies.  Well-documented are the exits of two presidents — Mohit Joshi and Ravi Kumar S — both of whom were future CEO candidates who resigned from the company within a six month span. Both have gone on to become CEOs of Infosys’ rivals: Ravi Kumar S as the CEO of Cognizant, and Mohit Joshi as the incoming CEO of Tech Mahindra where he takes charge in December.  The latest exit is of Global Head of Account Expansion Charles Salameh, who becomes the new CEO of Sangoma Technologies Corporation on September 1.  In July, Global Chief Information Security Officer and Business Head at Infosys Vishal Salvi left the company to be appointed the CEO of cybersecurity company Quick Heal. Narsimha Rao Mannepalli, EVP &amp;amp; Co-Head of Delivery &amp;amp; Head of Cloud, Infrastructure and Cybersecurity left Infosys in June after 22 years.  In March, SVP and Global Head of Engineering Services and Blockchain Gopikrishnan Konnath exited the company to join Cybage Software as President, and EVP Global Head of Sales and Enterprise Capability at Infosys BPM Kapil Jain left in April, and joined eClerx as CEO in May. Konnath and Jain were both Infosys veterans, having been at the company for 28 and 22 years respectively.  When asked about top-level exits at the company after the company presented its results for the first quarter of FY24, CEO Parekh said the company has rolled out a new leadership structure within the company.  “We have the great fortune of having incredible leadership talent within the company. And each of them, several of them are stepping up into new roles, driving the growth of this business,” he said.  In a note, Kotak Institutional Equities said that the company does have bench strength. “At the same time, we also recognize that it takes time for new leaders to settle into the roles. Further, senior leaders that departed recently may tap in to the Infosys talent pool.

","Renowned author and philanthropist Sudha Murty sat down with actor and food critic Kunal Vijjayakar during a recent episode of “Khaane Mein Kaun Hai” the to reveal her favourite dishes from across the country's diverse cuisines and her culinary skills—or lack thereof.  Murty candidly admitted that she is not a proficient cook but she loves to eat. &quot;I am not a good cook. It's not that I don't like cooking, but I don't know how to cook,&quot; she revealed during the show.  &quot;Since childhood, I have always been out with work, so I have not dedicated enough time to cooking. But I don't fast. If there is no one at home, I won't go to a hotel to eat. I know basic cooking—rice, dal, sambar, parotta, sabzi. But I won't know how to make Puran Poli or such items. At home, there is simple cooking.&quot;  Despite her modest cooking skills, Murty takes pride in a few items that she excels at, including a good cup of tea and poha. Notably, she mentioned that her hometown, Hubbali, boasts an impressive 16 varieties of poha. &quot;I don't know how to cook, not that I don't like it,&quot; she emphasized.  The conversation didn't end with her cooking abilities alone; Sudha Murty also shared her love for various delectable dishes from different parts of India. &quot;Dhokla from Gujarat, shrikhand from Pune, basundi from Kolhapur, sandesh from Kolkata, pineapple from Tripura, dum aloo from Kashmir, and jalebi from Rajasthan,&quot; she exclaimed when asked about her favourites.  She also mentioned her fondness for Bakarwadi, a snack from Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale, a renowned chain in Maharashtra.  As a strict vegetarian, Murty expressed her concerns about cross-contamination of utensils when dining out.

The billionaire businessman called out the fifth-generation Bollywood star for refusing to acknowledge her fans as he tried to make a point about reducing one’s ego. He reportedly made the remarks during a discussion at IIT-Kanpur earlier this year, even as his wife Sudha Murty jumped to Kapoor’s defence.  Narayana Murthy said he was travelling back to India on a flight from London when he noticed he was seated next to Kareena Kapoor. He said that several people approached the actor and said hello, but she did not acknowledge any of them. For his party, Murthy said, he spoke to everyone who approached him. His wife, Sudha Murty, also onstage with him, defended Kareena Kapoor saying that as a Bollywood star, she was probably tired and used to millions of fans wanting a share of her time.  “The other day I was coming from London, and next to me was Kareena Kapoor, sitting in her seat. So many people came to her and they said hello. She didn’t even bother to react,” said Narayana Murthy. “I was a little bit surprised. Whoever came to me, I stood up, we discussed for a minute or half a minute – that’s all they were expecting,” the Infosys billionaire added.        View this post on Instagram  A post shared by ENTREPRENEURS OF INDIA (@eoindia)    He was interrupted by his wife who said, “She must have a million admirers. She must have been tired” to loud applause and laughter from the audience. “Murthy, a founder, a software person, will have maybe 10,000 (fans), but a film actor will get a million,” Sudha Murty tried to reason.  Murthy continued to make his point. “That is not the issue. The issue is, when somebody shows affection, you can also show it back, in however cryptic a manner. I think that is very important. These are all ways to reduce your ego, that’s all,” he said.  As billionaire founders of one of the world’s largest IT services companies, Narayana and Sudha Murty are frequent travellers and as such have shared several interesting anecdotes from their trips and the time they have spent at airports and on flights.  Recently, Sudha Murty revealed on the Khaane Mein Kaun Hai? show that she always carries a bag of food and utensils with her when she travels abroad. Before that, she had spoken about being on the receiving end of elitist condescension for wearing a salwar-kameez on a flight from London to Bengaluru.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/watch-infosys-founder-narayana-murthy-criticises-kareena-kapoor-for-ignoring-fans-11021931.html
infosys,2023-07-24T16:57:45+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,"Dismal growth, guidance downgrades, declining headcount: How Indian IT majors fared in Q1",The sector appears to be stuck in a situation where it is seeing strong demand along with uncertain deal closure timelines. Analysts say the sector's growth will fall from double-digits to lower single-digit levels in FY24,"Indian IT majors kicked off a sombre earnings season, where their comments highlighted an uncertain demand environment, cuts in discretionary spending, project delays and a decline in people addition.  The IT industry is bearing the brunt of global macroeconomic challenges, as customers are coming out of a banking crisis, grappling with an impending recession in the US and a slowing economy in Europe.  The top five Indian IT companies (by market capitalisation) have seen their sequential revenue growth on a constant currency basis at anywhere between -2.8 percent and 1 percent, a far cry from the high single-digit and double-digit growth seen last year. The biggest shocker, however, was Infosys’ sharp guidance cut for the year from 4-7 percent to 1-3.5 percent.  The green shoots this quarter may have been companies talking about possibilities around generative AI with regard to client demands and efficiency within the organisation, but it may have to do more with bluster than substance at the moment.  Revenue guidance updates  Revenue growth for the quarter was hit after a period of frenzied activity last year. Wipro reported the biggest fall at -2.8 percent in constant currency terms, HCLTech at -1.3 percent, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) at 0 percent and LTIMindtree at 0.1 percent, with Infosys leading the pack at 1 percent.  In a note, Kotak Institutional Equities said that the slowdown is industrywide, and that TCV or total contract value wins are not translating into revenues “due to tardy pace of decision making, discretionary spending cuts and delay in ramp-ups. Infosys has taken the upfront hit in its guidance.”  It also expects revenue growth downgrades from other IT majors. “HCLT has maintained revenue growth guidance of 6-8%, which in our view is difficult to achieve, noting high hurdle rate for growth in the next three quarters. TCS does not guide but had indicated caution. Wipro has guided for a weak quarter. We do expect revenue growth downgrades for other Tier 1 IT,” it read.  HCLTech’s CEO and MD C Vijayakumar told Moneycontrol that his confidence in maintaining the company’s revenue guidance stems from a “very strong pipeline” which is at an “all-time high” in the ongoing quarter. Meanwhile, LTIMindtree’s CEO and MD Debashis Chatterjee said that given the uncertainty and delays in deal closures despite a strong demand, the company’s aspiration to achieve double-digit growth in FY24 will be challenging.  TCS’ quarterly growth this quarter was the slowest in a decade excluding the Covid period, and CEO K Krithivasan told Moneycontrol that achieving double-digit growth in the current business environment won’t be an easy task.    Operating margins  TCS, Infosys, Wipro and HCLTech reported a decline in quarterly operating margins, while LTIMindtree reported an increase of 30 basis points (bps). LTIMindtree expects further expansion in margins, to reach the 17-18 percent range.  Infosys’ margins decreased 20 bps sequentially and came in at 20.8 percent. “70 bps benefit from cost optimisation including increase in utilisation and automation efforts was offset by 90 bps QoQ (quarter-on-quarter) headwinds from higher variable pays and promotions. Company retained its EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin guidance of 20-22% for FY24,” analysts at ICICI Securities said in a note.  Wipro’s margins dropped from 16.3 percent in the previous quarter to 16 percent in Q1, and the management expects it to remain in the same range in the near future, according to an HDFC Securities note. Analysts at Axis Direct said rising subcontracting costs and cross-currency headwinds may impact the company’s operating margins negatively.  TCS and HCLTech became the biggest losers in terms of operating margins. TCS’ margins were down 130 bps to 23.2 percent in Q1, mainly due to wage hikes and promotion cycles kicking off in April. HCLTech’s margins fell to 17 percent, down by 120 bps on-quarter.  Deal pipeline  With the exception of HCLTech, all the companies mentioned here have reported strong deal wins this quarter. While customers re-evaluate discretionary spending, cost takeout, efficiency deals, digital transformation deals and excitement around exploring generative AI continue to drive demand.  Several large deals and deal renewals were reported in Q1 across companies. For cost take-out deals, however, margins are lower, especially in the initial transition phases. Like LTIMindtree’s Chatterjee points out, the revenue acceleration starts only after the transition is completed. “Because of the delayed decision-making, the transitions are also getting delayed. And that's why the revenue realisation is also getting delayed,” he said.  LTIMindtree’s order book for Q1 stood at $1.41 billion, up from $1.35 billion last quarter.  Read: Do Infosys, TCS deal wins show large contracts are making a comeback in the IT sector?  In the second quarter of the calendar year 2023, too, customer sentiment shifted decisively to a more-for-less orientation with discretionary spend taking a significant step backwards and firms looking to adopt strategies to save money, said Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and CEO of global research firm Everest Group.  He added, “The increase in cost saving-oriented transactions was not sufficient to offset the reduction on discretionary spend with existing transformation projects being cancelled, trimmed back, and new ones postponed or eliminated.”  TCS at $10.2 billion has actually crossed its quarterly guidance band of $7-9 billion TCV, for the second consecutive quarter. The company reported at least five to six mega deals of $700 million-plus in the UK in 2023, apart from a $1.8-billion deal from the government-owned telco Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) won through a consortium.  Wipro reported large deals to the tune of $1.2 billion. According to CEO and MD Thiery Delaporte, this was a 9 percent year-on-year growth and the highest bookings for the company in eight quarters.  Infosys’ shocking revenue growth guidance cut came despite the company reporting healthy large deal wins for the quarter coming in at $2.3 billion, which was up both on a quarterly and annualised basis.  HCLTech’s quarterly order book for Q1 dropped to $1.56 billion, following seven consecutive quarters of holding at $2 billion-plus in deal wins.  Dip in hiring and attrition  After frenetic hiring, it's now the time for the numbers to trend downward. Of the companies that have reported their numbers thus far—TCS, Wipro, HCLTech, Infosys and LTIMindtree—TCS is the only one to add employees on a net basis, 523 on its employee base of 6.15 lakh.  The other four have seen their headcount reduce cumulatively by over 20,000. Wipro makes up the biggest chunk of this pie, with its headcount on a net basis reducing by 8,812. This is concerning as hiring has for long been a lead indicator of demand in the people-dependent sector.  Attrition, while having dropped, continues to be at a band higher than companies are comfortable with. Most companies have seen attrition reduce to the 17-18 percent range on a trailing 12-month basis.  Over the headcount decline, companies say that they hired ahead of time in previous years, and are currently looking to make their fresh hires productive, utilise the bench strength and upskill existing talent than go out to the market to recruit.  Staffing industry experts had expected negative headcount movement this quarter, and given the lack of visibility on the road ahead in the commentary of IT companies, they do not expect things to get much better in the next two quarters.  Ray Wang, CEO and principal analyst at Constellation Research, told Moneycontrol that attrition not being backfilled has led to headcount being adjusted, but the same is a short-term fix. “Readjustment of skills was needed but we won’t know that until we see the hiring and retention of younger workers with newer skills. That second part is critical in the mid to long term,” he said.  Everest’s Bendor-Samuel said every tech and tech services company over-hired last year, and now that demand has moderated significantly and attrition is down, tech services have large benches. This, he said, is an excellent time for companies to improve quality of talent in organisations and move out lower-performing talent.  “This also comes at a time when the skills that are needed to serve the new digital marketplace are significantly different and hence these firms are also taking the opportunity to rebalance their skills inventory. All that said, we expect growth to continue but at a significantly reduced rate and likely accelerate next year unless we enter a significant recession,” he added.  Promises in generative AI  Amid caution in demand and tepid numbers, generative AI was probably the most used and bankable term during the IT earnings season in Q1. From TCS and Infosys to HCLTech and LTIMindtree, all the companies shared major updates.  Everest Group’s Bendor-Samuel said, “The AI wave which is building is expected to accelerate tech services growth next year and we will likely see growth ranging between 5 and 9 percent provided we do not enter a significant recession. It is too early in the AI wave maturity to expect this to affect revenues in the next two quarters to a significant degree.”  TCS, the country’s largest IT services firm, is working on 50 proof of concepts (PoCs) and has over 100 generative AI deals in its pipeline. It plans to train a talent pool of over 100,000 associates in generative AI. Infosys announced that it has 80 active generative AI projects in the pipeline and has trained 40,000 associates in AI/machine learning skills so far. Some of its recently signed mega-deals and extensions involved deploying generative AI capabilities.  HCLTech has over 140 external and internal generative AI projects at various stages of maturity, from PoCs to implementation. Vijayakumar also told Moneycontrol, that the company will be training around 20,000 associates in generative AI skills over the next 18 months and has set up three global labs.  Wipro is investing $1 billion over the next three years to strengthen its AI capabilities, and is training all its employees.  Despite all the hype and announcements, industry analysts and experts believe that it is still too early for IT companies to start seeing actual significant revenue conversion from generative AI, as most of the projects are still in PoC stages.  Read: Indian IT sector’s Gen AI push is more FOMO than actual revenue conversion: Industry experts  The way forward  According to Bendor-Samuel, the sector is growing but at a significantly reduced rate. He estimated that industry growth has fallen from a high of 13 percent last year to 4 percent this year.  “As we look forward to the rest of the year, we are observing a slight uptick in customer sentiment. At this time it does not appear that this uptick is sufficient to reverse the sentiment away from more for less. However, it does appear that there is a little more available. Hence, we believe that the industry has likely achieved a new normal with growth ranging from 4-6 percent for the rest of the year,” he said.  Bendor-Samuel also highlighted that the new normal of slowing growth in the industry will cause most firms to downgrade guidance like Infosys. Though some firms are better positioned and will have a less dramatic reset, in the case of Infosys they are also dealing with the lumpiness of the mega deal cycle and have also had to do some adjustments for mega deals already signed.  CFOs are in general being cautious as they should be, but they seem to be slightly optimistic for a better fiscal year Q2 and Q3 in general, said Wang.  He said, “As mentioned, the scenario will get better in Q2 (of FY24) as we are close to the end of calendar year contracts. The summer has been slow in general for all the majors. However, there were interesting pockets of growth from companies like Persistent Systems.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/dismal-growth-guidance-downgrades-declining-headcount-how-indian-it-majors-fared-in-q1-11018831.html

infosys,2023-07-21T12:24:01+05:30,Moneycontrol News,IT stocks spiral lower as Infosys sours sentiment,India’s second-largest IT services firm not only missed earnings estimates but also slashed its revenue growth guidance for the current fiscal to 1-3.5 percent from 4-7 percent.,"Information technology stocks were the biggest drags on the market on July 21 after a raft of disappointing numbers from Infosys and other players highlighted the stiff near-term challenges confronting the IT segment.  Infosys plummeted 10 percent in early trade after India’s second-largest IT services firm not only missed earnings estimates but also slashed its revenue growth guidance for the current fiscal to 1-3.5 percent from 4-7 percent.  It cited a challenging macroeconomic environment as the reason behind the cut in guidance.  Follow our live blog for all the market action  The financials  The company reported an 11 percent YoY increase in its net profit to Rs 5,945 crore, while revenue climbed 10 percent to Rs 37,933 crore. Operating margin came in at 20.8 percent, down from last quarter’s 21 percent.  Salil Parekh, CEO and MD of Infosys, said the company is seeing clients either stopping or slowing down transformation programmes and discretionary programmes, particular in financial services, mortgages, hi-tech, telecom, and retail.  Also Read: Infosys nosedives 10% on sharp guidance cut; fuels brokerage downgrades  Analysts' views  He added that deal signings and start dates have been delayed, and a lot of the revenue from the larger and mega deals will be seen only towards the later part of the financial year. A combination of both is why, Parekh said, the company slashed its revenue guidance for the year.  Macquarie downgraded the stock to 'underperform' as it was disappointed by the IT behemoth's deal wins in Q1. The foreign brokerage was also skeptical of Infosys winning a fair share of outcome-oriented managed services deals in the coming quarters.  Nomura was another brokerage that downgraded Infosys to 'reduce' along with a cut of nearly 1 percent in its target price for the stock to Rs 1,210.  JPMorgan, on the other hand, said the sharp guidance cut brings a welcome dose of realism, which should be extended to the valuation of Infosys. The firm expects the miss on net profit and guidance cut to have a bearing on the valuation of Infosys in the short-to-medium term.  IT sector bellwether TCS dropped nearly 2 percent to Rs 3,393.50, while Wipro was trading with cuts of 2.40 percent at Rs 407.30 in afternoon trade.  Last week, TCS reported a 16.8 percent increase in net profit on a year-on-year (YoY) basis in the quarter ended June 30, 2023, driven by a strong growth in total contract value (TCV) deal wins despite a tough business environment.  Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at Rs 59,381 crore, marking an on-year rise of 13 percent. In constant currency terms, the revenue grew by 7 percent YoY.  The numbers were in line with the muted estimates. Sequentially, the country's largest software services exporter grew by a modest 0.4 percent, which is its slowest growth in the last 12 quarters. The net profit declined by 3 percent as against the March quarter.  Wipro had reported an 11.9 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in net profit in the first quarter at Rs 2,870 crore. Sequentially, however, net profit was down by 6.6 percent due to decline in all major financial metrics.  Revenue for the quarter grew 6 percent YoY at Rs 22,831 crore as compared to Rs 21,528 crore in Q1FY23, missing estimates of Rs Rs 23,014 crore.  Mid-Sized Pack  The weak operating environment has weighed on mid-sized IT firms as well.  Mphasis shares slipped nearly 1 percent in early trade after the company’s revenue fell 4.6 percent YoY to Rs 3,252 crore in the quarter ended June, while net profit declined 1.2 percent to Rs 396 crore from Rs 401 crore in Q1 FY23.  The firm said there was a short-term impact on performance due to weakness in banking sector as well as pressure on discretionary spends.  Persistent Systems tumbled more than 4 percent after the Pune-based IT company reported a 9-percent sequential fall in net profit at Rs 228.8 crore for the quarter ended June.  At 11.45 am, the stock was quoting at Rs 4,832.85, down 4.16 percent from the previous close. Trading volumes at 4 lakh shares were slightly above the 1-month average volumes.  Persistent Systems' revenue in rupee terms grew by 3 percent QoQ to Rs 2,321.2 crore and topline in dollar terms also increased by 3 percent to $282.90 million for the quarter. Both the topline and bottomline numbers missed Street estimates.  The EBIT or operating margin declined to 14.9 percent in Q1, missing estimates of flat margins of 15.4 percent reported last quarter. Persistent had earlier said that it expects to improve margins by 200-300 basis points over the next two-three years.  Similarly, Coforge shares dropped 2 percent after the IT firm’s revenue increased 2.4 percent sequentially for the April-June quarter to USD 271.8 million. Coforge saw its revenue grow 2.7 percent in constant currency terms, lower than the expected 3.5 percent sequential growth.  The mid-cap IT services player, however, reported a 43.9-percent jump in its net profit to Rs 165.3 crore, as the company had to provide for an exceptional expense of Rs 52.3 crore in the March quarter.  The company also saw a miss on its operating margins, as it was down 400bps primarily on account of a pickup in hiring, salary hikes, bonus payouts, and visa costs.  As per analysts, the key stumbling block for the entire sector currently is the recessionary headwinds in Europe and US – the bread-and-butter markets for domestic IT players.  “We expect macro-related uncertainty, likely slowdown in tech spends and supply-side pressure to impede growth in the near-term at least in 2 more quarters,” brokerage Ashika said in a recent note.

infosys,2023-07-21T10:07:39+05:30,Abhishek Mukherjee,The Underachievers: These 8 Nifty stocks are yet to join the bull run,"Analysts attribute this underperformance to a host of factors, ranging from a hit to profitability, global headwinds and the most potent reason of them all – because the market so desires.","Despite today's selloff, Dalal Street has consistently surged to record highs in recent sessions, bringing smiles to investors who have been enjoying the benefits of a strong bull run. However, amidst this euphoria, there are still pockets of gloom.  Only eight Nifty50 stocks are trading in the red on a year-to-date basis.  These include two Adani Group companies, India’s largest lender, India’s leading steel maker, India’s second-biggest IT firm, a pharma major, the metals flagship of the Aditya Birla Group, and an agri inputs giant.  Clearly corporate pedigree is no insurance against stock market pain.  Follow our live blog for all the market action  Analysts attribute this underperformance to a host of factors, ranging from a hit to profitability due to operational challenges to global headwinds and the most potent reason of them all – because the market so desires.  “If we leave the Adani stocks aside, the remaining are facing company-specific issues like challenging operative environment, price pressures etc. For SBI, there’s no particular problem on the company side, but we must remember the stock had a good run over the previous 2-year period, so it can be viewed as a time correction,” Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, told Moneycontrol.  “All in all, the fact that we have just eight underperformers itself shows the health and breadth of this bull run,” he added.  &amp;nbsp;    &amp;nbsp;  The biggest laggards on the list are the Hindenburg-mauled Adani Group’s firms Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd.  While most Adani firms have rebounded from the lows triggered by the damning report of US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research, they are still some distance away from their 52-week highs.  For example, Adani Enterprises is trading 70 percent below its 52-week high of Rs 4,189.55, while Adani Ports still needs to climb 35 percent to reach its 52-week peak of Rs 987.90.  In the case of agri solutions company UPL, the share prices nosedived after its fourth quarter numbers were pummelled by a rapid decline in post-patent product prices as China’s post-Covid reopening led to an oversupply of agri chemicals.  Most analysts anticipate the company’s operational performance to remain subdued at least in the first half of FY24.  Global macro headwinds have claimed three more prominent victims – Hindalco, Tata Steel and Infosys.  Metals and mining giant Hindalco, which soared to its 52-week high in January this year, has been trending downward since then, weighed by the muted performance of its US-based subsidiary Novelis, lacklustre global demand environment as well as shutdown of a copper plant for maintenance.  Tata Steel too suffered from weak demand across geographies and elevated input costs (mainly coking coal). However, robust steel demand in India and declining trend in raw material prices have kept the Street largely optimistic about the company’s prospects.  No such luck for Infosys, which is bearing the brunt of global tightening of IT budgets due to the slowdown in the EU and US – the bread-and-butter markets for India’s software service players.  A string of high-profile exits over the past few months has further stoked fears over the company’s leadership attrition and near-term roadmap.  Infosys has the most ‘sell’ ratings in this list as well as the steepest decline in the number of ‘buy’ calls compared to January 2023.    Infosys on July 20 posted an 11 percent increase in its net profit to Rs 5,945 crore, missing market expectations.  However, what came as a shocker was its revenue growth guidance for the current fiscal being slashed to 1-3.5 percent from 4-7 percent, triggering a rout in the company’s American Depository Receipts (ADRs) as well as domestic shares.  So severe has been the selling in Infosys this morning that the stock almost single-handedly prevented the Nifty from scaling the historic 20,000-mark which market participants were eagerly looking forward to.  Also Read: Infosys nosedives 10% on sharp guidance cut; fuels brokerage downgrades  Pharma company Cipla has the second highest number of ‘sell’ ratings, with the Street fretting over delays in potential launches in the key market of North America, regulatory risks and limited upside from current levels.  Cipla shares went into a tailspin in February after the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) issued 8 observations for its Pithampur manufacturing facility. The company had said it would address the matter ‘within stipulated time.’  &amp;nbsp;  SBI is a bit of an anomaly in this list as the Street view is largely positive for the banking behemoth, despite the ‘government discount’ most PSU stocks suffer from.  Notably, the entire banking sector is thriving at this time, and public sector lenders collectively posted a record net profit of Rs 1.05 lakh crore in FY23, with SBI and others reporting their highest-ever earnings amid a steady decline in bad assets and healthy loan demand.  Of course, SBI is only marginally lower at this point and may well find itself out of this list by the time it announces its Q1 FY24 results amid expectations of another set of strong numbers.  Which means more wind beneath the wings of the current rally. And not to forget, wider smiles.

infosys,2023-07-21T09:01:02+05:30,Santosh Nair,"Short call | The case for a contrarian view on Infosys, China stimulus, US recession","Infosys will be in the eye of a storm again today following the sharp cut in its revenue guidance for the current year.  However, steep corrections in Infosys have provided short-term trading opportunities.","Experience teaches us that earnings estimates, especially those of a longer-term nature, are not particularly reliable. ~Arthur Zeikel  For a company that used to be known for beating analysts' estimates comfortably, Infosys also holds the dubious distinction of a double-digit fall in stock price whenever the quarterly earnings/guidance have fallen short of market expectations. In April 2003, the stock had crashed 32 percent in a single trading session on weak fourth-quarter earnings and a profit warning. Then in April 2013, the stock tanked 21 percent in a single trading session, again because of a weak quarter and cautious guidance. In October 2019, the stock crashed 17 percent in a single session following a whistle-blower complaint accusing the two senior executives of unethical practices to boost short-term profits. And just three months back, the stock had collapsed over 12 percent after disappointing with its quarterly numbers and guidance.  In some of the instances when the stock crashed, the issues had more to do with the company than the business environment. And yet each time, investors who bought the stock during a panic were better over the next couple of years. If nothing else, steep corrections in Infosys have provided short-term trading opportunities.  Infosys will be in the eye of a storm again today following the sharp cut in its revenue guidance for the current year. Not surprisingly, its latest performance has been greeted with a flurry of negative broker ratings and a cut in earnings estimates. A steep fall in the stock price looks very much on the cards. So Short Call has chosen to focus on the handful of analysts who feel that the stock may still be a good bet.  Broking firm HSBC has maintained its buy rating on Infosys with a price target of Rs 1,540. And what makes HSBC analysts Yogesh Aggarwal and Abhishek Pathak bullish? For one, they feel the market may be getting unduly pessimistic.  “We believe guidance of 7 percent growth was unrealistic, but now the pendulum has moved to the other extreme. The lower end of the guidance (1 percent) now means a nearly flat (-0.3 percent) CQGR for the next three quarters. This would mean at the lower end Infosys revenues would be flat for nearly six quarters (starting 3Q23). This seems quite pessimistic, especially when the US economy seems to be stabilising,” the duo wrote in their note.  Similarly, Jefferies too has maintained its bullish view on the stock with a price target of Rs 1,550, despite a view that some of the problems could be company specific, especially in its banking vertical. Analysts Akshat Agarwal and Ankur Pant have pointed out that the first quarter performance was better than peers and margins were stable.  What is the argument for the bull run?  “Infosys' new guidance leaves limited earnings risks in our view. The guidance implies a 0.2-1.8 percent CQGR (Compounded quarterly growth rate) over the rest of FY24 which seems reasonable and is unlikely to disappoint,” write Agarwal and Pant. If the stock falls around 10 percent on Friday, then it would be available at 19 times estimated FY25 earnings, which according to the duo is not a bad deal because the valuation would be in line with its 10-yr average and 13 percent below its 5-year average—both not expensive.  “With the stock available at below avg. PE on realistic earnings, we maintain buy,” says the note.  Copper light  Goldman Sachs &amp;amp; Consultancy CRU Group have trimmed forecasts for copper usage in electric vehicles as they now expect improvements in EV design and efficiency to reduce copper content per vehicle, reports oilprice.com. The CRU Group now predicts that the average EV will use between 51-56 kilograms of copper from this year on against the previous estimate of 65-66 kilograms, reports mining.com. Goldman Sachs has slashed its estimate to 65 kilos of copper vehicle from 73 kilos earlier. Why does this matter? Because EV components remain one of the primary copper uses.  Robust housing  The much talked about recession may have already come and gone, as far as the US housing market is concerned. Builders are sounding less downbeat than they were a year ago, and the National Association of Home Builders index of industry sentiment rose to 56 in July from 55 a month earlier, reports WSJ. The latest reading is still depressed, but it is the highest since June 2022 and a significant improvement from the low of 31 recorded in December.  Business booster  Investors looking for good news from China have something to cheer about, though it may not yet be time to uncork the bubbly. China’s economic planner said Thursday that two new policies for supporting non-state-owned businesses will be launched soon, reports CNBC. The eagerly awaited demand boost from China reopening has turned out to be a damp squib. If anything, the weakness in its economy has prompted China to dump certain commodities in global markets as it tries to clear inventory. Business sentiment is generally downbeat, but a long-standing debt overhang, among other issues, has made Beijing reluctant to embark on large-scale stimulus.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/short-call-the-case-for-a-contrarian-view-on-infosys-china-stimulus-us-recession-10999371.html

infosys,2023-07-21T08:03:23+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Morning Scan: All the big stories to get you started for the day,A round-up of top newspaper stories to keep you ahead of others,"#1. Bulls push Indian markets to fresh highs, Nifty just short of 20,000 points  Equity benchmarks in India have extended their record-breaking run to the sixth consecutive trading day as foreign funds heightened local purchases. The Nifty scaled a new high of 19,991.85 points, ending at 19,979.15, up 0.74 percent. The Sensex closed at 67,571.90 points, up 0.71 percent. Since the lows of March, foreign investors have pumped in over Rs 85,000 crore, causing the benchmark gauges to surge 18 percent in the past four months, handily outperforming global peers.  Why it’s important: The stock markets seem to be getting overheated and overbought after the recent upsurge, but money managers are still unwilling to bet against the bullish momentum.  #2. Infosys misses first quarter profits estimates, pares forecast for 2023-24  Infosys has reported its weakest June quarter revenue growth since 2020-21 and cut its annual sales forecast for the current financial year. The IT bellwether said revenue rose 1 percent in constant currency terms from the preceding three months and 4.2 percent a year earlier to reach Rs 37,933 crore. Net profit rose 10.9 percent to Rs 5,945 crore and operating margin was 20.8 percent, in line with its guidance.  Why it’s important: Global headwinds have started slowing sown growth of India’s software services companies as companies in the key western market tighten belts. A difficult year lies ahead.  #3. Hindustan Unilever posts 8 percent rise in profits as consumer sentiment improves  Profits at Hindustan Unilever rose 8 percent in the June quarter and sales increased 7 percent amid a gradual recovery in demand on a lower base. Quarterly sales at Unilever’s India unit rose to Rs 14,931 crore from Rs 14,016 crore a year ago, while net profit grew to Rs 2,472 crore from Rs 2,289 crore a year earlier. Volumes rose 3 percent in the fiscal first quarter and expansion in the coming quarters will be driven by higher offtake of products rather than price hikes, the firm said.  Why it’s important: The good performance of India’s largest consumer goods company, considered a proxy for broader consumer sentiment in the country, augurs well. Softening inflation is intensifying competition though, especially from smaller regional firms.  #4. Jio Financial Services emerges as third most valued shadow bank in India  Jio Financial Services, a unit of Reliance Industries, has been valued at Rs 1.66 lakh crore following an hour-long special trading session. Jio Financial’s price at Rs 261.85 apiece was higher than analysts’ expectations. At current valuations, it will be India’s 33rd most valuable company and the third-biggest non-banking financial company behind Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv.  Why it’s important: The discovered prices of Jio Financial is higher than parent Reliance industries, underscoring the robust outlook of India’s financial services sector. Mukesh Ambani has delivered a winner even before the firm has started operations.  #5. Media tycoon Subash Chandra in talks to buyback family stake in Dish TV  Subhash Chandra is in discussions with JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Company to buyback his family’s shares in Dish TV India, marking another twist in the two-year-old battle between the minority investor and the promoter for control of India’s third-largest satellite TV operator. He has also proposed to buy other assets, including shares in Zee Learn and three properties, willing to pay JC Flowers Rs 1,500 crore.  Why it’s important: There seems to be no end to the battle for control in Dish TV. It comes at a time when streaming services are stealing a march over satellite TV operators.  #6. Auditor Deloitte’s report raised flags over Byju’s financial controls  Byju’s former statutory auditor Deloitte had in a June regulatory filing signaled concerns over alleged weaknesses in internal financial controls within Think &amp;amp; Learn, the company that runs the edtech unicorn, according to documents filed with the registrar of companies. Deloitte adversely opined that the firm has not maintained adequate and effective internal controls over financial reporting.  Why it’s important: The corporate affairs ministry is probing alleged irregularities in India’s most valuable start-up. Byju’s is in full damage control mode but it’s unclear if it can sail past its troubles.  #7. High court arbitrator rejects Max Healthcare’s claims on Care Hospital  Max Healthcare Institute’s petition seeking to prevent the sale of TPG-backed Care Hospitals to Blackstone has been dismissed by an arbitrator. Blackstone signed a share-purchase agreement in May to buy a majority stake in Care Hospitals for around $700 million for a 70 percent stake. The deal is awaiting regulatory approvals.  Why it’s important: Attempts by Max Healthcare to scuttle the deal has failed and if it does not appeal the decision, the way would be clear for the acquisition to fructify. The excellent prospects of private healthcare in India have made it a prize worth fighting over.  #8. REC to sign pacts worth Rs 2 lakh crore with 20 renewables companies  REC, one of the biggest lenders to the country’s power sector, is planning to sign agreements worth Rs 2 lakh crore with close to 20 renewable energy companies in both the public and private sectors to fund their energy transition projects. These include solar, wind power, green hydrogen, decarbonization, and battery storage.  Why it’s important: The move is aiming to green up REC’s portfolio as the energy transition gathers pace in India. The state-owned firm has till now backed mainly conventional power firms.  #9. GST authorities to complete tax evasion probe against insurers by end of November  The Directorate General of GST Intelligence will complete its probe into 30 insurance companies by November. It has already completed the investigation into 15 of them, detecting input tax credit discrepancies to the tune of Rs 3,500 crore. It is in the process of sending notices to the remaining 15. Most of the tax due in the cases where the probe is complete has been recovered.  Why it’s important: Insurers had claimed input tax credit through fake invoices from intermediaries and agents without receiving any services. Recoveries will deter further violation of norms.  #10. Celebrities start investing heavily in consumer-facing start-ups in India  At a time when private equity and venture capital investments in large Indian startups have hit a four-year low, Bollywood and sports stars have emerged as another set of investors doubling down on emerging startups and direct-to-consumer brands. Babycare brand SuperBottoms has Alia Bhatt as its investor. Parineeti Chopra acquired a minority stake in personal care brand Clensta, former cricketer Sourav Ganguly has picked up a stake in food delivery startup JustMyRoots, and Suniel Shetty has invested in do-it-yourself healthcare venture the Biohacker.  Why it’s important: The latest trend of celebrity investments is expected to continue. The stars are expecting that the strategic investments into start-ups would pay off in many multiples in the long term.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Also read: Infosys Results Q1FY24 Live: CEO Salil Parekh says had a very strong Q1; operating margin was strong at 20.8%  He added that deal signings and start dates have been delayed, and a lot of the revenue from the larger and mega deals will be seen only towards the later part of the financial year. A combination of both is why, Parekh said, the company slashed its revenue guidance for the year.  Revenue guidance  In an interaction with Morgan Stanley in early June, the company had expressed confidence about meeting the lower end of the 4-7 percent revenue growth in constant currency terms in FY24. Even then, it had said that achieving the higher end of that band would be difficult unless some of the high-end deals closed at a faster pace.  Infosys has slashed its revenue guidance but maintained its operating margin guidance at 20-22 percent.  In Q1FY24, the company reported a 11 percent increase YoY in its net profit to Rs 5,945 crore. The number missed miss market expectations.  Its consolidated revenue increased 10 percent YoY to Rs 37,933 crore, while its operating margin came in at 20.8 percent, down from last quarter’s 21 percent.  The company saw disappointing numbers in the previous quarter too.  While the IT major had affirmed a revenue growth guidance in constant currency at 16-16.5 percent at the end of last quarter, it posted a full-year revenue growth of 15.4 percent. Sequentially, revenue for the quarter declined 2.2 percent in reported terms, and fell 3.2 percent in constant currency terms, coming in at $4,554 million",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/infosys-adr-opens-9-7-percent-lower-on-nasdaq-on-weak-revenue-guidance-10996931.html

","Infosys may have grown ahead of its peers in constant currency terms where it grew at 1 percent for the quarter, but the shocker is its guidance for the year, which was a drastic cut from 4-7 percent to 1-3.5 percent, signalling tough times ahead.  Speaking to the press, Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh said that while the company has reported large and mega deals in Q1, they are seeing signings and start dates being pushed.  “With that, we see a lot of that revenue from large and mega deals towards the later part of the financial year. Through the quarter, we've seen volumes in some of our clients in the industries (such as financial services, retail and hi-tech) were impacted where they are reducing transformation projects or slowing down decision making,” Parekh said. It was a combination of both, he said, that led to the guidance being lowered depending on the macro environment.  Wide impact  In the short term, Parekh said they see clients stopping or slowing down transformation programs and discretionary works — particularly in financial services in mortgages, asset management, investment banking and payments, and in telecom. “We also see some impact in the hi-tech industry and in parts of retail,” he said.  Also read: Infosys slashes FY24 revenue guidance to 1-3.5%, profit increases 11% YoY  In the meeting with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy said the decline in guidance, among other reasons was due to lower-than-expected volumes and lower mega deals in discretionary areas.  He said that at the previous guidance, the upper end of the guidance had a larger amount of mega deals and the lower band was based on base volume, which would primarily be seen in the first and second quarters. “We’ve seen discretionary spend cuts here and that softness extends into Q2 as well,” he said.  For the lower end of the guidance of 1 percent, Parekh told analysts that the approach is focused on what the company has seen “in terms of volumes, discretionary projects in Q1 and overlay of mega and large deals we’ve won and estimate we’re looking at.”  “Some start dates have moved out, volume and discretionary projects slowing is in quarter… we saw the 1 percent in terms of the lower end of the guidance when we combine that,” he said.  Also read: Infosys headcount shrinks by 6,940 in Q1FY24, employee count declines for second consecutive quarter  Parekh maintained that there is still a good pipeline of large deals and that there is work in cost takeout, efficiency and automation in consolidation.  Infosys posted a disappointing set of numbers in Q4Fy23 and had missed its guidance for the previous year too -- at the time over a one-time impact of a project cancellation as well as deferrals and rampdowns. The IT major said that things had started looking up in March, but the demand environment going forward was uncertain. Green shoots are yet to be visible, despite the company saying that the pipeline is healthy.  In the last two quarters, Parekh has called out softness in parts of hi-tech, retail and telecom as well as parts of financial services such as asset management, investment banking and mortgage.  New deals  Its large deal TCV is up from last quarter’s $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. In the same time period last year, it had a TCV of $1.7 billion.  During the quarter, Infosys made announcements of two mega deals as well as updated the exchanges about the spend for an existing client. The company signed an MoU with British multinational BP for a deal pegged at $1.5 billion, and another with Danske Bank of $454 million (which could be ramped up to $900 million). Earlier this week, Infosys informed the exchanges that it entered into an agreement with an existing client to provide AI and automation-led development, modernisation and maintenance services, where the spend would be $2 billion over five years.  Analysts earlier told Moneycontrol that the growth of the industry will drop with the mix of deals considerably skewed towards cost-saving and self-funded modernisation, but that there is a significant pipeline for these deals.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/delays-in-decision-making-clients-cutting-back-on-spends-why-infosys-sees-a-bleak-year-ahead-10996841.html

With this, the company’s headcount stands at 3,36,294. HCLTech and Wipro also saw their headcounts fall sequentially this quarter.  TCS added 523 employees on a net basis to its headcount, while HCLTech’s employee count shrunk by 2,506 and crosstown rival Wipro’s by 8,812.  Talent market cooling off  Hiring is an indicator of demand and as demand has fallen, companies across the industry look to utilise the bench strength they have built and increase utilisation, rather than hiring ahead of time.  Hiring numbers were not expected to be significant across companies. In Infosys’ case, net addition fell steeply in each quarter of the last fiscal year. The company added 21,171 employees on a net basis in Q1FY23, 10,032 in Q2, and 1,627 in Q3, before going into the red in Q4.  Attrition for the quarter continued its downward trend and came in at 17.3 percent, from last quarter’s 20.9 percent on a trailing-twelve-month basis. As the talent market cools off, attrition rates have continued to normalise further.  The company did not share any hiring plans, particularly in terms of freshers, for FY24. &quot;As freshers start getting deployed, we will calibrate the hiring for FY24 based on the available pool of employees, growth expectations and attrition trends,&quot; Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy told analysts last quarter.  The financials  The company’s utilisation also declined to 80 percent in Q4FY23, something it hoped would improve in subsequent quarters. In Q1, utilisation stood at 81.1 percent, excluding trainees.

infosys,2023-07-20T09:57:47+05:30,Bloomberg,A $46 billion rally shows India tech woes easing,"The newfound optimism marks a change from just months ago, when Infosys warned about customers in key sectors such as finance pulling back amid fear of recession in the US and Europe","Optimism is returning for India’s information-technology companies as easing odds of a recession in the US and the emergence of artificial intelligence as a potential new source of revenue drive a rebound in their stocks.  The NSE Nifty IT Index has climbed 18% from an April low, adding about $46 billion in market value. The 10-member gauge has turned the rally up a notch in July, and is on track to outperform the MSCI World Information Technology Index for the first time in seven months.   Indian IT Stocks Have Caught Back Up With Nifty Rally  Gains picked up after Asia’s biggest software services exporter Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. last week reported better-than-expected profits for the latest quarter. Its shares climbed, along with those of peers including Infosys Ltd., which is scheduled to report today.  The rebound in tech shares has put them back on track with the broader rally in Indian stocks as investors target sectors that lagged and are available at cheaper valuations. The Nifty IT gauge is trading at about 23 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months, up from about 20 times in April but still below its all-time high of 32 times.  While TCS said some clients are delaying spending, the profit beat helped dispel concerns over the impact of economic slowdowns on global customers that plagued the industry earlier this year. The company and peers that have already reported also provided reassurance over profitable offerings in automation and other emerging technology.  “The flavor of the quarter was generative AI,” Tata Consultancy CEO K. Krithivasan said on the company’s earnings call last week. “In every conversation I have had with clients over the last three months, this has unfailingly come up.”  The newfound optimism marks a change from just months ago, when Infosys warned about customers in key sectors such as finance pulling back amid fear of recession in the US and Europe, the biggest markets for Indian IT firms. Instability in the global banking system in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse compounded those concerns.  The selloff in software exporters earlier in the year was due to lower volumes of discretionary projects in the US, but June quarter performance has not been as bad as feared, said Patricia Urbano, a Paris-based fund manager with Edmond de Rothschild. AI could be better for the sector than had been expected, she added.   India IT Gauge Beating World Peer First Time Since December  Profits at Wipro Ltd. actually came in slightly below consensus estimates but margins were seen as steady, and the firm announced a $1 billion plan to boost its AI business. Concerns are not completely out of the way for the sector, however, as evidenced by a spike in short positioning in shares of Infosys ahead of its results.  While estimated 12-month forward earnings for the Nifty IT index have dipped this month to about 1,350 rupees per share, they remain above the April low of around 1,330 rupees per share and 1,270 at the start of the year. The sector’s solid profitability and efforts to reward shareholders have helped lure investors back.  The software exporters are “returning capital to investors with lots of dividends and buybacks,” according to Mark Matthews, head of Asia-Pacific research at Bank Julius Baer &amp;amp; Co. “It was a good correction to enter the space.”  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/a-46-billion-rally-shows-india-tech-woes-easing-10992551.html

The Bengaluru-headquartered company is likely to report a net profit of Rs 6,098 crore, representing a 13.76 percent jump YoY, as per the average of a poll of estimates of five brokerages.  Infosys had posted a net profit of Rs 5,360 crore in the first quarter of the preceding fiscal FY23.  However, when compared sequentially, company’s net profit is seen contracting by 0.49 percent as against Rs 6,128 crore in Q4 FY23.  Also Read: Infosys bags five-year deal pegged at $2bn with existing client  Revenue is estimated to grow 9.30 percent to Rs 37,675 crore from Rs 34,470 crore in Q1 FY23. The company’s consolidated revenue stood at Rs 37,441 crore in the preceding quarter Q4 FY23.  “We expect revenue to decline by 0.5 percent QoQ (constant currency) due to cancellations, project ramp-downs, and slower decision cycles. We expect a 20bps QoQ contraction in EBIT margin due to revenue decline. Large deal wins to benefit from the $454 million Danske Bank deal and also possibly from the announced MoU with BP,” foreign brokerage Jefferies said in a note.  The domestic IT sector is bearing the brunt of global tightening of IT budgets, project cancellations, delays in decision-making process and reduction in small-scale and time-sensitive deals.  Headwinds Ahead?  Kotak Institutional Equities said Infosys’ large order wins and deal pipeline will be closely monitored.  “Large deals will be in focus. Quantum of pipe, nature of large deals, pace of decision making and drivers of consolidation trend will be important focus points. We expect healthy TCV (total contract value) of wins powered by large deals,” it added.  Infosys had posted EBIT margins of 21 percent in Q4FY23, which is seen under pressure.  “We expect 30 bps qoq decline in EBIT margin. Headwinds in the quarter are in the form of higher variable compensation leading to 100 bps impact. Provision for post sales client support (as opposed to reversal) is another 30 bps headwind. Tailwind is largely in the form of normalization after 90 bps impact in 4QFY23 due to revenue reversals,” it added.  However, Kotak expects Infosys to tighten revenue guidance band to 4-6 percent from 4-7 percent band earlier.  Analysts say the macro headwinds are expected to weigh on the IT pack for the next few quarters.  In a note to clients, domestic brokerage Ashika said Infosys is likely to report muted revenue growth in the range of 0.5-1 percent in both rupee and dollar terms.  The key stumbling block for the entire sector currently is the recessionary headwinds in Europe and US – the bread-and-butter markets for domestic IT players.  “We expect macro-related uncertainty, likely slowdown in tech spends and supply-side pressure to impede growth in the near-term at least in 2 more quarters,” Ashika added.  In this context, key focus during the Q1 results announcement would be on demand commentary and large deal wins.  The Infosys stock had faced a barrage of rating downgrades after the Q4FY23 results. It is down 3 percent on YTD basis, though the 1-month return stands at 13 percent.

This indicates there can be a possible consolidation or minor correction in the coming days especially due to the recent upward rally after a breakout of the 19,500-19,300 range on the higher side. Even the volatility also increased for yet another session, with the India VIX moving towards the 12 mark.  The BSE Sensex rose more than 200 points to 66,795, while the Nifty50 climbed 38 points to 19,749 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts as the closing was lower than opening levels but there was a continuation of higher tops, higher bottoms formation.

Asian Paints, which remained in an upward rally since April, rose 1.5 percent to settle at Rs 3,513, the highest closing level since September 28 last year and is a few rupees away from its all-time high of Rs 3,590 on January 10 last year. The stock has formed a bullish candlestick pattern on the daily scale with above-average volumes and maintained higher highs, higher lows formation for six days in a row.  Birlasoft sustained an uptrend with higher volumes for the fourth consecutive session, rising over 2 percent to Rs 392 on Tuesday, the highest closing level since May 6 last year. The stock has formed a bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, with staying above 50-day as well as 200-day EMAs.  Here's what Viraj Vyas of Ashika Stock Broking recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Infosys  Infosys has seen a strong rally from April's lows of Rs 1,200. However, on a broader time frame, the stock is still undergoing time and price correction.  It is currently approaching a resistance area formed by recent swing highs. If the stock can break above Rs 1,480-1,500 zone on a weekly basis, it could signal further bullish momentum for the stock.    Asian Paints  Asian Paints has been consolidating since September 2021, correcting over time. Recently, it found support at the swing low and rebounded strongly, reaching the upper threshold of the consolidation.  The weekly chart shows a breakthrough above resistance at Rs 3,400-3,440, indicating renewed bullish momentum. The stock is poised to target Rs 4,000-4,100 zone, with critical support at Rs 3,375.    Birlasoft  Birlasoft has been establishing a solid foundation within Rs 340-260 range for approximately a year. Recently, the stock successfully breached the Rs 340-level with increased trading volumes.  Notably, it has exhibited higher highs and higher lows on daily charts, suggesting a possible trend reversal. If the stock sustains above Rs 370, there is a strong probability of it advancing towards Rs 440-450 levels in the forthcoming weeks.

According to Mostaque, as reported by the business news website, the influence of this AI trend will vary, and not everyone will experience the same level of impact.  The website quoted Mostaque as saying on India, “Outsourced coders up to level three programmers will be gone in the next year or two...&quot;  Quoting Mostaque, who was speaking about coders in a general context, the report said, &quot;Why would you have to write code where the computer can write code better? When you deconstruct the programming thing from bug testing to unit testing to ideation, an AI can do that, just better.”  “But it won’t be doing it automatically, it will be AI ‘co-pilots,’” Mostaque said. “That means less people are needed for classical programming, but then are they needed for other things? This is the question and this is the balance that we have to understand, because different areas are also affected differently.”  According to a Bloomberg report, India is home to more than 5 million software programmers.

Earlier this month, it announced its plan to get 25,000 employees trained in Microsoft's Azure Open AI to help clients accelerate their adoption of this new technology.

In 2021, Sudha Murty, chairperson of Infosys Foundation, committed more than Rs 100 crore toward Covid relief efforts.  Murty, one of India's richest women, recently said that for her, money is &quot;not that important&quot;, entrepreneurship is.  Speaking to Moneycontrol at its Startup Conclave in Bengaluru, the author and philanthropist said, &quot;I never aimed for money. For me, money is not that important. The creation of jobs, creation of wealth can uplift people who are below the poverty line, and for that entrepreneurship is very important.&quot;  Interestingly, in an earlier interview with Moneycontrol, Sudha Murty had also shared that Infosys, which today has a market capitalisation of around $80 billion, started with a loan of Rs 10,000 that she gave Narayana Murthy in 1981. Murty revealed that the money came from her personal emergency fund, saved up over the years without her husband’s knowledge.  “My mother told me when I was married, you know, you should always keep some money. And this money should be used only in an emergency, not to buy sari, not to buy gold or anything,” she said. Following her mother’s advice, every month, Murty would save a small portion of her and her husband’s salary without his knowledge.  In 1981, the emergency fund amounted to Rs 10,250. It helped turn Murty into an “angel investor” in what would go on to become Infosys -- one of the world’s largest IT companies.

The index was trading 0.29 percent up at 31,036.75 at 1.50 pm, after touching its 52-week high of 31,658.10 earlier in the session.  Since touching its 52-week low of 26,184 on April 17, the index has climbed nearly 5,500 points.  Wipro was the top gainer in the index, jumping around 3 percent, despite the IT major last week posting a lower-than-expected bottomline for the April-June period.  The IT services company reported a net profit of Rs 2,870 crore in the first quarter after market hours on July 13. Though the bottomline was up around 12 percent on year, it fell 6.6 percent on a sequential basis, largely due to a decline across all major financial metrics. Moreover, the net profit for the quarter under review also lagged the Street's estimate of Rs 2,976 crore.  Catch all the market action on our live blog  On a year-to-date basis, the Nifty IT index is now trading with gains of over 10 percent, led by midcap IT names like Persistent Systems and Coforge, which have surged by nearly 30 percent each, while shares of Tech Mahindra, and LTIMindtree have gained over 20 percent each. Infosys is the only stock on the index now which is trading with losses on a year-to-date basis, although even that stock has recovered most of its losses.  Siddharth Bhamre, Research Head, Religare Broking, said he is bullish on the information technology (IT) sector, which is not finding too many takers right now because of the cautious view on the United States economy. And the latest quarterly numbers seem to bear that out.

This development comes as the country’s third largest IT services firm is facing a tough business environment and reported weak June quarter performance this week.  Speaking to analysts during the company’s earnings conference, CEO and MD, C Vijayakumar said, “This year, we have made a decision to skip the compensation review, starting with the management layer, which is E4+, and also defer for junior to mid-level people by a quarter, which is E3 and below levels.&quot;  According to CFO Prateek Aggarwal, the E4+ layer which includes the senior most staff, also forms a significant portion of the company’s wage bill.  Regarding junior to mid-level staff, Chief People Officer Ramachandran Sundararajan said, “Typically, this time of the year, we make our announcements on pay reviews. Last couple of years the hiring that we have done and the compensation reviews that we have done, we have taken that into consideration and have taken a decision to defer our annual reviews by a quarter.”  HCLTech reported big misses on several counts in Q1FY24, against analyst estimates. One of the key metric missed was the EBIT margin which fell to 16.9 percent in Q1, down from 18.2 percent in the previous quarter. Aggarwal added that nearly 36 bps of fall in the margins were driven by lower utilisation rates in Q1.  The company also reported a decline of 2,506 employees in its total headcount in Q1, while choosing not to back fill attrition.  Improving utilisation rates will be a key component to ensure improvement in operating margins which will eventually help the company achieve its guidance of exiting FY24 with an 18-19 percent margin, Vijayakumar told Moneycontrol during an interview.  Not just HCLTech, peers Infosys and Wipro too are delaying pay hikes. As of now Wipro is holding up its wage hike cycle until the third quarter or the December quarter, unlike last fiscal when hikes were rolled out in the September quarter.  Wipro will also be paying out only 80 percent of the variable pay to its junior level employees in Q1, which is linked to the company’s overall performance.  Infosys too has deferred pay hikes, which is generally rolled out to employee levels below the senior management in April and to the senior management in July. Employees of both of these segments didn't received any communication from the company on these delays.  Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) turned out be an outlier this time as it has already kick started its promotion cycle, having offered 12-15 percent hikes to its exceptional performers effective from April 1. TCS, however, has deferred onboarding of over 200 lateral hires with two to 15 years of experience until October citing uncertainty and delays in project commencement.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hcltech-skips-salary-hikes-for-management-level-staff-in-fy24-10960151.html

There also wasn’t much clarity on client spending in the immediate months.,"Wipro continues to be impacted by macro challenges which are weighing on its growth. In line with its commentary from last quarter, Chief Executive Officer Thierry Delaporte said that the market has remained largely unchanged — with discretionary spends being impacted and clients focusing on cost efficiency and vendor consolidation.  When it comes to verticals, the company has seen a decline of 4.3 percent QoQ in CC terms in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) vertical, 3.5 percent in Consumer, 1.3 percent in health, 4.9 percent in in energy, natural resources and utilities, and 0.5 percent in Communications.  The technology vertical, however, grew 0.1 percent, and manufacturing at 0.9 percent.  Wipro's bookings for the quarter stood at $3.7 billion, falling sequentially from last quarter’s $4.17 billion. However, its large deal TCV came in at $1.2 billion, marginally higher than last quarter’s $1.08 billion.  ALSO READ: Wipro sees headcount decline for the third consecutive quarter, ends Q1FY24 with 8,812 fewer employees  As the number of its active customers declined by 35 from last quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jatin Dalal said that the company is pivoting its business from doing tiny amounts of work for a small customer to doing “more value-added work for strategic customers,” adding that the software provider had six more customers in the $20 million deal band and two more in the $100 million-plus deal band.  “...We are closing more large deals than we used to before. But at the same time, there is a reduction in discretionary spends, smaller engagements, for one quarter for two,” he said while adding that large programs are not ending and that relationships haven’t ended.  “Frankly, it's really more a direct consequence of the spending pattern of our clients,” Dalal said.  He added that the company’s revenue guidance of -2 percent to 1 percent for the next quarter takes into account the fact that the market could evolve in either direction.  Demand environment  Delaporte said Wipro is witnessing tech investment normalise after the sharp acceleration in spending during the pandemic.  “More and more clients are expecting faster returns on investments and optimising cost through increased use of automation and vendor consolidation. In parallel, we continue to see solid demand in high growth areas like cloud, mostly around cloud transformation,” he said.  He, however, maintained that a lot of smaller discretionary spending has either been postponed or stopped. There also isn’t much clarity on client spending in the immediate months.  &quot;For the time being, I continue to see more or less the same market that we saw a quarter ago,” he said but added that large and mega deals are in the pipeline.  “Typically, we have more of these deals in our pipe than we had two or three years ago. There are not necessarily only focusing on cost takeout, but certainly there is an expectation to drive productivity and efficiency,” Delaporte said.  Consulting business  The company has spent $2.3 billion in acquisitions since the time Delaporte took over as CEO in 2020. Capco ($1.45 billion) and Rizing are among Wipro's biggest deals.  Delaporte maintained that the consulting expertise they provide is “critical”, and the acquisitions were made “completely consciously knowing that the consulting business is by definition a market that is growing fast in a growth market and slowing down in a slowing market,” he concluded.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/clients-expecting-faster-roi-smaller-discretionary-spends-postponed-or-stopped-wipro-ceo-delaporte-10955521.html
infosys,2023-07-12T08:48:56+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,MC Exclusive: Infosys defers pay hikes for employees,"The IT major usually rolls out hikes for employees below the senior management level in the June quarter, but employees have not received any communication so far. ","India’s second-largest IT services company Infosys has deferred the salary hikes that it typically rolls out from April for its employees below the senior management level, Moneycontrol has learnt. This comes as another indicator of the stress companies are under in the current macroeconomic climate as they see projects that are ramped down or cancelled.  Multiple employees in the know have confirmed that they have not received their pay raises that used to come in the June quarter (Q1). They have also received no intimation on the delay or when they are likely to receive their pay increases.  The company also rolls out hikes for its senior management in July, but so far they too haven’t received any communication on the same. It could not be ascertained at the time of publishing if their hikes too have been deferred.  Infosys previously froze hikes in the pandemic year of 2020 due to cash conservation, and then rolled out hikes in January 2021.  Queries sent to the company went unanswered at the time of publishing, and this story will be updated if the company responds.  Infosys is due to report its numbers for the first quarter of the fiscal on July 20, with the quarter expected to be subdued. For the full year, the IT major has guided for revenue growth of 4-7 percent in FY24, marking the first time since FY18 when the company’s revenue will be in this guided range.  In the fourth quarter of FY23, the company reduced its variable payout on average to 60 percent across the organisation. While the average payout was 60 percent, an employee’s final variable payout will depend on their unit or department’s guidelines, and varies for different pay grades and departments.  An email sent to employees at the time said the fourth quarter was impacted by a volatile market and unseen events. “As we remain vigilant to the changes in the market, we must also see this as an opportunity to rally as a group and remain committed to navigating the changing business landscape,” the email sent to employees at the time read.  &quot;While FY23 was a year of strong performance overall, the quarter that went by was impacted by a volatile market and unforeseen events,” an email sent to employees, as seen by Moneycontrol, said.  In the company’s Annual General Meeting last month, Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh said the overall demand environment has changed.  “What we've seen over the last four quarters, Q4 and before, attrition has steadily been coming down each quarter on a quarterly basis. We see a lot of the initiatives that we've put in place, and also the overall economic environment, both of them relating to the attrition coming down, our employee engagement scores are continuing to go up and we believe that with that we will have a good control on attrition in the coming quarters,” he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/infosys-defers-pay-hikes-to-employees-10941981.html

However, foreseeing improved margins and strong order books, the brokerages have maintained preference for some of the Tier-1 IT majors.","Weak demand resulting out of recession fears in the US and the recent wage hikes are expected to pressure first-quarter earnings of Indian information technology companies, analysts tracking the IT sector have observed.  In their first quarter preview for the sector, brokerages noted that the orders from the banking and financial services sector, which contributes nearly 30 percent to the IT companies' earnings, are yet to rebound. In addition to the prevaling scenario, declining consumer spending and weak demand from the North American region have only made things tougher for tech companies.  Like was the trend during the March quarter, analysts again see Tier 2 IT companies faring better than Tier 1 players.  Tier-1 vs Tier-2  According to Motilal Oswal, Tier-2 IT companies are expected to outperform their bigger peers by registering a 2.8 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) revenue growth compared to Tier-1 companies, which are expected grow merely by 0.2 percent.  Among Tier-2 IT companies, L&amp;amp;T Technology Services (LTTS) is expected to register an impressive growth of 12.2 percent QoQ on account of its recent acquisition of Smart World and Communications (SWC), its sister business from L&amp;amp;T. Apart from LTTS, Persistent Systems and Coforge are expected to grow by 3.3 percent and 3.2 percent QoQ .  Among the Tier-1 majors, revenue figures for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) are expected to be flat due to weak discretionary spending and wage hikes.  Most analysts also see Tech Mahindra and Wipro seeing a decline in revenues. Kotak Institutional Equities sees a sharp QoQ decline in Tech Mahindra revenues to 1.8 percent owing to a sluggish deal pipeline for its communications vertical, while Wipro IT is expected to slide to 1.9 percent.  In terms of the PAT (profit after taxes) too, the bottomline figures for Tier-1 IT majors are expected to decline by 2.3 percent QoQ contrary to the expectations for Tier-2 which is expected to see an aggregate rise of 6.8 percent QoQ, Motilal Oswal noted.  Margin pressure  A weak topline and wage hikes are expected to hurt the profit margins of IT companies. Foreign broking firm Jefferies in its preview for the sector observed, “Barring LTI Mindtree (LTIM), all companies should witness flat to declining margins in Q1FY24.” Coforge, TCS and Tech Mahindra will see highest margin contraction on account of wage hikes, it further noted.  According to Motilal Oswal, while services and consultancy giant TCS is expected to see a 140 basis points margin decline QoQ, LTIM on the other hand is expected to expand its margin by 30 basis points.  Also read Morgan Stanley downgrades Cyient, sees higher risk for Tech M, TCS, Mphasis  Bias for Tier-1  Although Tier-2 IT companies are expected to fare better, many brokerages prefer to place their bets on Tier-1 companies. Analysts point out that although the revenue numbers may disappoint, profit margins of these companies are expected to be better than those of Tier-2 companies.  EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) or operating profit for Tier-1 IT is expected to improve from 17.3 percent in Q4FY23 to 17.5 percent in Q1FY24. On the other hand, the Tier-2 IT margins are expected to slide to 14.9 percent in Q1FY24 as against 15.3 percent in Q1FY23.  Kotak Institutional Equities has placed Infosys and HCL Technologies (HCL Tech) at the top among its preferences. The domestic brokerage firm expects HCL Tech to retain its revenue growth guidance of 6-8 percent and 18-19 percent EBIT margin guidance for FY2024.  Motilal Oswal has recommended TCS as its top pick, considering a strong order book and expects the company to benefit in the long term. Analysts expect TCS to register strong TCV (total contract value) numbers, backed by the recent BSNL 5G deal win worth $1.83 billion and UK NEST deal worth $1 billion.  Long-drawn recovery  The market is divided on how soon the IT sector will recover. While analysts at BNP Paribas think it could be as soon as the second half of this fiscal, Motilal Oswal expects the recovery to be more gradual and to be complete only in FY25.

At their annual general meetings (AGMs), held a day apart, TCS and Infosys also agreed that the overall demand environment is expected to remain volatile amid macro-economic challenges.  Chairman N Chandrasekaran said that TCS was shifting gears to be more AI-centric.  “Over the past decade, there has been a rapid evolution of digital technologies, bringing about a transformation across every industry. Now, the advancements in AI have made AI transition a central focus…There is a transition already underway from predictive AI to generative AI,” he said on June 29.  Despite a volatile demand environment, at least in the short term, Chandrasekaran was bullish in the long term on growing adoption of predictive AI, generative AI, cloud and IoT by its client companies -- all the areas he believes TCS is strong in.  A day earlier, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh told shareholders that the company had already bagged 50 generative AI projects.  “We have today 50 active client projects where we are using generative AI and this is becoming an increasing part of the new world which is going to be defined on an AI-first basis,” he said.  Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani did flag practical, ethical and intellectual property-related concerns surrounding generative AI.  Chandrasekaran had a similar response when asked about the challenges of generative AI. He concurred that every technology has to be used responsibly, adding, “Countries across the globe will regulate generative AI to be used responsibly.”  In May, TCS and Infosys launched their generative AI offerings TCS Generative AI and Infosys Topaz.  Volatile demand environment  Infosys has already pegged its constant currency revenue growth guidance for FY24 in single digits at 4-7 percent.  Responding to shareholders, Nilekani said though the receding coronavirus pandemic ended one set of challenges, its aftermath created new ones.  “The cocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand volatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency to resilience and security, all morphing quickly and without warning is upon us,” he said, adding they must be flexible.  TCS doesn’t give forward guidance but Chandrasekaran said he was bullish in the mid-to long-term as the company was well-positioned to capture the opportunities and growth coming from trends like artificial intelligence, energy transition, supply-chain shift and the need for new skills.  “I believe that the growth for medium to long term is going to be strong. But in the nearby quarters there will be volatility in different markets on customer spending, especially in discretionary projects. It will go across sectors—some places it will be BFSI, others it will be manufacturing or retail,” he said.  In times of uncertain global economic situation, higher inflation or slowing growth, companies would calibrate their spending, he said. “Whether it will happen in this quarter or after two quarters, it will happen. So certain discretionary spending companies will make a choice. It also depends on the amount of capital they want to spend at this point in time,” Chandrasekaran said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-and-infosys-agms-what-chandrasekaran-nilekani-said-on-ai-demand-concerns-10882621.html

Over the years, he was promoted to Global Head of Sales &amp;amp; Marketing - Banking &amp;amp; Capital Markets, VP &amp;amp; Head of Financial Services in Europe and Executive Vice President – Global Head Financial Services.

According to Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh, the company — which recently announced an AI-first offering, has 50 client projects where the company is using generative AI.  “We have today 50 active client projects where we are using generative AI and this is becoming an increasing part of the new world which is going to be defined on an AI-first basis,” Parekh said.  This comes with the company looking to double down on AI. At the time of the launch of Infosys Topaz, the company said that it was having conversations with over 300 clients about it.  In his address, Chairman Nandan Nilekani cautioned that the advances in generative AI are not without their fair share of complexities — and that several practical, ethical and intellectual property-related issues are still unresolved.  “We know that the path to scaling AI in the enterprise is far from simple. And yet, the AI-first strategy we’ve embraced is already working for us. We have redesigned our organisation to judiciously balance people, technology, and process, while also executing work by segmenting it into cognitive tasks,” he said.  AI and productivity  However, while answering shareholder questions, Nilekani said that there are several short-term issues with AI and that while people believe that there is an extinction risk around humanity, they believe that AI has many possible powerful use cases.  He added that with the right guardrails, AI can be a force for good.  “We will use AI using our Topaz infrastructure and AI-first thinking to bring about transformation of our clients. We will do that using responsible AI — make sure that the AI follows regulatory rules, privacy rules, accuracy rules. We believe that AI can be a force for good with the appropriate guardrails,” Nilekani said.  Among the other concerns surrounding the capabilities of generative AI is that it will replace humans at least in repetitive tasks. In response to whether it will replace humans in the workforce, Nilekani said it has the potential to improve productivity. “We have found that the more qualified the more experienced a person is, you can derive more benefit from AI, like automatic code generation. Definitely, productivity will go up,” he added.  According to CEO Parekh, the company is seeing productivity improvements ranging from 10 percent to 30 percent in different areas. On the question of whether it makes workers redundant, Parekh added that they see a huge level of new type of work.  “Our view is most times when new technologies are coming, they have an impact which changes [how] our clients look at new technologies and that expands the type of work that those new technologies are providing,” he said.  Within the company, Parekh said they are taking their software development modules and approaches, particularly in the product business, and “putting them through the large language model to enhance productivity”, adding that the impact of this will be made through the next few quarters and years.  Demand environment  The chatter around generative AI also comes as IT companies operate in a difficult demand environment, with the guidance’s revenue guidance for FY24 at 4-7 percent.  Chairman Nilekani said that the receding pandemic ended one set of challenges, but its aftermath created new ones. “The cocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand volatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency to resilience and security, all morphing quickly and without warning is upon us,” he said, adding that they must be flexible.  Parekh said that the overall demand environment has changed with the global economy slowing down. “We see now more attention of clients moving from digital and cloud transformation to cost efficiency and automation,” he said.  When questioned about the growth of cloud, Parekh said that becomes the base foundation as companies look to move into the digital age.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/infosys-has-50-client-projects-using-generative-ai-says-ceo-salil-parekh-10875121.html

The BSE Sensex surpassed its previous record high last week, but the Nifty50 fell short by 1 point from its record high. The index has taken support at 18,650 as well as 21-day EMA (exponential moving average 18,631), and closed at 18,665 on Friday.  It has formed a dark cloud cover candlestick pattern on the weekly scale at the swing high, bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, and double-top kind of pattern on the hourly timeframe.  The index is likely to consolidate in the monthly F&amp;amp;O expiry week, and if the index takes support and rebounds, then 18,700-18,900 could be the resistance area, whereas 18,500-18,450 could be the next crucial support in case of correction in coming sessions, experts said.  &quot;My experience indicates that the first bearish signal in a strong bull market often turns out to be a bear trap. It is possible that there will be some correction or consolidation followed by a resumption of the trend,&quot; Prashant Shah, founder of Definedge, said.  For the bulls to regain control, Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Research at Angel One feels the upward movement should start from the current levels.  &quot;If the levels of 18,600-18,650 are breached, then we might witness further price correction towards 18,500-18,450 levels. On the other hand, the bearish gap around 18,750 will now act as an immediate resistance, followed by the all-time high level at 18,888,&quot; he said.  Traders, accordingly, should note that the higher time frame charts continue to look intriguing and suggesting that any future price or time-wise correction should be seen as a buying opportunity for those who missed the upward trend in the past few months, he advised.  Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the May 19 closing prices:  Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  HDFC Life Insurance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 626.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 600 | Target: Rs 660-700 | Return: 12 percent  There is a strong boom in the stock. It has crossed the strong Rs 620 hurdle with increasing volumes. These types of patterns and breakouts help the stock to go up. After reaching Rs 660 level, it is again reacting to retest the break-out level, which will be an opportunity to buy the stock with a stop-loss at 600.  From higher levels, the stock may again move towards Rs 660 or Rs 700 levels. Buy between Rs 630 and Rs 620 for the given levels.

In the last three days correction, the stock corrected back to Rs 977 and may correct further to Rs 950 or 940, which is a 38.20 percent retracement of the entire rally.

The volumes on breakout were high while the RSI oscillator is hinting at a resumption of the positive momentum.  Hence, traders can buy this stock on dips in the range of Rs 665-655 for potential near term target of Rs 720. The stop-loss on long positions should be placed below Rs 630.

Further, a top Infosys executive stated in a parliamentary committee hearing that the company has taken steps to strengthen governance in the country and denied that it used the firm for lobbying.  In a parliamentary hearing, Infosys’ Regional Head for the Asia Pacific region Andrew Groth said that it had paid Synergy360 AU$16 million over a five-year period to help it grow the company’s government business in Australia since it had only worked in commercial contracts up until that point.  In a response to questions by the committee, Groth said that of the $16 million, 70 percent of the amount pertained to the resources required to deliver on the programs it was on, 15 percent for work in terms of sales support, and 15 percent was in success fees. A ‘success fee’ is a type of agreement where the fee is paid when a particular outcome is positive.  “Synergy 360 was appointed in 2018, and was subjected to our onboarding processes and adherence to our supplier code of conduct. I have been advised that Infosys asked Synergy 360 if they were required to be on the Lobbyist Register and they advised, they did not,” Groth said.  He added that Infosys was working with Synergy360 to help advise in growing its government business in the country, and to help design, build, and deliver IT solutions. “We worked to pursue opportunities across state and federal government. I would like to inform the Committee that the relationship with this company has ended,” he added.  That year, Infosys won a contract through open tender to transform a system that the Australian government uses to calculate and pay entitlements to those on welfare — the Entitlement Calculation Engine at Services Australia.  Groth also told the committee that he has met the MP in question 11 times over three-and-a-half years to update him on the progress of the project. He later added that the amount earned on projects done with Services Australia and other government agencies was approximately $190 million.  In a statement, Infosys said that it is cooperating with the Australian parliamentary inquiry in good faith.  &quot;It is important to note that the ECE contract being referenced resulted from a 14-month long stringent government procurement process as per the Australian Government procurement framework. This included government appointed pricing and probity consultants and government legal counsel to ensure an unbiased selection process,&quot; the statement said.

More critically, investors need to be watchful of further exits, especially in delivery leadership (a known gap area at Cognizant), as our channel checks earlier this month indicated high demand for delivery-related roles in the tech industry. Though we see this as an addressable risk, any supply-demand gap in project management could potentially hurt project timelines in the short term.

India is well positioned to grow to a $30-$40 trillion economy over the years, which augurs well for new-age companies in the country, Gopalakrishnan has said ","Amid a series of corporate governance lapses in the Indian startup ecosystem, Kris Gopalakrishnan, co-founder of Infosys and Axilor Ventures, which backs early-stage companies, on June 21 urged investors to have patience and not push founders for immediate results.  Gopalakrishnan’s comments come at a time when Ashwin Swaminathan and Rajat Gupta, founders of Mojocare, a heathtech startup, admitted that they inflated sales bills and overstated revenues to meet investor targets. A group of investors, which includes Chiratae Venture, B Capital and others, have appointed Deloitte to conduct a forensic audit of the company.  The Mojocare episode is a repeat of what had happened at GoMechanic. In January 2023, the founders of the car-servicing startup said that they got carried away, took the growth at-all-costs path and cooked books to show higher sales figures.  The Indian startup ecosystem is the third-largest in the world behind the United States and China. Gopalakrishnan said India is well positioned to grow to a $30-$40 trillion economy over the years, up from about $3.75 trillion, which augurs well for new-age companies.  “Opportunities in the Indian economy and startup ecosystem are real. VCs and investors should not push startups to higher valuations - valuations are (a) result of performance; sometimes (that) takes more time,” he tweeted.  At the same time, “Request startup founders to have patience and build businesses with strong fundamentals. Do not take shortcuts. Negative costs are high,” he added.  Negative costs would mean more difficulty in raising capital, stricter due diligence and the like when startups are already struggling to raise money.  While GoMechanic and Mojocare came on the radar more recently, there have been several such cases in the past year or so in the Indian startup ecosystem.  Earlier this month, Info Edge, the largest shareholder of Broker Network, Rahul Yadav’s second startup, also initiated a forensic audit at Broker Network. Yadav is infamous for the fiasco at Housing.com.  Fintech unicorn BharatPe, tech and commerce platform Zilingo, and lifestyle video app Trell are some of the other startups that find a mention in the list of new-age companies with corporate governance issues.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/infosys-co-founder-kris-gopalakrishnan-urges-startup-community-to-build-with-patience-10832911.html

The Carbon Tracker is aimed at making tennis more environmentally responsible. The feature is live and can be used via the ATP PlayerZone app, which enables players to track and offset their carbon emissions while travelling to participate in tournaments across the global tennis season, a release issued by the company said.  To incentivise lower carbon emissions, the Carbon Tracker will introduce a ‘Green Badge’ that players can earn at the end of each season to be displayed across their profile and rankings pages on ATPTour.com to mark their commitment to sustainability and lower emission targets.

However, considering a strong order book along with the enhanced business opportunities the artificial intelligence (AI) wave brings, companies will continue to perform well, Marcellus Investment Managers founder and CIO Saurabh Mukherjea has said.  Speaking to Moneycontrol, Mukherjea shared his insights on the performance of Indian IT companies and their prospects. Calling the negative stance of analysts on IT akin to an attempt to time steam engines in the midst of the industrial revolution, Mukherjea said, “We are in the middle of a tech revolution. If someone is trying to time IT stocks, you are welcome to try but I am not going to do that.”  Here are some of the factors Mukherjea said will play in favour of the IT industry in the long run:  Strong order books  Although analysts were underwhelmed by the performance of Tier-I stocks, with Infosys deeply disappointing markets, Mukherjea laid out the narrative and numbers posted by TCS as an affirmation of the strength and buoyancy in the business. Marcellus continues to hold TCS in its portfolios, said Mukherjea, noting there is no sign of a slowdown.  Also read: FIIs optimistic on India but dichotomy remains: UBS positively cautious on global investor outlook  “The deal wins of these companies continue to punch through record highs each year, including the last three months. We must note that in spite of the slowdown in the US, TCS announced a record deal,” he said.  In Q4FY23, TCS reported a flat EBIT margin of 24.5 percent, but the order book remained strong with a TCV win of$10 billion, up 28.2% QoQ.  Migration to the cloud  Referring to a finding by global IT major Accenture, Mukherjea pointed out that nearly 70 percent of the Fortune 500 companies are yet to switch to the cloud, which posed a significant growth opportunity.  Migration to the cloud for seamless data accessibility is a prerequisite for enhanced AI usage in tech businesses. “You cannot benefit from Generative AI as a corporation if you don’t move your kit to the cloud.”  According to Mukherjea, this prerequisite can play to the benefit of Indian IT firms which can enable this migration as and when the US-based companies increase their spending on IT.  While speculating further on how tech firms will perform, Mukherjea cited market intelligence and data services provider International Data Corporation's (IDC) forecast, which has raised its outlook for the Asia/Pacific region and the United States.  Contrary to major brokerages, IDC expects global IT and business services revenue to grow 5.7 percent year-on-year (YoY) in FY24. Stating that it wasn’t merely quarterly results but such larger metrics that he bases his decisions upon, Mukherjea said, “I fail to see where the slowdown is. So, at a time when people merely jump up and down over Q4 results ignoring other positives, it is a great opportunity for sensible investors to make money.”  Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Nelco Ltd. | CMP Rs 718.95 | Shares of Tata Group subsidiary NELCO rose approximately 3 percent to Rs 756 on June 6 after the company entered into an agreement with the promoters and other shareholders of Piscis Networks. NELCO made an initial investment of Rs 99,99,100 to subscribe to 1,111 equity shares of Rs 10 each, representing 9.09 percent of the paid-up capital of Piscis Networks. During the March quarter, consolidated net sales increased by 14 percent YoY to Rs 81.98 crore, while quarterly net profit soared by 87 percent to Rs 5.66 crore.   HBL Power Systems Ltd. | CMP Rs 136 | HBL Power Systems saw a 6 percent surge on June 6 due to growing optimism in the market regarding the deployment of the Kavach System by the government to prioritise rail safety following the Odisha train tragedy.

Allcargo Logistics Ltd. | CMP Rs 284.40 | Shares of Allcargo Logistics surged 3 percent on June 6 after Transindia Real Estate agreed to divest a 10 percent stake each in five Allcargo subsidiaries and a 100 percent holding in Allcargo Multimodal to Blackstone.   EKI Energy Services Ltd. | CMP Rs 430.65 | EKI Energy Services' share price climbed 5 percent to Rs 430.65 on June 6 after the company announced the establishment of a wholly-owned subsidiary called EKI Community Development Foundation. However, the stock has faced a significant decline due to concerns raised by Walker Chandiok &amp;amp; Co LLP, the auditor, regarding the accuracy and completeness of its financial statements. EKI Energy Services Ltd. is yet to report its March quarter earnings for FY23.   Capacite Infraprojects Ltd. | CMP Rs 190.65 | Capacite Infraprojects shares rose 6 percent to a new 52-week high of Rs 193.55 on June 6.

infosys,2023-06-05T08:48:22+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Analysts Call Tracker: Infosys sees maximum downgrades since last quarter,"For fiscal year FY24, the IT giant has set a revenue growth target of 4-7 percent. This marks the first time since FY18 that the company's revenue is expected to fall within this guided range.","Infosys Ltd was hit by a wave of downgrades recently after posting weak March quarter earnings. According to Analyst Call Tracker, Infosys Ltd's number of &quot;buy&quot; recommendations on the stock from a quarter ago fell to 29 from 42 and the number of &quot;hold&quot; and &quot;sell&quot; ratings fell to 9 each from the previous four and two respectively.  Recently, the IT major fell short of its projected revenue growth for the year after disclosing its Q4 numbers. The company achieved a full-year growth rate of 15.4 percent, slightly below its guidance range of 16-16.5 percent. In Q4FY23, the reported revenue amounted to $4,554 million, experiencing a decline of 2.2 percent in absolute terms and 3.2 percent when adjusted for constant currency.  For fiscal year FY24, the IT giant has set a revenue growth target of 4-7 percent. This marks the first time since FY18 that the company's revenue is expected to fall within this guided range. The lower revenue guidance is attributed to reduced client spending and an uncertain demand environment triggered by meltdowns in US banks.  Following the negative outlook provided by Infosys for India's technology sector in the aftermath of the US and European bank turmoil, several brokerages, including JP Morgan, Macquarie, and Citi, have acted by downgrading the stock and reducing its target price.  Many analysts anticipate a further deterioration in the outlook for the Indian IT services sector throughout FY24. Nomura's India unit, for instance, stated that the current fiscal year is likely to be marked by disappointing revenue growth for many IT companies in the country. According to Nomura's report, &quot;Increasing macroeconomic headwinds are expected to present challenges in terms of growth, as enterprises delay decision-making and prioritize cost optimization projects that yield immediate benefits, rather than transformation projects with delayed returns.&quot;  In its recent report Icra has predicted a further slowdown in revenue growth for Indian IT companies, projecting it to reach mid-single digits. The sector, which is valued at nearly $250 billion, is facing escalating challenges and uncertainties that will likely impact hiring, with companies expected to maintain low levels of employee additions in the near future. In fact, the net addition of employees has been negative in the last two quarters of FY23.  According to a report by industry lobby group Nasscom published in March, the growth of the sector already decelerated to 8.4 percent in FY23 from over 15 percent in the previous fiscal year. Despite Indian IT services companies having a strong order book and deal pipelines, Icra expects revenue growth to remain subdued in mid-single digits in USD terms for FY2024.  The prevailing uncertainties are expected to continue to influence the hiring landscape, leading to restrained employee additions. Nasscom's report highlights the challenges faced by the sector, and Icra's projections further underscore the subdued growth expectations for Indian IT companies in the coming fiscal year.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/analysts-call-tracker-infosys-sees-maximum-downgrades-since-last-quarter-10741551.html
infosys,2023-06-03T10:22:07+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,Infosys CEO Salil Parekh's salary falls 21% to Rs 56.44 crore in FY23,Salil Parekh made 627 times the median remuneration —  Rs 9 lakh — of the IT services company’s employees but he was still not the highest paid. Infosys president Mohit Joshi earned Rs 57.32 crore in FY23. He leaves the company on June 9 to take over as Tech Mahindra CEO,"Infosys Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Salil Parekh’s FY23 compensation stood at Rs 56.44 crore, down from Rs 71 crore in the previous year, the Bengaluru-based IT services company’s annual report shows.  The fall is primarily because Parekh exercised fewer restricted stock units (RSUs) during the year. Restricted stock units is a form of equity compensation offered to employees. Infosys offers RSUs based on two plans. Under its 2015 plan, the stocks are vested largely based on time but under the 2019 plan, the benefit is based on performance. The performance indicators include total shareholder return and the company’s operating metrics.  Infosys’ cross-town rival Wipro’s CEO Thierry Delaporte drew Rs 82.4 crore during the year, a fall of 5 percent from the financial year 2021-22.  Parekh’s remuneration comprises fixed pay, variable pay, retiral benefits and the perquisite value of stock incentives exercised during the period. Infosys said that Parekh’s remuneration dropped 21 percent from the previous year.  How it stacks up  Of the Rs 56.44 crore compensation, Infosys said Parekh earned Rs 30.6 crore by exercising his RSUs. Last fiscal, Parekh earned Rs 52.33 crore by exercising his RSUs, making him one of India’s highest-paid CEOs.  In FY23 fiscal, Parekh earned Rs 6.67 crore in base pay, Rs 45 lakh as retiral benefits and Rs 18.73 crore was his variable pay or bonus for the year. His variable pay went up from Rs 12.62 crore in 2022 to Rs 18.73 crore in 2023.  Parekh made 627 times the median remuneration —Rs 9 lakh — of the company’s employees. While the gap was narrower from the previous year but it came in a year characterised by fresher onboarding delays, variable pay cuts and more as the industry faced increased uncertainty.  Parekh, however, wasn’t the highest paid at Infosys. It was president Mohit Joshi, who resigned in March after being named Tech Mahindra CEO. Joshi earned Rs 57.32 crore in FY23. He leaves Infosys on June 9.  In his letter to shareholders, Parekh said FY23 was a strong year for the company’s business, with a growth of over 15 percent and operating margins at $2.5 billion.  “Last year we returned US$3.1 billion to our shareholders – US$1.7 billion as dividend and US$1.4 billion through our share buyback program. At the end of the financial year, we were the leading company among our peers in total shareholder return over the past five years,” he said.  Parekh added that in the last few quarters, the global economy had been dealing with inflation, interest rate increases, and changes in demand environment for companies in various industries.  “Our strength in digital, cloud, and in automation, along with cost efficiency capabilities have held us in good stead. These will continue to be critical in the evolving economic environment,” he said.  Disruptions ahead  Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani did not draw any remuneration for the year.  In his letter to shareholders, co-founder Nilekani wrote that the one overriding theme defining the world was that was “suffused with uncertainty”.  “The placid and the predictable are behind us as each new day brings new inputs and new events that derail the carefully-crafted models we have constructed of the world around us.  “The cocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand volatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency to resilience and security, all stirring quickly and without warning, is what’s before us. In any week, we may oscillate from caution to optimism and back to caution based on the news of the day.” Nilekani said.  These times required companies to be efficient as well as flexible, he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/infosys-ceo-salil-parekhs-pay-falls-21-to-rs-56-44-crore-in-fy23-10735891.html
infosys,2023-06-02T09:42:25+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,3 of India's top 5 IT firms saw revenue per employee decline in last five years,"HCLTech reported the sharpest fall of 11% in 5-year CAGR. However, at $55,704 aggregate revenue per employee, it’s still the highest among the top five ","The aggregate revenue per employee for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Wipro, and HCLTech, with the exception of Infosys and Tech Mahindra, experienced a decline of 3.8-11 percent on a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) basis in FY23. This decline was driven by the increase in hiring across these companies in response to the Covid pandemic-driven demand, surpassing net revenue growth, which remained relatively slow paced due to lower margins in digital deals.  Revenue per employee is a metric that is used to roughly calculate the revenue generated by each employee in a firm, in a given time frame. Aggregate revenue per employee is calculated based on the total headcount of a company, while billable revenue per employee only includes the people who are billable on a project. This means that billable revenue per employee does not consider adjacent function staff, such as HR, finance, or sales.  HCLTech experienced the biggest dip in CAGR, with a decline of 11 percent. However, its aggregate revenue per employee, at $55,704, is the highest among its top 5 peers (Infosys and Tech Mahindra are the other two in that list). The significant decline can be attributed to a mismatch between its headcount growth and revenue growth, as evident in data from market intelligence firm UnearthInsight, accessed by Moneycontrol.  Over the last five years, HCLTech's headcount grew at a CAGR of 63.8 percent, while its revenue grew at the rate of 45.8 percent. Similarly, Wipro saw 40.5 percent CAGR in headcount for a 35.2 percent CAGR in revenue for the same period.  An HCLTech spokesperson told Moneycontrol, &quot;Over the past several years, HCLTech has consistently delivered industry-leading organic revenue growth. In recent years, the proportion of work delivered by our India-based and nearshore employees has gone up, which yields lower revenue per employee compared to high-cost locations.&quot;  &quot;Further larger induction of freshers with longer training cycles has contributed to the change in revenue per employee,” the spokesperson added.  Infosys was the only company in the services segment with revenue exceeding $10 billion to achieve a positive 2.6 percent CAGR in aggregate revenue per employee over the past five years. On the other hand, Tech Mahindra experienced approximately 5.6 percent growth in aggregate revenue per employee during the same period, driven by improved billing (both Tech/BPM) and operational efficiency, including reductions in non-billable and support headcount.  The overall billable revenue per employee for the remaining IT/tech services industry combined was $48,195 in FY23, in contrast to $53,550 for the top five players.     Low margins, slower revenue growth  According to Gaurav Vasu, founder and CEO of UnearthInsight, this trend in the revenue per employee metric was due to technology billing rates becoming a lot more commoditised, coupled with a sudden increase in overall headcount.  However, he added, “Linearity between revenue growth and headcount addition still exists in the sub-services and BPO services segments. There are some pockets of services and offerings that have started seeing a non-linear trend.”  Unlike the popular belief that a significant uptick in larger digital deals along with talent hiring will lead to higher revenue per employee, the margins for such deals have been lower. Today, most of the deals bagged by IT companies are digital transformation deals.  “Over the last few years, IT companies have been under tremendous cost pressures from clients and competition alike — margins have come down significantly. As a result, the revenue for the same number of people is much lower. That’s a secular trend across companies,” Ashutosh Sharma, head of research, Forrester Research India, said.  Mrinal Rai, principal analyst at technology research firm ISG, concurred. “Digital deals may not always be high-value deals. Initially revenue grew across IT companies and then they started hiring a lot more than they needed. Now, they have started cutting down the workforce. FY19 and FY23 are very different stories,” he said.  Emailed queries sent to TCS, Infosys, Wipro and Tech Mahindra didn't elicit any response at the time of publishing.  Headcount addition trends  This slowdown in aggregate revenue per employee for some companies on a five-year CAGR basis is also because the IT companies weren’t hiring much for three years pre-pandemic, according to HDFC Securities’ deputy vice-president Amit Chandra.  “A lot of capacity building happened during the post-Covid demand surge. The hiring trend between FY16-19 was negligible. That was the era when it was thought that automation will reduce human effort and legacy hiring will fall very sharply. But it did not happen, there was a sudden IT talent scarcity with the post-covid demand surge. Especially last year, there was pyramid broadening,” he said.  While most IT companies thought that automation and the shift to getting more digital deals will decrease higher employee dependency, creating a non-linear relation between revenue growth and headcount increase unlike in earlier times, that wasn’t the case for all.  Sharma said that it also depends on the organisation’s ability to move away from headcount-based revenue models. Infosys, for instance, has done a marginally better job than its peers in bringing platform-based solutions and services into deals, which delinks revenue from the headcount.  “TCS, HCLTech and Wipro could do better in this area. TCS has a big success in BaNCS, but they struggle replicating that in other verticals. HCLTech and Wipro have some capabilities in DRYiCE and Holmes respectively but not much to show beyond these,” he added.  The IT sector reported record hiring numbers in FY22, both in lateral hiring and fresher additions. The top five firms collectively added around 273,377 employees by the end of the fiscal year. This increase in hiring was driven by the growing demand for digital transformation deals and the shortage of tech talent in the market.  However, this trend reversed in FY23 due to various macroeconomic challenges, including the Russia-Ukraine war, an impending recession in key markets like the US, inflation, interest rate hikes, and most recently, a global banking crisis.  As a result, there was a significant year-on-year drop of over 69 percent in hiring across the top five firms in FY23. Together, these firms only added 83,906 employees as the focus shifted towards improving utilisation rates.  How TCS and Infosys fared  TCS, the largest IT services company in the country, witnessed the second-lowest aggregate revenue per employee, with a decline of 7.8 percent in a five-year CAGR. According to Vasu, a part of the reason for this was TCS having a significant chunk of its revenue from the domestic market as compared to its peers, which means the billing rates will be lower.  “TCS’ revenue per employee growth is also low because a significant chunk of their revenue comes from the domestic India market. It gets almost $2 billion or more of its revenue from India, and has the highest presence among its peers,” Vasu said.  Rightly so, in FY23, TCS reported the highest revenue contribution from India, at 5 percent, while Infosys earned 3.2 percent, and Wipro reported 4 percent, respectively. The IT sector, overall, earns less than 5 percent of its total revenue from India, as the US and Europe remain the key markets.  Meanwhile, Infosys, the second-largest IT services company in India, witnessed 2.6 percent growth in aggregate revenue per employee due to its ability to sustain billing rates. Additionally, the company successfully managed to add a lower headcount for the revenue it generated, according to Vasu.  Furthermore, Infosys continues to maintain lean project management structures as well as leaner internal IT, HR, and sales teams, Vasu added. He expects the revenue per employee metric for these IT companies to start improving in the coming fiscal years.  “The revenue per employee will start improving in FY24 and FY25 because the biggest dip came in FY21 when the companies expected higher growth and they hired a lot. Right now hiring is seeing a downtrend, so we expect a lot more focus on improving productivity and a lot of caution-based hiring to happen,” Vasu said.  “Aggregate revenue per employee at an industry level will start going down by 2-5 percent over the next 12-18 months,” he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/3-of-indias-top-5-it-firms-saw-revenue-per-employee-decline-in-last-five-years-10730091.html
infosys,2023-05-31T17:53:06+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"Just do IT! Here’s how to play the IT theme currently, as per analysts","India's tier-1 IT firms have a high correlation to S&amp;P500 revenue growth, which is expected to decelerate over the next two quarters","Small may not always be beautiful, but it certainly merits a second look, at least in the IT space. With the Indian IT sector buffeted by global macro headwinds, analysts are of the view that one of the best bets to ride out the storm would be the smaller IT firms, which are projected to sustain their growth premium over the tier-1 pack.  The domestic IT industry largely delivered a disappointing Q4 show amid the gathering clouds of recession in the West and the banking crisis in the US – the bread-and-butter market for India’s software service exporters.  “The macro challenges are manifesting into a set of outcomes for the sector ranging from cuts in discretionary spending, delay in decision making (slower conversion from pipeline to total contract value or TCV), slower deal ramp-up, to change in the propensity for price increases/volume discounts,” HDFC Securities said in a recent report.  However, the deteriorating operative environment and soured sentiment are bigger worries for frontline IT companies.  “India tier-1 IT has a high correlation to S&amp;amp;P500 revenue growth, which includes large customers across verticals and the growth rate is expected to decelerate over the next two quarters,” analysts at HDFC Securities added.  Of course, there are gradations of pain within the tier-1 pack.  HDFC Securities believes Tech Mahindra and Infosys have a higher risk from large clients moderating spend, and TCS scores above Infosys both in BFSI and non-BFSI industry verticals.  “Mid-tier IT on average scores slightly above tier-1 IT, supported by ER&amp;amp;D companies,” it said. “Mid-tier IT growth premium is expected to continue—both on revenue growth and profit growth in FY24E, supported by vertical and enterprise-specific drivers.”  Growth Drivers  A key driver is the engineering R&amp;amp;D (ER&amp;amp;D) segment within the manufacturing vertical.  Interestingly, the manufacturing vertical (including industrials and automotive) had the highest count of enterprises increasing their outlook and beating the estimates this earnings season.    &amp;nbsp;  In a recent note on L&amp;amp;T Technology Services (LTTS), Motilal Oswal too highlighted the contribution of this segment.  “We continue to view LTTS as a beneficiary of the growing penetration of ER&amp;amp;D services,” it noted, adding that digitization is driving the accelerated spends in ER&amp;amp;D.  Stating that ER&amp;amp;D pureplay guidance for FY24E is a strong growth premium over tier-1 IT, HDFC Securities said Cyient, Tata Elxsi and L&amp;amp;T Technology Services are expected to grow above the low-teens for FY24E as compared to mid-single-digit growth expected for tier-1 IT firms.  Head-to-head: TCS trounces Infosys on all fronts of financials  In a recent report, Kotak Institutional Equities too said it expects mid-tier companies with strong domain understanding and capabilities to beat tier-1 companies in terms of growth.  “Quality mid-tier [companies] can deliver double-digit growth in FY2024. Portfolio mix that is tuned to growth with lower legacy drag, quality management team and strong sales focus are aiding healthy growth even in a less friendly environment,” the brokerage said.  However, it added that tier-1 companies that offer a full suite of services are most likely to weather the slowdown.

","The account aggregator (AA) framework is cross-sectoral and can be used beyond the financial sector for skilling, healthcare and education, among other things, said Infosys chairman, cofounder and Aadhaar architect Nandan Nilekani, highlighting the possibility of inclusive growth using this model.  “Within the financial sector itself, it is across banking, capital markets, insurance, pension and so on, with the same architecture applying to them. But it is also cross-sectoral, as it can be applied for skills, educational records and health records,” Nilekani said while addressing a session at Sahamati’s Samvaad 2023, on May 24.  Nilekani has worked extensively on the architecture and execution of the Indian digital public infrastructure (DPI) including Aadhaar, UPI, ONDC and AA.  While the ease of lending will be seen as the engine-driver, taking off in a big way with the help of the AA framework, according to Nilekani, the model holds various possibilities for innovation in other sectors as well.  ALSO READ: Account Aggregator a door opener for financial inclusion, guardrails needed to check data misuse: CEA V Anantha Nageswaran  “There are many use cases, we do not know what we have unleashed with this framework, when it comes to innovation,” he said.  Touted as the UPI moment for lending, the AA framework ensures quick data sharing with the consent of the user and eliminates the need for physical documents.  AAs are licensed by the RBI to enable the flow of data between Financial Information Providers (FIPs) and Financial Information Users (FIUs). The user has to give consent on what data can be shared.  The RBI, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), and Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) collaborated to allow regulated entities under their control to share data with account aggregators after obtaining user consent.  Nilekani also said that the AA framework is incentivising people to join the system, boosting the growth of a formal economy.  “Historically, there has been no incentive for joining the system. It meant more cumbersome bureaucracy, paying taxes, and all the other consequences of formalisation but the AA model is providing them a grand bargain,” said Nilekani.  He said that the AA framework is at the heart of creating inclusive growth in India as it allows individuals and small business owners to avail credit with the help of the digital footprint they create.  According to the Infosys co-founder, with the AA framework providing this data in the hands of the user it belongs to, individuals and MSMEs can now use it to improve their lives. “AA is at the heart of creating inclusive growth in India, not just a digital transformation but a social transformation,” he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/account-aggregator-model-is-cross-sectoral-can-be-used-beyond-finance-nandan-nilekani-10652871.html
infosys,2023-05-24T13:26:08+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,The waiting game: IT freshers suffer agony and desperation as top firms delay onboarding for a year,"Fresh engineering graduates in India hired by top IT companies are facing financial strain, mental health issues and dashed career aspirations due to prolonged delays in onboarding. ","Dhwani, a final-year engineering graduate, was euphoric when she got a selection mail from Infosys in March 2022. However, the joy of landing a dream job with a big IT firm soon turned into panic when she had to mail the company every day for updates about when she can start her job.  “Once I got a call from them stating that I will be onboarded within a month and they asked me to stop sending emails. I did. It's been over nine months since that call. I’ve got no response since,” she says.  The endless wait has taken a toll on Dhwani as not being able to help her family financially for reasons out of her control is bogging her down further.  She’s far from alone. Desperation, scrambling, feeling stuck in limbo, and even thoughts of suicide — these are some of the things that are on the minds of freshers who graduated a year ago but continue to wait for onboarding by IT companies. Their fears have only compounded as from the time they were made an offer to when they graduated, the industry took a turn for the worse.  Fresher onboarding has been delayed by several companies such as Wipro, LTIMindtree, Mphasis, and others, albeit the first may be the most well-documented. And despite the passage of a year, some freshers continue to hope that the onboarding call may come, even if it may be for lack of any other option.  A slim chance  Ritesh, another fresher awaiting the call from Tech Mahindra for a year-and-a-half, says more than anything, it's the radio silence that’s unacceptable. He was part of the batch whose graduation was delayed due to the pandemic, putting him at a further disadvantage. Technically from the batch of 2021 and not 2022 — it's a matter of getting closure for Ritesh now. “Being such a big MNC, such behaviour from Tech Mahindra is unacceptable. There should at least be an update that the drive has been cancelled. There should be an official update so we don’t cling to hope anymore,” he says.  With onboarding delayed across several companies, freshers had banded together and formed Telegram groups — to coordinate, ask the company for information, get updates from each other and in general, foster a sense of community. Conversations on these groups initially used to be passionate with anger directed at the companies— sometimes by commenting en masse on LinkedIn posts of executives of the companies in question. Updates would come thick and fast, with every news report and every bit of hearsay being shared. However, after a year, the conversation in these groups has muted, and now there are largely requests for help with technical questions, and sometimes, referrals for other jobs.  Ravi, another fresher waiting for Wipro’s onboarding, grows increasingly agitated during the conversation and doesn’t have much hope that the call from Wipro will come. He has been making ends meet by working as a daily-wage labourer. Ravi even went through Wipro’s ‘Velocity’ upskilling program but even that hasn’t bettered his chances. He is now moving back to his village to work on his family’s land.  Loans and expectations start bearing down  Even as they wait, there is pressure from family as well as looming loan repayments. “I am getting calls from my bank every other day for loan repayment,” says Ravi.  “I have paid Rs 85,000 per year, for my engineering course. I took a loan for it, now I am getting calls from the bank asking me to start repaying the loan. There are 4 members in my family, my father is the only earning member. It is difficult to make ends meet with just one person earning,” he says.  Kumar, another graduate awaiting Wipro’s call, had taken a loan of Rs 1.5 lakh, which he hoped to pre-close. Instead, his repayments start in September, and he says the job has to come through by then, in order to start making the payments. Apart from the loans, those waiting for the onboarding call also have to deal with taunts from family as well as pressure from them for not having started their job yet.  “My college touted these top 5 companies to be the best. Instead, people hired by mid-sized companies have jobs. My family sees them and thinks it's because I don't have skills,” he says.  Dhwani, on the other hand, is also under pressure because of a large education loan. “Of course, I’m under pressure. I'm from a middle-class family. My parents had huge expectations of me but I failed to meet them. I have an education loan of nearly Rs 8 lakh. My family needs my support in these tough conditions. Instead of helping them financially, I have become a burden on them,” she says.    Paras, a counselling psychologist and co-founder of The Alternative Story, says that graduating and getting your first job is one of the big milestones that people of this generation look to achieve. “Graduating and getting the first job are markers of having come of age, and there’s a lot of hope riding on somebody's first job, especially if they come from the lower strata of society,” he says.  He adds that youngsters put in work and get an offer but when things don’t work out, it’s not just their confidence that’s impacted but it also takes away a sense of control. “You grew up believing that if you put in the work and follow the process, there would be results. When the results don't come, you question why you did any of this in the first place. It’s a loss of identity, it’s a major setback,” he adds.  The dream of a technical job  Kumar, Ravi, Ritesh, and Dhwani all say the same thing — non-technical roles are available but technical roles are what they want.  Ravi rues that no one is hiring freshers, even when they look out — whether it be startups or established companies. “I am not interested in non-technical roles. In tech roles, I am ready to work for any company even if they give a small salary. But there is no hiring whatsoever,” says Ravi.  Ritesh, in fact, took up a job at a BPO to help pay the bills after he drained his savings. At this stage, the BPO job pays more than what Tech Mahindra offered but for him, it's a question of the big picture career prospects. “I’ve done graduation with a technical degree I should get a job for a technical degree. I joined this company because I can’t sit idle. I need money for my expenses alone if nothing else,” he says. He also rues that the four years he spent studying engineering would be a waste.  “My course cost Rs 12 lakh. We've invested this amount so we can have a better future. All savings are gone,” he says.  Kumar, too, says that non-technical roles are available, even if it's at slightly lesser pay but he’s not taking them up as he wants a technical role.  But what about using such jobs as a stop-gap? He says Wipro is supposed to give a two-month heads-up prior to onboarding, but they are only informed a week in advance. “If I join another company now, I have a one-month notice period. I can't even get out quickly. I cannot quit that quickly and join officially.”  “I’m a phase 1 hire in Wipro. If I do say something and leave that previous company, I can get rejected at the background verification stage. It'll be a waste to have waited for this year when I could have taken a non-technical job. I’m too afraid to pick up anything else as it may lead to some cancellation when Wipro eventually comes through. If they actually give us a two-month heads up, I'd take a non-technical job, make some money, resign properly, and come and join,” Kumar says.  Upskill scramble  All four of them have been doing courses online to upskill — free or otherwise. Kumar took a machine learning course from Coursera, and even wrote to them and availed financial aid to be able to afford it. But it’s not enough.  When freshers go to job fairs, they are asked tech stack-oriented questions. “If I sit for the interviews of 5 companies, one wants Java, another wants Python. When everyone is asking for different things it's very confusing to decide which one to study for. Every time there is an interview, I learn whatever I can for that interview because it'll take 2-2.5 months to learn it fully. It’s very shallow learning,” Kumar says.  “My career has had a break and I'm juggling substitute measures. I get asked why I have such a long break, so side-by-side I am doing some projects and I'm claiming that I was doing this instead to show that my time has been useful,” he adds.  Fear of being terminated  In most IT companies in question, freshers have to undergo training and assessment before they are deployed on billable projects. Given the gap between their graduation and the call for onboarding, any termination of employment for failing the assessment is a double blow in cases where candidates have remained unemployed for over 8 months. It’s a sword hanging over the heads of these graduates — especially as they see it happen to their peers and friends.  Wipro recently got flak for this practice, after it was revealed that the employment of 452 freshers had been terminated. In an interview with Moneycontrol last month, Chief Human Resources Officer Saurabh Govil said that assessments have been happening for years as people are away from actual work from the time they graduate till the time they are onboarded. “It is to help them get trained and again make an investment in them. I don't know why it's becoming an issue,” he said.  However, Kumar claims that these assessments have become harder, with fewer chances to clear them.  He’s now in a no-win situation — waiting for his chance to be onboarded and putting off other things but also terrified of losing the job even when he does get the opportunity.  This combination of unpredictable situations has a mental health impact that can’t be understated, says Paras, especially given there is no support system in this case where the onboarding is random.  “When a situation is both isolating as well as unpredictable, those are the kinds of situations that have the worst kind of mental health impacts. In times of uncertainty, when you don’t have even a modicum of control and the unpredictability is also there in full force, that is the worst kind of effect,” he says.  In some cases, it has led to depression and even thoughts of suicide. “I do have thoughts of attempting suicide at night when I go to sleep. Every night I wonder why I’m living this life if I’m even allowed to trouble my parents like this. What if I attempt suicide instead?” Dhwani says.  Queries sent to Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Wipro were unanswered.  What should companies do?  The delay in onboarding, lack of clarity on when it may be, as well as the assessments have caused a lot of angst among fresh graduates — whether it be Wipro, LTIMindtree, or any other IT major. Companies across the board have maintained that all offers they have made will be honoured, but no timelines have been offered.  This isn’t the first time it’s happened— HR experts say this scenario played out in 2009 (due to the financial crisis) and around the time of the dotcom bust in 2001 as well. In the case of the former too, onboarding was delayed by nearly a year, and assessments were put in place. However, the delay tends to have a cascading effect, where the next batch is also affected as hiring is down.  It happened to foundit (formerly Monster) CEO Sekhar Garisa too. “I had to wait for nine months for my onboarding but looking back now, it really hasn't changed my career trajectory at all,&quot; he says. &quot;A small setback for a few months or a year won't change your career as long as you remain positive and focus on advancing your knowledge and skills. Use this time intentionally to develop your knowledge, skills, personality, and fitness. Once you're caught up in the career treadmill, you won't have this opportunity to upskill again,” he says.  Former Infosys HR head Nandita Gurjar says the impact on the individual remains the same, no matter how many are impacted.  She stresses that large IT companies must make a commitment, and can afford to do so.  “Large companies should really communicate when onboarding will happen. Large companies cannot say that I can't make a commitment, they can afford to have them unutilised on the bench. People's careers are on hold. The uncertainty of when it is going to happen is even more torturous than having the information that it will be delayed,” she says.  Talent solutions firm Diamondpick co-founder Sriram Rajagopal says the pressure is also more due to the placement schedule of colleges, which leads companies to hire a year in advance. The recruiting cycle must shift by six months, he adds.  The solution for this would potentially be to create a fungible entry-level common pool of talent at an industry level where companies can use them depending on the need, he says, rather than hiring and not being able to honour the commitments.  Advice for graduates  Gurjar and Rajagopal, as well as people in the education industry, stress only one thing: students need to upskill.  “Graduates of the 2022 batch can make good of the waiting period through upskilling certifications as entry-level job opportunities in emerging areas are still available. Recruiters who are delaying onboarding may also offer free certification programs to them and facilitate alternate job prospects. Students are advised to also be on the lookout for pooled recruitment drives and other direct recruitment happening on a real-time basis,” says S Vaidhyasubramaniam Vice-Chancellor, SASTRA University.  Gurjar also stresses that they should start reskilling, know at least two or three of the languages and learn newer skills.  “Spending time on learning, instead of believing that it's now the organisation's job to make sure that they give them work — I think is an attitude of the old. We have to start changing their attitude and saying that it’s my job to get myself utilised and not sit on the bench,” she says.  Rajagopal adds they have to work toward making their profile distinct and unique, so they can grab eyeballs.  “Upskill in relevant skills, make your profile unique and be competitive. Especially in the world of generative AI, the need for thousands of programmers is going to go away very soon. You’re going to have generative AI as an assistant to your programmer. IT services are going through a change. People have to be aware, pick up skills that are relevant, and be current,” he advises.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/the-waiting-game-it-freshers-suffer-agony-and-desperation-as-top-firms-delay-onboarding-for-a-year-10651721.html

Catamaran Ventures LLP, which began operations in 2009, will raise its assets under management to as much as $2 billion and is exploring strategic partnerships in three new areas: deep tech, precision engineering and manufacturing, and renewables, according to Chairman MD Ranganath. That marks a shift from the firm’s prior focus on services, he said in a recent interview.  Murthy helped build Infosys into one of India’s national champions by pioneering a novel strategy of outsourcing technology services. His daughter, Akshata Murty, the wife of UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, is a director at the British branch of the clan’s investment firm, a separate entity.  Catamaran Ventures, based in Bangalore, employs about 15 staff in India overseeing holdings spanning e-sports, insurance and Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp.  “For the next stage of India’s growth, manufacturing is clearly one of the trajectories,” Ranganath said. “The advantage for India is all this innovation can be tested in India for scale, and then taken to the global markets.”  To back this growth, Catamaran Ventures will actively seek partners to build businesses in the sub-sectors it selects, and add four specialists to its team of investment professionals, Ranganath said. It’s looking to close at least one such partnership in the next few months, he added.  Amazon Partnership Murthy’s venture firm previously partnered with Amazon.com Inc. to build up Prione Business Services, which began by helping merchants get online to sell their wares before becoming a dominant vendor itself. Catamaran Ventures’ stake was ultimately bought out by Amazon.  The firm will continue to back early- and late-stage companies, according to Ranganath. Catamaran Ventures has also invested in social network Reddit and the National Stock Exchange, India’s largest bourse, according to its website.  Nearly a third of the firm’s investments are in early-stage companies and the rest is evenly split between late-stage and growth enterprises, according to President Deepak Padaki. The firm has also partnered with early-stage funds, he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/billionaire-infosys-founder-to-double-private-firms-investments-10648591.html

infosys,2023-05-23T15:06:00+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,"Infosys unveils AI-first offering Topaz, sees huge interest from clients",Infosys’ efforts in AI come a time when technology demand is slowing down in its major markets such as the US and Europe.,"Software major Infosys on May 23 unveiled Topaz, a new offering that combines data analytics, artificial intelligence, and generative AI, signifying the growing importance of this fast-evolving technology.  Infosys, one of the early donors to OpenAI, said it has used its own applied artificial intelligence (AI) framework to develop an AI-first core that potentially has over 12,000 use cases, more than 150 pre-trained models, and over ten platforms.  The company’s efforts in AI also come at a time when technology demand is slowing down in its major markets such as the US and Europe. A new AI-first offering could help the company offer a more compelling pitch for clients, who have turned increasingly cautious about tech spends.  “We are seeing strong interest from our clients for efficiency and productivity-enhancing programs, even as businesses are keen to secure their future growth. Our own business operations have been hugely benefited by Infosys Topaz bringing the power of generative AI platforms and data solutions,” Salil Parekh, CEO &amp;amp; MD, Infosys, said.  Speaking to Moneycontrol, Satish HC, Executive Vice President and Co-Head of Delivery at Infosys, said the company is first experimenting with AI within the organisation, taking experiences from that and then curating solutions for clients. Infosys counts Fortune 500 banks, retail firms, among others, as clients.  “Our clients will hear a lot of advisory on how to go about it, how to scale this, what to do, what not to do, and how do we navigate some of the risks that we see today,” he said.  Competitive intensity is also going up among IT firms seeking to build more in this space.  Cognizant’s CEO Ravi Kumar S had said during the company’s earnings last quarter that breakthroughs in generative AI offer the potential to “fundamentally transform our client's businesses and increase our own productivity”. The company said it working to industrialise solutions to common challenges.  “We are operating pilots that use generative AI to accelerate consulting, design, engineering, and operations with the long-term goal of doubling the productivity of our associates,” he said.  Similarly, Tata Consultancy Services Chief Operating Officer NG Subramaniam said that the company will have a centre of excellence around generative AI. Subramaniam said that generative AI can accelerate the adoption of technology, including those which are at the frontier areas of innovation.  Opportunities and pricing  According to Satish, Infosys is already engaged in generative AI work on many projects with their existing clients, and they are currently involved in over 300 client conversations around this. Satish said that the company decided to get into the space because of the massive opportunity it presents.  Given that Infosys donated to OpenAI in 2015, when it was structured as a non-profit, Satish said that the IT firm does not have a stake in the company. However, he said that many of the things that OpenAI is providing for businesses are things that Infosys was building internally.  However, generative AI varies for enterprise use cases versus publicly available models such as ChatGPT.  “If your engine is going to rely on public signals, generative AI will give you those public signals readily consumable. I don't need to create a brain and train it to consume signals from outside. But if I must build an engine, which will have to consume signals from an enterprise or its ecosystem, I still have to custom build it,” he said.  In addition, Satish said that they can provide their clients with their learnings, experimentation within the enterprise, and valuable insights.  This also means that a suite of services such as this will be priced at a premium — especially given their business model is also that there is better pricing in newer areas. He added that the revenue impact will be big, but it will take time to scale as people are experimenting and watching for clarity.  Use cases and concerns  Satish sees three established use cases. “This has the ability to deliver a new class of solutions and business models, which are ecosystem led, or it has the ability to disrupt your business processes so that they're more intelligent and sentient, or your people become more empowered or productive,” he said.  Satish said that generative AI has led to a 30 percent reduction in the effort required for analytics work.  However, this doesn’t mean that generative AI doesn’t come with its problems, the fact that they hallucinate or that safety and security of information may be a concern, among others.  To tackle this, Satish said, “One, the quality of data must be curated, especially in regulated areas. Second, we have to build explain-ability and traceability and we have to have humans in the loop.”  People and jobs  Satish said that Infosys already has a large data, analytics, and AI team that needs to learn incremental skills. The company is now focusing on prompt engineering.  “We have to help the average or the real user learn to use this technology. They need to understand at least some parts of nuances of prompt engineering — how to leverage the technology, when to use it, when not to use it. We have heard examples of people who have , inadvertently leaked out competitive data. You have to be very clear in classification of data assets within the organization, where you can use public domain large language models, where you use narrow transformer model, or an internally trained transformer model, which is specific to the enterprise,” he said.  Will jobs become redundant?  From the time ChatGPT exploded onto the scene, there has been chatter about what kind of, and how many jobs it can make redundant.  Satish said that he doesn’t see an immediate impact, given the generations of technologies that have come before. With generative AI, he said can solve higher order problems  “We are getting better at asking the right questions, framing the problem. Over a period of time that somebody said, this is the century of right brain people, a lot of us in our jobs will have a higher portion of design and reimagining what we do, which is essentially built in. The consulting industry is going to be democratized with this because knowledge is democratised,” he says.  He maintained that it will not immediately reduce headcount, but over a period, learning will change and help people become more productive.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/infosys-unveils-ai-first-offering-topaz-sees-huge-interest-from-clients-10645231.html
infosys,2023-05-22T13:12:49+05:30,Christin Mathew Philip,"Flooded underpasses, potholes and live wires: Bengaluru's infrastructure nightmare continues","Bhanurekha K, an Infosys employee, died after the car she was travelling in was submerged in an underpass at KR Circle, less than a kilometre away from the Vidhana Soudha, the seat of power","A 22-year-old techie's death in a flooded underpass in Bengaluru on May 21 has once again placed the spotlight firmly on the abysmal infrastructure of the country's tech capital.  Every year, rains open up death traps throughout the city, leaving citizens chancing with danger and possible death. Sunday's tragic incident also highlights the disturbing civic apathy that persists, costing lives.  The victim, Bhanurekha K, an employee of Infosys, died after the car she was travelling in was submerged in an underpass at KR Circle, located less than a kilometre away from the Vidhana Soudha, the seat of power. It's also where, ironically, the words of Kengal Hanumanthaiah, the second chief minister of Mysore state (now Karnataka), &quot;Government work is God's work,&quot; are engraved in Kannada and English.  Bhanurekha, a resident of Electronic City, had rented a car for her family members who were visiting from Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. Sadly, they got to experience the city's crumbling infrastructure and their trip quickly turned into an unforgettable nightmare.  Siddaramaiah, who was sworn in as the new chief minister on May 20, visited the hospital where Bhanurekha’s kin were being treated and announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for the victim's family. Former CM Basavaraj Bommai said the new government should issue strict orders to officials of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), the city’s civic body, to make necessary arrangements to prevent rain-related damage.  BBMP chief commissioner Tushar Girinath said barricades are usually placed at such underpasses with the assistance of traffic police to prevent access to vehicles when there is heavy rainfall. He added that the recent incident occurred due to heavy rain within a short period of time.   Karnataka's deputy CM DK Shivakumar, minister Ramalinga Reddy along with BBMP chief commissioner Tushar Giri Nath at the underpass on May 21.  Ananda Gundurao, a member of Bangalore Political Action Committee (B PAC), a citizens’ body advocating for better administration and infrastructure in the city, expressed his concerns, tweeted: &quot;Rains claim the season's first victim as a girl from a neighboring state loses her life in a flooded underpass. Many broken/blocked footpaths, open drains are waiting for their victims. This won't stop unless the Govt officers are held accountable &amp;amp; prosecuted.&quot;  Also read: Infosys techie drowns after car gets stuck in Bengaluru underpass after heavy shower  Comparisons between the excellent drainage system at Chinnaswamy Stadium, which ensured that the crucial Royal Challengers Bangalore-Gujarat Titans match on May 21 was not disrupted, and the complete lack of it outside, have been flying thick and fast.  In 2017, the Karnataka State Cricket Association implemented a subsurface aeration and vacuum-powered drainage project costing Rs 4.25 crore, which allows for discharge of accumulated water at the stadium within minutes. Sanjay Swamy, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist, tweeted, &quot;Isn't it ironic - Bangalore has the BEST drainage inside the stadium and the WORST outside the stadium.&quot;  Karthik Srinivasan, a communications strategy consultant, wrote on Twitter, &quot;My God! Death inside a car, in a flood inside a metro city should count as a monumental failure in town planning and management.&quot;  Tinu Cherian Abraham, a social media influencer, said, &quot;Even going out on a rainy evening in Bengaluru has become terrifying. There is no guarantee of returning home safely. Daytime is no exception, with the risk of falling into a pothole or on a broken footpath. Corruption and mismanagement have rendered this once beautiful city unliveable.&quot;  Ashwin Mahesh, an urban planner and Aam Aadmi Party leader, criticised the repeated failures in infrastructure development, saying, &quot;Despite years of promising to transform Bengaluru's infrastructure to match that of Singapore, we continue to witness the construction of notorious underpasses. They fail to meet the basic engineering standards required for public projects.&quot;  Underpasses death traps during monsoon  Underpasses have proven to be death traps during the monsoon in Bengaluru. According to BBMP records, the city has 28 underbridges. Many of these frequently get flooded, even with short spells of rain, due to poor design and lack of drainage systems. Additionally, South Western Railway maintains several rail underbridges in the city. Although both agencies claim to conduct regular audits of underpasses, they do not disclose the findings of these assessments. Despite the existing issues with underpasses, BBMP plans to add four more underpasses this year.  In 2008, BBMP introduced the concept of a 'magic box' underpass at the Cauvery Theatre junction on Ballari Road as a quick-fix traffic solution. The magic box is a prefabricated structure, which was to be installed within 72 hours, but it ended up taking 35 days. This model was replicated in other areas, but it faced criticism for failing to solve the underlying problems and instead exacerbating traffic congestion in those areas.  Potholes also pose significant dangers on Bengaluru's roads, leading to tragic incidents. Last year, a 38-year-old woman named Sharmila lost her life in a pothole-related accident on Magadi Road. She fell from her scooter while trying to avoid a pothole, and a vehicle coming from behind ran her over.  The hasty road laying before the polls and the lack of maintenance further contribute to the risks, posing a threat to life and limb. Between 2014 and 2021, there were 269 officially reported pothole-related deaths in Karnataka, with the majority occurring in Bengaluru. It is worth noting that such cases are often under-reported. Those using two-wheelers are particularly vulnerable to accidents caused by potholes.  Electrocution incidents also add to the dangers faced by Bengaluru residents. Last year, a 30-year-old man died of electrocution near Hebbal after accidentally coming into contact with an illegally drawn live wire attached to an advertisement hoarding.  Lack of elected city council adds to infrastructure woes  The new state government that assumed office on May 20 faces the enormous challenge of addressing the city's crumbling infrastructure, which is laid bare every monsoon. With potholes, flooded underpasses, broken or missing pavements, and live wires posing threats to residents' safety, experts emphasize the need to tackle these urgent issues. Bengaluru currently lacks an elected civic council, further exacerbating the situation and leaving residents without proper channels to address their civic concerns.  The BBMP council's term expired in September 2020, and since then, the city administration has been run by bureaucrats.  Although Bharatiya Janata Party, which was in power in the state, secured 16 out of 28 assembly seats in Bengaluru, the Congress party, which now governs the state, seeks to make significant inroads. Additionally, parties like the Aam Aadmi Party and Bengaluru NavaNirmana Party are aiming to make their presence felt in the civic polls. However, the question of when these elections will take place remains unanswered.  The BBMP has already identified over 200 flood-prone areas in the city. BBMP commissioner Girinath had assured that stormwater drainage cleaning would be carried out by the end of April and in May before the monsoon arrived in June. However, 3 cm rain on May 21 exposed the shortcomings of the civic body, with reports of waterlogging and fallen trees across the city. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), rains are expected to continue until May 27.  Sources indicate that citizens may face difficulties due to poor monsoon preparedness, as civic officials were preoccupied with the assembly elections for the past two months. &quot;Elections and the Model Code of Conduct have impacted monsoon preparedness work, leaving only two weeks before the onset of the monsoon,&quot; said a BBMP source.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/flooded-underpasses-potholes-and-live-wires-bengalurus-infrastructure-nightmare-continues-10636401.html

Murty, 72, discussed everything from Bollywood movies to her first meeting with husband Narayana Murthy to the casual classism she has been subjected to. Here are five things the author, philanthropist and former chairperson of Infosys Foundation revealed on the comedy talk show.  When Sudha Murty was called ‘behenji’ at London airport  Sudha Murty, among one of the richest people in India, revealed that she was once subjected to casual classism by two women who judged her based on her attire. The incident occurred when Murty was at the London airport to catch a flight to Bengaluru. She had a business class ticket and was dressed in a salwar kameez.  “I was at the Heathrow airport in a salwar kameez. I had a business class ticket and was standing in the queue,” she said on The Kapil Sharma Show. “They (two co-passengers) felt that if you wear a saree or a salwar kameez, you are a didi or behenji,” said Murty.  “They said, ‘Behenji, this is not your queue. The economy (queue) is that side. You should wait there,” she elaborated. Murty, the wife of Infosys billionaire Narayana Murthy, decided to feign ignorance and remained in the queue for business class.  Her co-passengers reacted poorly. The women allegedly said, “They are cattle class people” while referring to Murty. You can read more about the incident here.  How she met Narayana Murthy  Iss weekend raat 9:30 baje, #SonyEntertainmentTelevision par #TheKapilSharmaShow mein, Kappu ke ghar aane wali hain teen aisi hastiyaan, jinhonein humaare desh ka naam roshan kiya!@KapilSharmaK9 @sumona24 #RaveenaTandon #SudhaMurthy #GuneetMonga #TKSS pic.twitter.com/hd5ickz8gG — sonytv (@SonyTV) May 8, 2023   Sudha Murty also spoke about her first meeting with Narayana Murthy, whom she came to know through a friend. She said that her colleague at the time, named Prasanna, would bring her books which had Narayana Murthy’s name written on them, along with the names of places like Istanbul and Peshawar.  “Mujhe laga ye Narayana Murthy international bus conductor he kya? (I wondered if this Narayana Murthy is some international bus conductor)” she joked.  Murty also spoke of her surprise when she first saw the man she would go on to marry someday. “Mujhe laga ekdum film hero ke jaisa handsome Narayana Murthy... dashing. When he opened the door mujhe laga ye kaun he aadmi, chhota bachha? (I thought he would look as handsome and dashing as a film hero but when he opened the door I was like who is this young child?),” she quipped.  Sudha Murty’s letter to JRD Tata  The Padma Bhushan awardee also recalled an instance she has spoken about several times in the past. When Sudha Murty was doing her MTech in 1972, she saw a notice advertising a job opening at TELCO. The position was open only to male students and asked women students not to apply.  “It really made me angry. I was 23 years old, you tend to get angry more at that age,&quot; Murty recalled. She decided to write a letter to JRD Tata.  &quot;In my letter I wrote to him, ‘Sir, JRD Tata, when country was not independent that time your group started chemicals, locomotive, iron and steel industry, you are always ahead of time. In this society there are 50-50% men and women, if you don’t give an opportunity to women then you are cutting off the services of women, that means your country will not progress. If women don’t get an education and job opportunities, then a society or a country never rises, and this is one mistake of your company (for not allowing women students to apply for the job at TELCO, Pune)’,” Murty said.  The impact of the letter was such that TELCO removed the no-women policy and Murty herself went on to work for the company.

He is fit to do Bajrangi Bhaijaan. I enjoy movies,” she said.  The now-famous Downing Street incident  PM Rishi Sunak’s mother-in-law, billionaire Sudha Murthy has said that a UK immigration officer refused to believe that she was staying at 10 Downing Street on a visit to London last year. She told @KapilSharmaK9 the officials thought she was joking. pic.twitter.com/wd9psXpsFL — Shilpa (@shilpakannan) May 17, 2023  Perhaps Sudha Murty’s most famous revelation on the popular show was about her UK trip where she put 10, Downing Street as her address, much to the astonishment of airport officials.  She said that airport officials in the UK refused to believe she is the mother-in-law of UK PM Rishi Sunak. Narayana and Sudha Murty’s daughter, Akshata Murty, is married to Sunak.  “Once when I had gone [to the UK], they asked me my residential address. ‘Where are you staying in London?’ My elder sister was with me and I thought should I write '10 Downing Street'. My son also lives there (in UK), but I didn’t remember his complete address. But I finally wrote 10 Downing Street,” Murty recalled.  Murty said that the immigration officer looked at her incredulously and asked, &quot;Are you joking?!&quot; She responded, &quot;Nahi, sachchi bolti hu&quot; (No, I am telling you the truth).",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/sudha-murty-on-the-kapil-sharma-show-downing-street-address-jrd-tata-letter-10613641.html

The billionaire couple has been spotted travelling around Bengaluru in their old Maruti Alto and eschewing chartered jets for commercial flights. In fact, one incident involving Narayana Murthy on a commercial flight came to light when a Twitter user recalled his encounter with the Infosys co-founder.  Anindya Chatterjee, CEO of Saleswah CRM, said he sat next to Narayana Murthy on a flight from Singapore to Hong Kong in the early 2000s.  Chatterjee said that both he and Murthy were seated in the business class section of the flight. The founder of Infosys apparently had no airs and graces about him – for the flight attendant failed to recognise him. In fact, she even acted brusquely when Murthy requested that his jacket be taken away.  “NM and me was on the same flight Sin-Hkg sector.

The payout will be given along with the salary for May. While the average payout is 60 percent, an employee’s final variable payout will depend on their unit or department’s guidelines, and varies for different pay grades and departments.  In Q1FY23, Infosys had lowered variable payout to 70 percent, which was then reduced to 65 percent in Q2.  “While FY23 was a year of strong performance overall, the quarter that went by was impacted by a volatile market and unforeseen events,” an email sent to employees, as seen by Moneycontrol, said.  The company said in its email to employees that it must remain vigilant to changes in the market, and must see the current climate as an opportunity to “rally as a group and remain committed to navigating the changing business landscape”.  “We have always been a resilient organization, responding to market disruptions effectively and striving to move ahead,” it told employees.  Queries sent to Infosys were unanswered till the time of publishing.  Infosys had missed its guidance for the year in revenue growth after it reported the numbers for Q4, posting a full-year growth of 15.4 percent when its guidance was at 16-16.5 percent. Revenue in Q4FY23 came in at $4,554 million, a decline of 2.2 percent in reported terms and 3.2 percent in constant currency terms.  The IT major has guided for revenue growth of 4-7 percent in FY24, making this the first time since FY18 the company’s revenue will be in this guided range.  Infosys had said there was a one-time impact on revenue due to volume, but was also “a combination of cancellations and specific client issues”.  Cross-town rival Wipro’s Chief Human Resources Officer Saurabh Govil had said during the company’s earnings call that overall, the company’s variable payout would be above 80 percent.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/infosys-slashes-avg-variable-payout-for-q4fy23-to-60-10611281.html

Appearing on “The Kapil Sharma Show”, Murty, who is married to Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murthy recalled her airport experience while returning to Bengaluru from London.  “I was at the Heathrow airport in a salwar kameez. I had a business class ticket and was standing in the queue,” she said in Hindi when actor Archana Puran Singh, a judge on the show, asked her about the encounter.  “They (two co-passengers) felt that if you wear a saree or a salwar kameez, you are a didi or behenji.”  “They said, ‘Behenji, this is not your queue.

Deeksha Pandey, who belongs to Lucknow, wrote a LinkedIn post detailing the five things that helped her land interview calls at some prestigious companies and finally led to a job at Google.  The first thing Pandey did was subscribing to the career pages of more than 100 companies. This way, whenever a new position opened up and the company posted about it, she would receive an email notification. This allowed her to apply for hundreds of jobs without combing through several career pages every day to look for new openings.  The second step in her job search was participating in hiring contests. “I participated in almost all of the hiring contests organised frequently by multiple companies. Some popular sites that regular conducts these contests are: Hackerearth, D2C etc,” she wrote.    She also participated in several hackathons or short-term social coding events which indirectly led to interview calls. She also gave an example: “I participated in Microsoft Fixathon by Microsoft that eventually helped me in getting interview call from Microsoft.”  The fourth thing Pandey did was something all job seekers, not just the ones in tech, can apply to their job search. Before applying for an opening, she modified her CV according to the job description. “Before submitting my resume to any job opening, I used to trim my resume according to the job description. I tried to highlight/add the keywords in my resume that was in sync to the job description,” she wrote.  Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, Pandey never gave up. She received hundreds of rejection letters but that did not stop her from applying to new job openings. “Don’t get demotivated if you are not getting any reply from the companies. Just keep applying, you never know which could be the one for you.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/how-hyderabad-techie-got-interview-calls-from-google-microsoft-amazon-infosys-and-goldman-sachs-10596821.html

The purpose of the schemes is to retain and motivate talented and critical employees and to increase shareholder value as a reward for their performance.  &quot;This is to inform that the Company has allotted 5,11,862 equity shares on May 12, 2023, pursuant to the exercise of Restricted Stock Units by eligible employees,&quot; Infosys said in an exchange filing on May 14.  Of the total shares allotted to the employees, 1,04,335 units have been allotted under the 2015 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan and 4,07,527 equity shares have been allotted under the Infosys Expanded Stock Ownership Program of 2019.  The move also comes amid high attrition rate in the IT giant. Infosys ended Q4FY23 with 3,611 fewer employees than the preceding quarter, the company had announced. The company’s headcount growth for the year was 29,219, down 46 percent from last year’s net addition of 54,396.  With this, Infosys' headcount stood at 3,43,234 as of March 31, 2023. It was the first time since the Covid-hit quarter of FY21 that Infosys ended a quarter with fewer employees than it had at the end of the previous quarter.  Despite rising attrition, Infosys has committed to invest in talent. Fuelled by its learnings from the pandemic, the IT major's HR roadmap is focused on flexibility, talent creation and a positive employee experience, the company's HR head had mentioned.  The purpose of the 2015 Stock Incentive Compensation plan of Infosys is to attract, retain and motivate talented and critical employees, along with encouraging them to align individual performance with company objectives.  The Infosys Expanded Stock Ownership Program, 2019, on the other hand, plans to increase shareholder value, by expanding employee ownership of the company, in order to incentivise, retain and attract key talent through this performance based stock grant program.

Foreign investors reduced its stake in Infosys, India’s second largest software services firm, to 43.08 percent from 44.57 percent in the sixth straight quarter of divestment, according to latest shareholding pattern. FII holding in the country's largest software exporter, Tata Consultancy Services, was down to 12.72 percent in the March quarter from 12.94 percent in the tenth consecutive quarter of sell-off.  Other IT companies such as Tata Elxsi Ltd, Tech Mahindra Ltd, Zensar Technologies, LTIMindtree, Mastek, Mphasis, L&amp;amp;T Technology Services Ltd, Birlasoft, and Affle India Ltd, too recorded a steady decline in FII stakes over the previous quarter. While the pull-out from tech Mahindra continued for nine quarters in a row, Affle India suffered the bleeding for seven quarters.  The divestment by foreign investors weighed heavy on the quarterly earnings of the country's top IT companies with TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Tech, and Tech Mahindra, reporting weak financials that fell short of market expectations. They also expressed a lack of confidence in the near-term outlook, leading to a significant decline in net additions for fiscal 2023. The slump could be attributed to the ongoing crisis in US regional and European banks, as well as an unfavorable macroeconomic environment.  The sell-off has been worst in the March quarter with foreign institutional investors (FIIs) withdrawing around Rs 7,978 crore from the information technology sector, according to NSDL data.  Wipro Ltd and HCL Technology, however, bucked the trend as they reported a spurt in foreign funds flow. After seven consecutive quarters of reducing their stake in Wipro, foreign investors returned to the company in the March quarter, raising their stake to 8.77 percent from 8.67 percent. For HCL Tech, the FII holding increased to 18.92 percent from 18.29 percent sequentially.  Global brokerage house BofA recently predicted that the earnings growth could be at risk due to the global economic slowdown, particularly affecting the IT sector. As a result, it has stated that IT remains its top underweight, indicating a negative outlook for the sector.

This is significant as the Election Commission of India (ECI) had declared a holiday on polling day to increase voter participation, and yet the ECI received complaints from employees in IT-BT companies about a holiday not being granted.  Bengaluru district election officer Tushar Girinath told Moneycontrol that if companies do not declare a paid holiday on May 10, their Chief Executive Officers will be prosecuted.  &quot;All establishments are closed on May 10 to allow voters to vote anywhere in Karnataka. Any violation of this and a voter being denied the right by not giving him a paid holiday, the person will be liable to be prosecuted. We will prosecute the CEO of the company,&quot; Girinath said.  The state-wide paid holiday applies to all categories of employees including those working for the government, in public sector undertakings, banks, financial institutions, and private businesses.  The election is even being held on a Wednesday to push for higher voter turnout, as Bengaluru’s voter turnout is usually low. In fact, ECI records showed that IT clusters such as Bommanahalli, BTM Layout, KR Puram and CV Raman Nagar, coming under assembly constituencies, usually record low polling rates.  There is a polling percentage target of 65 percent for Bengaluru in this assembly election too by the Election Commission.  Karnataka will vote to elect legislators for 224 seats in the state Assembly, 28 of which are in Bengaluru, on May 10. Voting will take place from 7 am to 6 pm.

infosys,2023-05-02T13:54:28+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,"After a dismal Q4 amid macro challenges, what is in store for IT firms in FY24?",The year is set to be a challenging one for IT companies as pressure piles up on margins and clients demand pre-inflationary pricing   ,"Indian Information Technology (IT) companies experienced a dismal last quarter in the financial year ended March 2023 as they coped with challenges ranging from recession fears and high inflation to ripples from a banking crisis in the West.  The top five IT companies did report double-digit revenue growth in constant currency terms for the full fiscal year 2023.  Even so, it’s anyone’s guess how long the impact of a recession in the US and Europe and the banking crisis that has laid low Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse will continue to take its toll on an IT services industry that depends on banking and financial services for a major chunk of sales.  If we were to look at hiring as an indicator of demand, it doesn’t look too promising. After the pandemic-fuelled demand of the previous year, India’s top five companies reported a 65 percent slump in net additions to their workforce in FY23.  According to HFS Research Chief Executive Officer Phil Fersht, 2023, too, will be challenging although the industry is holding up well. Times will get tougher, he says, because of pressure on margins and clients demanding pre-inflationary pricing.  “The winners will be those that can win deals with performance pricing baked in and less focus on people costs,” he says.  How they fared in FY23   FY23 had started on a positive note and everyone in the IT industry was preparing for high growth and digital deals. At the time, the only concerns were the supply-side challenges and the Russia-Ukraine war, according to Pareekh Jain, founder and CEO of EIIRTrend. These supply-side challenges too eased.  “But in H2FY23 the challenges started coming in, first with tech company layoffs and then in the latest quarter, tech and BFSI sectors got hit,” Jain said. BFSI stands for Banking, Financial Services and Insurance. “Suddenly, there was oversupply in the market. All plans of hiring had to be stalled as more people were on the bench. And demand too started to subdue because of these banking and tech crises,” Jain said.  The fond hope had been that the fourth quarter of FY23 would be spared and the effects of the negatives would be visible only in FY24, but that wasn’t the case. At a time most segments of IT business were impacted, pockets such as engineering services did see growth, Jain said.  Ray Wang, CEO of Constellation Research, told Moneycontrol that despite the slowdown, IT services firms that can move the quickest will do the best.    Highlighting company-specific concerns, Wang said Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported its slowest revenue growth in 11 quarters, with a number of projects deferred to the new quarter.  Infosys reported weaker-than-expected Q4 numbers that missed analyst estimates and HCL Technologies, Wang said, showed “some sales finesse in winning 13 large deals.”  Wipro, Wang said, was “doing better with large deals and the horizontal realignment strategy to service cloud, data and analytics, bio, product engineering, infrastructure services and consulting.”  Tech Mahindra, which reported a drop from 12 percent in Q3 to 9.6 percent in Q4 margins, is in the midst of a crisis, Wang said.  “They have had a tough time retaining talent and keeping clients. The company really needs the big deal expertise of [CEO designate] Mohit [Joshi] as well as his diplomatic skill in working with clients and inspiring the staff,” he said.    In a tough spot  Leadership teams at all IT companies have sounded a note of caution, some more than others, as the stress becomes evident. Deal ramp downs have been seen across the board as well as delays in decision-making by clients.  Fersht told Moneycontrol: “We’re seeing customers aiming to slim down their providers massively. Some of these large deals (on vendor consolidation) are very resource-demanding, especially in the first couple of years. They can be very complex, and it’s hard to envisage exactly what’s needed during the RFP [request for proposal] process,” he said . Wang said that the macro conditions were part of a temporary three-to-six-month slowdown to pause general IT spending.  “However, projects that are related to optimisation, regulatory compliance and modernisation are still being prioritized. Pressure on Europe and APAC (Asia-Pacific) continues to hamper growth. Middle East remains a highlight along with the ANZA (Australia and New Zealand) and the Indian market. North America is slowing down, but continues to be a growth market,” Wang said.  Guidance for year ahead   Guidance by companies such as Infosys, Wipro and HCLTech hasn’t been promising. For FY24, Infosys has guided for revenue growth of 4-7 percent in constant currency. And HCLTech has guided for revenue growth of 6-8 percent in constant currency terms, down from 12-14 percent in FY23. Wipro, on the other hand, which guides for the following quarter, has guided for a -3 to -1 percent decline in revenue in constant currency terms.  CEO Thierry Delaporte told the press that the macro environment remains challenging looking ahead. “Our clients, our industry, and many sectors are impacted by the prolonged uncertainty in the economic environment. These headwinds are impacting our business and projections as well,” he said.  CFO Jatin Dalal, on the other hand, had told analysts hopes are that growth picks up in the second half, but the environment is still uncertain.  Experts have differed on a likely pick-up in demand in the second half of the year.  Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities said its view is that “the worst on the macro front is ahead of us and not behind us, and hence we think a 2HFY24 recovery in growth seems quite unlikely.”  Digital journey   Kotak Institutional Equities took a different approach. While macro uncertainties and the banking crisis in the US have impacted client sentiment on tech spending, leading to limited visibility on near-term demand, digital transformation is an ongoing journey “with most enterprises still in early stages,” it said.  According to Kotak, depending on the client-specific situation and the outlook of the industry segment they operate in, client priorities on spending would differ.  “Clients in the impacted verticals and those focusing on survival would prioritize lowering their cost base. On the other hand, the set of clients focused on strengthening their competitive positioning vis-à-vis peers would look to continue spending on transformation programs,” it said.  “In addition, given the current uncertain macro scenario, enterprises might also favour to bundle upfront cost-takeout mandates, followed by transformation into larger engagement while also consolidating the set of vendors they work with,” Kotak added in a note.  According to HFS’ Fersht, increased focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation will take centre stage in FY24 and believes some ambitious mid-sized providers can fare well because they can be nimble.  “The Tier 1s have to be wary of large vendor consolidation deals that could prove unprofitable and resource-draining,” he said. According to him, these mega deals created “huge resource headaches for service providers in many ways.”  Wang concurs on the AI front and says automation and AI were working hand-in-hand.  Reducing human interaction   “Every customer is finding ways to automate and reduce human interaction and also find exponential opportunities with AI,” he said. The focus is on contract negotiations, cloud optimization, code refactoring, and in some cases a move back to on-premises workloads.  “Customers are asking vendors to renegotiate deals with software vendors and services firms. A focus is on consolidating software vendors and optimizing overall IT service spend,” he said.  On the way forward, Wang says we can expect the slowdown to continue for the first two quarters, before picking up in late Q3. “Companies have many projects in cloud, analytics, automation, AI, and cybersecurity that must be completed in order to achieve operational efficiency and exponential growth,” he said.  UnearthInsight founder Gaurav Vasu says that in FY24, deal wins in areas such as cloud transformation, digital transformation and AI and verticals such as pharma, healthcare and life sciences will continue.  “We will still continue to see a few large deals. In FY24, a lot of deal renewals are coming up. These renewals will be a big push for the industry. You will see selective large companies offering end-to-end solutions will continue to win large deals. But overall, in FY24 and Q1FY25, deals will mostly be small. Weakness in BFSI will continue for some time. Growth overall in FY24 will be slower,” Vasu said.  Supply-side   The dwindling net headcount addition numbers have already given an indication of the times to come. Analysts expect hiring to be under pressure.  Vasu says that both gross hiring and net headcount additions are expected to return to their pre-pandemic levels.  He anticipates that companies will go back to pre-pandemic behaviour of internally rotating and fulfilling roles. “New tech-skills-based roles will require backfilling and new hiring. For some of the companies, given the huge hikes being paid out to new employees and large scale hiring, employee cost was about 65-70 percent of the wage bills of some of the IT companies; that’s getting normalised,” he said.  In FY24, he added, IT services companies will look to normalise the big cost element and look to quality hiring.  “We estimate the IT services industry will hire close to 8,00,000-9,00,000 on a gross basis and the entire industry will hire between 2,00,000-2,12,000 people in FY24,” he said.  According to Unearthinsight, in FY23, the gross hiring that also included people jumping from one company to another was around 7,50,000 to 9,00,000.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/after-a-dismal-q4-amid-macro-challenges-what-is-in-store-for-it-firms-in-fy24-10513291.html
infosys,2023-05-01T10:22:15+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,IT and ChatGPT: Generative AI gains ground among India's top IT firms,"While there is demand for generative AI-based solutions, companies are also worried about its implications. This has already led some firms to regulate its use, or ban the technology entirely","While the IT industry disappointed with its weak earnings and an uncertain outlook, there is one sunny patch in the sector. All IT firms are betting big on generative artificial intelligence (AI). Top companies, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and Tech Mahindra have been actively sharing their plans and outlook on the big AI opportunity.  In simple terms, AI is the ability of machines to perform certain tasks like translating languages, analysing data (text, audio, video, code, etc), etc., somewhat like human beings but at a larger scale. Generative AI, specifically, refers to producing new content, code, synthetic data, etc., either automatically (based on a programme, e.g.) or based on a prompt (text or image, e.g.) given by the user.  Unlike the  unrealised potential of the metaverse, senior industry executives told Moneycontrol that AI has gone beyond the exploratory stages . In fact, in a challenging macro-environment where the focus is shifting to cost efficiency, companies like Tech Mahindra are helping clients save millions by integrating existing AI tools in their operations, as well as building new solutions.  NG Subramaniam, Chief Operating Officer, TCS, mentioned during the company’s earnings call that generative AI was already a revenue-generating vertical. He said, &quot;In my interactions with clients over the last quarter, the conversation starts and stops with ChatGPT and what it's going to do.”  Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said that his company has active projects that use generative AI platforms to address specific areas of the client’s business.  “We have trained open-source generative AI platforms on our internal software development libraries. We expect generative AI to provide more opportunities to work with our clients, and also to help us improve our own productivity,” he said.  As for Accenture, its plan to expand AI and data capabilities included acquiring Bengaluru-based industrial AI company Flutura in March.  “We are acquiring Flutura to strengthen our industrial AI services, and to improve the performance of plants, refineries, and supply chains of our clients in the energy, chemicals, metals, mining, and pharmaceutical industries. It will also enable our clients to achieve their net zero goals faster,” Pranav Arora, MD and Lead – Applied Intelligence, Accenture India, told Moneycontrol.  “By ushering in a new era of enterprise intelligence, generative AI has the potential to transform business tasks and functions, from customer service and knowledge management, to creative production and scientific research, across virtually every industry,” Arora added.  These IT companies are already partnering with Google, Microsoft, and Microsoft-backed OpenAI (which developed ChatGPT), as the battle to gain market share for deploying generative AI solutions globally intensifies.  Many of the abovementioned IT firms are  engaged in building and customising enterprise level  solutions using the tools offered by these tech giants.  What’s in the offing?  TCS is currently working on  both the solutions and the consulting front. The solutions  include  AI-powered financial advisory and wealth management solutions for the BFSI sector, a virtual fashion designer for the retail industry, computer vision for heavy industries, and AI-driven streaming data analytics for anomaly detection,  among others.  Nidhi Srivastava, Vice President and Global Head of Google Business Unit, TCS, which is working on developing AI solutions on top of Google’s tools, said, “We are also exploring cross-industry solutions to enhance productivity through automated code generation, content creation, copywriting, and marketing.”  On the services side, TCS is building service offerings and delivery capabilities that can accelerate the implementation of AI-based solutions for clients. “We have also created an `AI Factory‘ to expand AI adoption in enterprises,” Srivastava said.  For Wipro, it’s been over two years since it established the Generative AI Centre of Excellence (CoE) to work with technology partners and academic institutions driving research in advanced areas of AI.  Mukund Kalmanker, VP &amp;amp; Global Head, AI Solutions, Wipro, told  Moneycontrol,  “Wipro is engaged in many client conversations ranging from  AI-assisted decision making to designing new-age digital experiences, to transforming processes across business functions and modernising IT systems and infrastructure.”  He added that customers from sectors like banking, insurance, energy, retail, consumer goods, life sciences, healthcare, telecom, etc., are interested in leveraging AI.  Tech Mahindra too is working on many projects and developing solutions in the AI and Intelligent Automation (IA) space. It is assisting enterprises in meeting demand  and improving efficiency.  Kunal Purohit, Chief Digital Services Officer, Tech Mahindra, said, “We help enterprises save millions with computer vision-based  asset inspection solutions, crowdsourcing (data, etc.), conversational AI, anomaly detection, Document AI or low-code/no-code solutions like Vision AI Workbench, Forecasting Workbench, etc.”  For instance, using their Smart Assistant solution that classifies all incoming email, Tech Mahindra improved data accuracy by 90 percent and reduced human effort by 60 percent for an insurance claims company,  delivering a 6X increase in the ROI on support cost, Purohit said.   How top IT firms are leveraging generative AI  Need for AI talent  AI is becoming an essential part of digital transformation strategies for businesses across industries, and it will continue to evolve and become more accessible, according to Purohit. To capture this opportunity, IT companies will need reliable and skilled talent to develop solutions.  Wipro’s Kalmanker said the company has a robust enterprise-wide AI talent management plan in place, which includes both hiring talent as well as a well-developed AI curriculum to train employees at the Wipro AI Academy.  “Our approach also includes scholarships for Ph. Ds at globally renowned academic institutions. These are for research programmes that attempt to solve complex business problems through innovations in generative AI,” he added.  According to Srivastava, there will be a big demand for AI talent across levels including  strategists, solution architects, implementation specialists, model developers, model trainers, training data preparers, and end-to-end ML (machine learning) lifecycle specialists, to name a few.  “While hiring will be a channel for talent acquisition, there will be equal, if not more focus on talent up-skilling and cross-skilling. This will help retain contextual organisational knowledge while ensuring viable labour economics,” Srivastava said, speaking of TCS’ plans.  Concerns on privacy and cyber security  Companies like TCS are also exploring the use of generative AI to assist their own employees, though cyber security risks remain a concern.  In an earlier interaction with Moneycontrol, TCS CHRO Milind Lakkad had said, “We are looking into what generative AI means in the context of an enterprise, not just from the standpoint of what the operating model will be, but also what will be the role of an employee versus the role of an AI co-worker.”  He had added that with generative AI being used, there are also discussions underway about safeguarding intellectual property (IP), security, etc. With AI bots like ChatGPT, there are concerns about the code (the IP) getting leaked when auto-generating code, or malicious code getting created.  “With new tools come new concerns and security risks. High on the list of concerns for cybersecurity practitioners is the possibility that ChatGPT could be used to generate malicious code. This means many more people could create malware, potentially leading to many more attacks and breaches,” Infosys said in a blog post.  While there is demand for generative AI-based solutions, companies are also worried about its implications. This has already led some firms to regulate its use, or ban the technology entirely.  Firms like Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo have banned ChatGPT across their offices globally.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/it-and-chatgpt-generative-ai-gains-ground-among-indias-top-it-firms-10505091.html
infosys,2023-04-28T14:45:52+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,"India's top 5 IT companies added 83,906 employees in FY23, compared to 2.73 lakh in the previous year","TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra have all experienced net headcount reductions during one of the quarters. Wipro and Tech Mahindra have both seen a reduction in headcount for two consecutive quarters – in Q3 and Q4. ","India's top five IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra — added 83,906 employees in FY23, a 69 percent decline from the previous year's addition of 2,73,377 employees. Among the five companies, only HCLTech added new employees in each quarter of the fiscal year. The earnings season was lackluster, with mixed or muted results and cautious outlooks for the next quarter, given the prevailing macroeconomic conditions.  Net additions and hiring are indicators of demand. However, companies say that their utilisation is low and attrition is falling, which suggests that they have room to grow and do not need to hire as aggressively.  TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra have all experienced net headcount reductions during one of the quarters. Wipro and Tech Mahindra have both seen a reduction in headcount for two consecutive quarters – in Q3 and Q4.    According to company executives, the talent market is cooling down and returning to where they were prior to the pandemic years. FY22, in particular, has been termed as an aberration when it comes to net addition, and experts say companies will move closer to their net addition levels pre-pandemic.  This is already starting to show up, as FY23's net addition figure is closer to that of FY21's net addition of 86,685 employees.  Hiring was on a tear as a result of pandemic-induced demand, with a large number of freshers hired as well. Now, those numbers are being staggered for onboarding, but due to declining utilisation, some companies haven't committed to hiring numbers for Q4.  Tech Mahindra saw the steepest drop in headcount addition for the year, adding only 1,227 employees on a net basis, compared to 30,119 net additions last year. The company added 6,862 employees in Q1, 5,877 in Q2, went into the red by 6,844 employees in Q3, and saw another consecutive decline of 4,688 employees in Q4.  At the same time, the company has the lowest attrition rate among its peers, at 15 percent.  Harshvendra Soin, the company’s Chief Human Resources Officer, told analysts after the results on April 27 that the company’s internal fulfillment rates have increased substantially.    “Our focus is on upskilling, giving opportunities from within, and it has really worked out. Add to this the fact that our attrition is also the lowest among our peer set gives us a lot of confidence tha the strategy is working and folks are getting more opportunities internally so we don’t have to go out every single time,” he said.  Wipro is the other company that has seen a negative headcount reduction for two consecutive quarters. Speaking to the press on April 27, Chief Executive Officer Thierry Delaporte attributed the headcount decline in Q3 and Q4 to the large addition the company made in the first quarter of the fiscal — 15,446 employees on a net basis. (This fell to 605 in Q2, saw a decline of 435 in Q3 and another decline of 1,832 employees in Q4).  Delaporte said that high addition in Q1, lowering utilisation and impacting margins, was done knowing that the company would need them in later quarters. These people, he said, are being trained, onboarded and deployed.  “If you look at the evolution of the headcount, in a given quarter, you might not necessarily see this impact. The reality is that we will continue to hire, there is demand, we are growing in some areas, on some specific skills, where there's very high demand, and we need to continue to hire. At the same time, attrition is going down, so we need to take into that account. Finally, the fact that with our level of utilisation — which has improved over last few quarter — we see also that there's some room for improvement,” he said.  Wipro added 22,000 freshers during the year, which it said was the highest it has done so far.  Infosys, Wipro’s cross-town rival, saw a headcount decline of 3,611 during the last quarter of FY23. Its headcount addition for the year also fell along with attrition. It added 29,219 employees on a net basis in FY23, down from FY22’s 54,396. The company hired 51,000 freshers during the year. While it usually gives a target number for hiring for the year ahead, it did not do so this time.  During the company’s earnings press conference, Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy said that the softness in demand is what led to utilisation falling to 80 percent, and it expects this to increase gradually in coming quarters.  “We will calibrate the hiring for FY24 based on the available pool of employees, growth expectations and attrition trends.”  He added that they have a lot of people on the bench as well. “I think our model in terms of hiring has got enough flexibility to take care of new volumes. In any case, we have a rich bench, 80 percent utilisation is what we have, and usually, we have operated well above that,” he said.  Kotak Institutional Equities had said in its note that the headcount addition for FY24 could be tepid due to “limited demand visibility, significant headroom on utilisation, moderating lateral attrition and trainees becoming billable”.  HCLTech's net headcount dropped from 39,900 to 17,067 over the year, but it did manage to add employees each quarter, including over 25,000 freshers. “While we are scaling fresher intake, we still have an opportunity here. We will have sustained focus on this over the next two to three years to improve this further,” Chief Executive Officer C Vijayakumar said.  In FY24, the company targets to add 15,000 freshers which will be higher than the gross addition.  Lastly, TCS, which kicked off the earnings season, saw a marginal increase of 821 employees in Q4, following a reduction in headcount in Q3. Attrition has moderated to 20.1 percent as of Q4FY23, and it has been declining from peak levels. During FY23, the company added 44,000 freshers as well as their “highest ever number of experienced professionals during the year,” according to CHRO Milind Lakkad.  Apart from HCLTech, TCS is the only company that has stated how many freshers it plans to hire in FY24, having rolled out 46,000 offers.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/net-addition-by-indias-top-5-it-companies-falls-69-in-fy23-10495081.html

infosys,2023-04-25T15:46:22+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,"TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech record 65% decline in hiring as IT sector runs into a rough patch","TCS, HCLTech, and Infosys' net additions fell sharply year on year in Q4FY23, with only 884 employees added on a net basis compared to 68,257 in Q4FY22.","It's been a fiscal year of slowing net additions in each quarter, but India's top three IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and HCLTech — saw a steep drop in their net addition for the 2023 fiscal year — down cumulatively from 1.97 lakh to 68,886 — a 65 percent drop. This came as companies reported a dismal quarter and were not particularly optimistic about the near term due to the banking crisis in US regional banks and European banks, as well as the macroeconomic climate at large.  Hiring is considered an indicator of demand, and the stress was visible in Q4FY23. There was a 98.7 percent drop in the number of employees the three companies added on a net basis in Q4FY23 compared to the same period last year.    TCS, HCLTech, and Infosys added just 884 employees on a net basis in Q4FY23, compared to 68,257 in Q4FY22. Sequentially, the net addition of the three companies has fallen from 2,375 in Q3FY23.    TCS added 1,03,546 employees in FY22 on a net basis, which fell to 22,600 in FY23.  TCS Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad told analysts that the net addition numbers — 821 in Q4 and 22,600 for the full year — masks the full extent to which they ramped up talent acquisition.  In Q4FY23, TCS added 821 employees which is a significant drop from the 35,209 they added in Q4FY22.  “These numbers mask the full extent to which we had ramped up our talent acquisition during the year to cope with the unprecedented churn in the first half of the year.” Lakkad is referring to the company’s attrition numbers while talking about churn.  The company’s attrition reached 21.5 percent on a last-twelve-month (LTM) basis in Q2FY23, and has moderated to 20.1 percent in Q4. From its peak, TCS’ quarterly annualised attrition is down 10 percent, and expects attrition to return to pre-pandemic levels by the second half of the fiscal.  Lakkad said they onboarded over 44,000 freshers, as well as their “highest ever number of experienced professionals during the year”. For the coming year, the company is looking to add 46,000 campus hires in FY24. He added that the number of lateral hires “will be dependent on the demand from the business every quarter.”  CEO Rajesh Gopinathan also said that it is difficult to call how long the current situation is likely to last, or how the near-to-medium will turn out to be, but that the company did bring down its lateral hiring.  “From an operational perspective, we have been tightening. We are well positioned to be able to react on either side. We had brought down our lateral hiring and our overall capacity addition, leveraging the strong investments that we had made in the last year. We are systematically using the return to normalcy on travel to reposition our employee base in North America, away from the short-term contingent labour back to our more stable employee-led delivery model,” Gopinathan said.  Infosys, on the other hand, saw its yearly net addition nearly halve to 29,219, from 54,396 last year. In Q4, it ended the quarter with 3,611 fewer employees than it had at the end of Q3. In comparison, the company added 21,948 employees on a net basis in the same period last year.  Chief Financial Offer Nilanjan Roy said that the company’s utilisation has declined to 80 percent due to softness in demand.  “We expect the utilisation to improve gradually in the coming quarters as freshers start getting deployed. We will calibrate the hiring for FY24 based on the available pool of employees, growth expectations and attrition trends,” he said. The company hired roughly 51,000 freshers in FY23, but refused to give any targets going ahead.  Roy also told reporters during a press conference after its Q4 results that they have a lot of benches, and they have kept this bench over a period of time and are ready to move into production. “I think our model in terms of hiring has got enough flexibility to take care of new volumes. In any case, we have a rich bench, 80 percent utilisation is what we have, and usually, we have operated well above that,” he said.  The company’s attrition declined to 20.9 percent on an LTM basis in Q4FY23, declining steeply in every quarter of the fiscal year. Roy said that quarterly annualised attrition has reduced by over 4 percent sequentially, is the lowest in the nine quarters, and is below pre-pandemic levels.  Kotak Institutional Equities said in its note that the headcount addition for FY24 could be tepid due to “limited demand visibility, significant headroom on utilisation, moderating lateral attrition and trainees becoming billable”.  HCLTech’s net addition for the year came in at 17,067, down from FY22’s 39,900. For Q4 too, it added 3,674 employees, as opposed to Q4FY22’s 11,100.  CEO C Vijayakumar said during the call with analysts that it had added 3,674 employees in Q4 and 4,480 freshers during the quarter, it is “lower than the last quarter, adjusting for the market conditions.”  “We've added more than 25,000 freshers in the year, the highest in our history. While we are scaling fresher intake, we still have an opportunity here. We will have sustained focus on this over the next two to three years to improve this further,” he added.  Ramachandran Sundararajan, chief people officer said that attrition has been a phenomenal story.  The attrition rate in Q4 stood at 19.5 percent on an LTM basis, decreasing significantly from 21.7 percent in the previous quarter and 21.9 percent in the same quarter last year.  In a note, Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities said that HCLTech indicated that lateral hiring would moderate in FY24, while fresher hiring is expected to continue with a target of hiring 15,000 freshers during the year.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hiring-in-indias-top-3-it-companies-drops-65-percent-in-fy23-from-last-year-10473401.html

Hailing from a family with roots in agriculture, a job with the software giant meant a stable income, but the happiness was short-lived when Vignesh decided to quit his job and take up farming. Now, two years since, the 27-year-old earns double the salary while working at a brinjal farm in Japan.  &quot;I have always been interested in agriculture,&quot; Vignesh, who is from Kovilpatti in Tamil Nadu's Thoothukudi district, told Moneycontrol. &quot;And it was during the lockdown that I got a chance to reconnect with my passion. I began to tend to my family's farms and soon realised that it was indeed my calling.&quot;  But Vignesh's family was not in favour of him earning a living out of agriculture. &quot;They said there is no money to be made here. And they wanted me to have a stable income,&quot; he said, and he soon found hope when he came to know of an opportunity in Japan.  &quot;I heard from a friend about an institute that trains people in Japanese language and culture before helping them find jobs in the country and I got myself enrolled,&quot; Vignesh said.  Chennai-based Nihon Edutech works in collaboration with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and trains skilled workers in Japanese language, culture, etiquette, and technical training to place them in Japan. The country's demand for farmers comes from its ageing population and its younger generation's disinterest in agriculture.  Six months later, Vignesh was ready, and in March, he flew to Japan to begin his stint as an agricultural worker at a brinjal farm in the country's Kochi prefecture.   Venkatasamy Vignesh celebrates a birthday party with other farm workers in Japan. (Image credit: Moneycontrol)  The former software engineer, who used to earn close to Rs 40,000 a month at Infosys, now earns around Rs 80,000 after deducting taxes. &quot;Here, I live in the company's quarters for free but have to take care of my food requirements,&quot; Vignesh told Moneycontrol over a call from Japan.  Explaining his role at the brinjal farm, he said that he has to take care of the crops and once they are ready, he helps in harvesting, cleaning, and processing it. &quot;There is a lot to learn from here,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of the work is mechanised which reduces manual labour.&quot;  When asked what he plans to do after his stint in the country, Vignesh said he intends to use his learnings to introduce innovate farming techniques in India.  Commenting on Vignesh's journey, CEO of Nihon Edutech Krishnan Narayanan said, &quot;He has done a great job, not only in setting a goal and achieving but has also helped a few of the others to go along (with him to Japan), helped and even been a leader to them.&quot;  Meanwhile, CII’s executive director Sougata Roy Choudhary believes it's a unique opportunity for Vignesh especially because he wants to return to India and use his experience to teach others about better farming practices. &quot;Japan has limited agricultural land and they practice intensive farming with the use of the latest equipment and technology. The techniques Vignesh learns there, he can implement in India so that the productivity per acre goes up,&quot; he said.  But in the end, when Vignesh was asked what his family feels about him farming brinjals in Japan, he replied with a laugh, &quot;They are okay now knowing that I am making more money than in my last job at Infosys while still working in the agricultural industry. They are also a little proud that I intend to return and share my experiences with them.&quot;  Read more: Can farming in developed countries become a feasible employment avenue for Indian youth?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/infosys-techie-quits-job-to-take-up-brinjal-farming-in-japan-earns-double-10461301.html

Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank were among the eight companies that suffered a decline in their valuation.

infosys,2023-04-21T16:06:35+05:30,Abhishek Mukherjee,"Weekly Wrap: Tech travails, BFSI prevails as market searches for direction","The March quarter earnings season has got off to a rocky start, with IT majors posting a sobering set of numbers amid the gathering clouds of recession in the West.","The March quarter earnings season has got off to a rocky start for investors, with IT majors posting a sobering set of numbers amid the gathering clouds of recession in the West, even as banking and financial firms put up a robust show thanks to resilient domestic demand.  The week began on an inauspicious note for Dalal Street after its nine-day rally juddered to a halt due to severe selling in the IT pack, led by Infosys.  The Infosys stock suffered ‘a rapid unscheduled disassembly’ (to borrow SpaceX’s terminology) on April 17 after the company’s dismal performance in the March quarter stunned investors.  The company was whiplashed by project cancellations, margin contraction and slowing order inflows triggered by the banking crisis in the US – the bread-and-butter market for India’s software services industry.  More worryingly, the Bengaluru-headquartered firm guided for revenue growth of just 4-7 per cent in 2023-24 (in constant currency terms). For context, its earlier guidance stood at 13-15 percent (for FY23) and 12-14 percent (FY22).  A few days earlier, India's biggest IT firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) too had disappointed the street with lower-than-expected numbers for the last quarter of FY23, leading to a barrage of target price cuts by brokerages.  Also Read: What makes the Q4 flop show a bigger pain for Infosys than for TCS?  “The outlook for TCS has been clouded by client caution driving cuts to discretionary tech spends,” JPMorgan noted.  In contrast, it is the smaller IT firms which have propped up morale with upbeat numbers.  HCL Technologies’ profit at Rs 3,981 crore beat estimates, even though revenue lagged behind the projections. (Read full story here).  “Although the outlook for FY24 is uncertain in the near term owing to the challenging macro environment, the resilient model, diverse portfolio mix, strong client additions, a strong deal pipeline and decent hiring makes HCL Tech well placed to navigate the uncertainty,” Sharekhan said.  &amp;nbsp;   Cyient too logged a healthy 48 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in consolidated revenue at Rs 1,751 crore, while net profit rose 5.5 percent to Rs 163 crore.  But there’s some grim news for investors ahead of the remaining IT results.  JPMorgan says the fourth quarter results of TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech highlight the weakness in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and telecom verticals.  &quot;We see Tech Mahindra and Mphasis get impacted, given their high exposure to both of these verticals,&quot; the broking firm wrote in a research note.  The commentary from the US too remains unsettling, with everyone from Warren Buffett to Nouriel Roubini and Jeremy Grantham recently cautioning investors that the US banking crisis is far from over.  There’s no stop loss on pain, after all.    &amp;nbsp;  BFSI Booster  Three things are certain in life – death, taxes, and HDFC Bank delivering around 20 percent growth in profits.  The country’s largest private-sector lender on April 15 reported a 20.6 percent growth in net profit at Rs 12,594.5 crore for the quarter ended March, while consolidated net revenue jumped by a similar margin to Rs 34,552.8 crore. (Full numbers here).  It performed well on most parameters – deposit growth, asset quality and capital adequacy – though the stock has not budged this week, maybe due to the overhang of the HDFC merger.  Analysts, however, remain bullish on the counter.  Most banks, in fact, had posted encouraging Q4 business updates, and the street is eyeing a good batch of earnings from this segment.  From the insurance pack, ICICI Prudential Life posted stellar figures, including a 27.2 percent jump in net income to Rs 235 crore for the March quarter on nearly record margins earned from new policies sold.  Brokerage CLSA said the strong fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2023 was supported by a pre-buying trend related to budget tax changes in March 2023, leading to a 27 percent increase in annualized premium equivalent (APE) and a consistently high margin of 32 percent.  In other news….    As if the challenging macro environment wasn’t enough, equity market participants were jolted by a news report, which claimed the government was mulling increases in capital gains taxes for top-income earners.  The Income Tax Department issued a swift rebuttal to calm nerves, but some investors still remain on the edge.  The underlying sense of bearishness was evident when Avalon Technologies sank nearly 9 percent on its market debut on April 18.  Mankind Pharma too managed to attract only a single-digit premium in the grey market on the day of its IPO price band announcement, demonstrating that the glory days of ‘irrational exuberance’ are behind us as of now.  Analysts have also flagged the expensive valuations and only offer-for-sale portion in the IPO as possible reasons for the low premium.  On the other hand, ITC woke up from its interminable slumber and how! The stock hit the Rs 400 milestone this week, catapulting the cigarettes-to-FMCG conglomerate to the elite club of Rs 5 trillion market capitalisation firms.  On April 20, ITC became the 11th listed Indian company to cross Rs 5 trillion market capitalisation after its shares touched a record high with a 21 percent surge so far this year.  ITC @ 400: A story of patience, payback, and a puff of smoke  Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services, HDFC Bank, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Life Insurance Corp of India, State Bank of India, HDFC and Bharti Airtel have earlier achieved this milestone.    ITC on April 21 briefly pipped even HDFC Ltd in terms of value, spreading more cheer among its faithful band of investors.

This is not the first time that Murthy expressed his views on Artificial Intelligence (AI) or ChatGPT. In March, while speaking on the sidelines of NASSCOM Technology and Leadership Forum 2023, Murthy described ChatGPT as a good thing. He detailed his rendezvous with the chatbot and said, &quot;I have used ChatGPT. My son introduced me to it a few months ago. It provides you with the knowledge and then you can use it further as per your creativity.&quot;  “If there is a competition between you and me, you will use the ChatGPT output as your base, and then you will add your own differentiation, your own smartness, your own tweaking,” continued Murthy. “And that’s when the teachers will be much more impressed with you than with me.”  In recent times ChatGPT, the AI chatbot, has created a lot of buzz in the tech sector. People fear that this technology is powerful enough to replace humans in the coming future, causing more job loss and making human skills irrelevant  “The lazy guys will get C. Only smart people will get A,” said Murthy. &quot;Even in 1977-78, there were programme generators that had come in and so everybody feared for jobs but that didn't happen. Because the human mind is the most flexible instrument. So, it was then used to help bigger problems with human creativity and tech together. And so, ChatGPT is a good one but we must use it as a base and then use it to show our creativity and solve bigger problems but be it ChatGPT or AI, it will never replace humans,&quot; he concluded.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/nothing-can-beat-the-human-mind-not-even-chatgpt-says-narayana-murthy-10451611.html

HCLTech reported its full year numbers on April 20.  The third largest IT services firm clocked in deal total contract value (TCV) worth $2.07 billion in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2022. This was an 8 percent drop on a YoY basis as compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. On a sequential quarter basis, this was a plunge of about 12 percent.  As of full year FY23, the company’s order book stood at $8.85 billion, up by 6 percent YoY, against $8.30 billion in FY22.  Deal wins came from across geographies, industries, and service lines. In terms of geographies, Europe grew the highest with 20.6% YoY in constant currency (CC) terms, Americas grew 14.4% CC while rest of the world grew 11% CC. Top performing verticals of the year were technology, telecom, and manufacturing.  “Last quarter we signed 13 large deals across products and services. We won a few large deals in Europe and the US in the financial services sector, which is a sign of our propositions in this market,” Vijayakumar said at the earnings conference call.  He added, “While there are some uncertainties in the system be it booking or ramp up deals delays, they are all on the discretionary spend side. For a lot of run-the-business tech we don’t see that much of stress. That gives us good confidence given our strengths in both transformative and operating spends.”  HCLSoftware business crossed an important milestone of earning $1 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR).  Speaking of outlook for FY24, he said, “I believe FY24 will be a year of consolidation both on the demand and supply side… Clients had accelerated tech spends in the last many quarters, it’s now time to review and consolidate to the most efficient and impactful technologies.”  Remains bullish in financial services  As of Q4, HCLTech got about 21.6 percent of its revenue from the financial services vertical. Vijayakumar continues remain bullish on this segment despite the ongoing global banking crisis with the collapse of US regional banks like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Swiss bank Credit Suisse among others.  He highlighted that only one percent of the company’s revenue has exposure to banks while insurance continues to remain an important segment with financial services.  He still throws an air of caution, saying, “I do think insurance, especially in the financial services segment are under cost pressures due to inflation and they are looking at bringing more efficiencies and automation to their operations. We are well positioned to leverage the opportunity, hence outlook to the segment remains solid.”  He added, “Amidst all the volatility, I want to say our financial services vertical continues to see good opportunities…And also it’s on the strength of both cloud and hybrid cloud adoption in the financial services sector where we have a strong play and that is helping, especially in the capital and insurance markets.”  HCLTech’s financial services vertical sequentially grew 6.9 percent, on the back of large deals the company executed very well and on time to convert it into revenue, Vijayakumar said.  Scope of generative AI  As rivals Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys spoke about their on goings and client conversations on generative artificial intelligence (AI), Vijayakumar too feels that for HCLTech, this technology could be one of the biggest opportunities where the company is trying to find the most impactful use cases for both operations and software development.  “This would also be helpful for building a lot of business use cases for our clients in different verticals.  So we have teams working across the board, building those use cases and proof points. Then we will benchmark that with the impact it would create, and clearly double on the high impact use cases,” he said.  Vijayakumar added, “I think it’s a very very strong opportunity. More than the technology itself, a lot of opportunity is there on how the technology can be applied in the real world business context. That’s what we are excited about.”  HCLTech reported its Q4FY23 numbers. Consolidated net profit for the quarter ended March 2023 stood at Rs 3,981 crore, up 10.61 percent against Rs 3,599 crore a year back.

","UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s wife Akshata Murty lost about $61 million (£49 million) on Monday after shares in Infosys fell by 9.4 percent, Bloomberg reported. Murty owns a 0.94 percent stake in the tech giant co-founded by her father Narayana Murthy.  Infosys's shares nosedived on Monday after its guidance painted a negative outlook for India’s technology sector, which led to a wave of downgrades by brokers. It was the company's biggest tumble since March 2020.  This, however, is only a fraction of the Sunak family's wealth as Akshata Murty’s stake in Infosys is still worth about Rs 6,000 crore.  While Rishi Sunak’s office declined to comment, Murty’s wealth has been a recurring theme in her husband’s political career. In 2022, Murty earned Rs 126.61 crore in dividend income from her shares in Infosys. It was also last year that the couple faced backlash after it emerged that Murty held non-domicile status in the UK and hadn’t been paying tax on overseas earnings.  At that time, her spokesperson had stated that as a citizen of India, she was unable to hold citizenship of another country and that &quot;she has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income.&quot;  As the controversy snowballed, she at that time announced that she would pay UK tax on all of her worldwide earnings out of a &quot;British sense of fairness&quot;.  Meanwhile, Sunak is facing a watchdog inquiry under his parliamentary declaration of interest obligations related to a Budget policy that could benefit his wife through her business interest in a childcare firm, it emerged on Monday.  While Sunak has stated that all his disclosures were &quot;declared in the normal way,&quot; the parliamentary watchdog's investigation will decide if there has been any breach of the code.

Unplanned ramp down of projects, delay in decision-making and some one-off revenue impacts, including a few clientspecific project cancellations, hit revenue growth in Q4, leading to the revenue-guidance miss. Mgmt highlighted weakness in parts of BFSI (mortgage, asset management, and investment banking), telecom, retail, and hi-tech which subdued growth. Among geographies, USA is more impacted than Europe. Infosys has guided for 4-7% YoY CC revenue growth for FY24, implying 1.7-2.9% CQGR over the next four quarters. After missing revenue growth guidance for FY23, Infosys is likely to guide conservatively for FY24, given increased caution in spending by clients and prevailing macro uncertainties; but the asking rate at the upper-end appears to be demanding and may require support of some mega-deal closures during FY24. Mgmt has guided for 20-22% EBITM for FY24 which is 100bps lower than the guided margin range at beginning-FY23. Despite near-term challenges posed by the tough macro environment, we believe Infosys is well positioned to capture the growth opportunities across digital transformation, cost efficiency and consolidation-led deals over the medium term. Outlook We cut our EPS by 4.4-6.3% for FY24E/25E, factoring-in the disappointing Q4. We maintain BUY on the stock, with revised TP of Rs1,620/share (earlier, Rs1,700) at 22x Mar-25E EPS.

Both the benchmark Sensex and the Nifty lost 1.2 percent each. The Sensex fell 728 points to 59,702 points, while the Nifty erased 182 points to 17,645 points around 11.20am on Monday.  Many brokerages have downgraded Infosys after its fourth quarter results disappointed the Street, and cut its target price. JP Morgan has lowered the stock to 'underweight' and cut its target price to Rs 1,200 from Rs 1,500 a share. CLSA cut its target price to Rs 1,550 from Rs 1,800, Citi kept its target price to Rs 1,400 from Rs 1,675 a share, Nomura Research target price was at Rs 1,290 from Rs 1,660, while Bofa cut its target price to Rs 1,390.  &quot;We believe FY24 will be a year of revenue growth disappointment. Increasing macroeconomic headwinds are likely to create challenges in terms of growth, as enterprises delay their decision-making and prioritise cost optimisation projects with upfront benefits, over transformation projects with back-ended returns,&quot; Nomura Research said in a recent report.  Let's take a look at the factors that drove the markets down today.  Slump in IT Stocks    The Nifty IT index slumped over 6 percent after tech behemoths Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd posted weak earnings for the March quarter. Infosys declined 11 percent, its steepest fall in three years, to hit over a one-year low, shaving off Rs 70,000 crore of investors' wealth. Many brokerages have downgraded the stock after Infosys said the sales growth will be just 4 percent to 7 percent this financial year because of client spending and uncertain demand environment due to failure of US banks.  Wipro and TCS lost 3 percent each, while LTIMindtree fell 8 percent respectively. Persistent Systems, L&amp;amp;T Technology Services, Coforge, Tech Mahindra, Mphasis and HCL Technologies declined up to 6 percent.  Fears of Further Rate Hike by Fed   Retail sales in the US for March have experienced a more significant than anticipated decline of 1 percent month-on-month, exceeding the predicted decrease of 0.5 percent on-month. A detailed analysis of the numbers indicates that consumers are restraining from making discretionary purchases.  However, the core retail sales (excluding auto and gas) declined less than anticipated during March. Despite the weaker retail sales figures and lower inflation prints (CPI and PPI), the markets are now pricing in an 80 percent probability of a 25bps hike in May's policy, up from the previous week's 70 percent, according to analysts.  This shift in market expectations is due to remarks made by Fed member Waller, who expressed support for tightening measures in the battle against inflation. As a result, the probability of a 25bps rate hike during the May meeting has been revised higher.  Surge in Covid Cases  Investors are also worried over the recent spate in fresh Covid cases. India recorded 9,111 new coronavirus infections, while the active cases increased to 60,313, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Monday. The death toll increased to 5,31,141.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/bleeding-tech-stocks-fed-fears-and-other-factors-behind-1-2-slump-in-markets-10424341.html

The brokerage said Tech Mahindra was downgraded for the following reasons: increased risks to growth in the communications vertical, which accounts for approximately 40 percent of the company’s revenue. Recent data points and commentary have raised concerns, prompting caution from Citi.  There are near-term challenges and a negative catalyst watch is already in place, which may be exacerbated by macroeconomic factors, the brokerage said in its latest report. Operating deleverage may lead to lower margins than what consensus expectations are. Lastly, while there are positives associated with leadership change, they may take some time to materialise.  &quot;In that context, valuations are at 16x 1-yr forward cons EPS – risk-reward looks unfavorable, in our view. We lowered our target multiple to 15x (17x earlier) to factor these risks – new TP of Rs955 (Rs1100 earlier). Our FY24E/FY25E EPS are 7-14 percent below consensus,” Citi said.  It has been a disappointing March quarter for IT firms, so far.  Both Infosys and TCS reported a decline in revenues in the telecom vertical in 4Q, with -8 percent constant currency (CC) quarter on quarter (QoQ) and -2 percent cc QoQ, respectively. Management comments across companies have reflected caution with regard to the telecom sector but the headwinds seem to be stronger than expected.  In its third quarter call, Tech Mahindra had said revenues from top 5 clients had declined due to restructuring in some clients. Though management expected it to stabilise by 4Q, the challenges could persist given macroeconomic uncertainty.  Tech Mahindra is expected to report its March quarter earnings on April 27.  Challenges across multiple verticals such as discretionary cuts and deferrals, vendor consolidation, and pricing pressure could further negatively impact growth, Citi said.  Tech Mahindra has outlined several margin levers, including reducing sub-contracting costs, adjusting the offshoring mix, spinning off or shutting down non-strategic businesses, implementing automation and delivery excellence measures, and leveraging synergies with portfolio companies. The pace of margin improvement in the near term could be slower than expected due to growth challenges and the likelihood of discretionary costs returning, Citi said.

Find out what brokerages feel about the stock after Q4,"Infosys Q4: At constant currency (CC), the company's revenue grew by 8.8 percent on-year during the fourth quarter, and by 15.4 percent during the entire fiscal year.","The Infosys share price plunges nearly 12 percent in the early trade on April 17 after the company came out with its March quarter earnings last week.  It has touched a 52-week low of Rs 1,223 and was quoting at Rs 1,227.60, down Rs 161.00, or 11.59 percent on the BSE.  Infosys on April 13 reported a 7.8 percent on-year rise in its consolidated net profit at Rs 6,128 crore for the quarter ended March 2023.

At constant currency (CC), the company's revenue grew 8.8 percent on-year during the fourth quarter, and by 15.4 percent during the entire fiscal year.  Catch all the market action on our live blog  Here is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company post March quarter earnings:  Nomura  Nomura has downgraded Infosys from a ‘buy’ to a ‘neutral’ rating, and also cut its target price from Rs 1,660 to Rs 1,290 per share.  The weak guidance for FY24 and growth differential with TCS are set to narrow.  Nomura also believes that the guidance and deal wins indicate a weak outlook for the company. Additionally, broking house has cut its FY24-25 EPS estimates for Infosys by 8-9 percent.  Emkay  Emkay has maintained a ‘buy’ rating for Infosys, but has cut its target price from Rs 1,700 to Rs 1,620 per share.  The brokerage house has also cut its EPS estimates for FY24/25 by 4.4-6.3 percent due to disappointing Q4 results. Despite this, Emkay believes that Infosys is well-positioned to capture growth opportunities in the digital transformation space. However, the asking rate at the upper end of guidance appears to be demanding.  Ambit  Ambit has given Infosys a ‘sell’ rating and has cut its target price from Rs 1,505 to Rs 1,340 per share. Growth, margin, and guidance being materially below broking firm expectations. The US verticals have seen declines, but Ambit believes that the FY24 guidance of 4-7 percent growth implies a 1.7-2.9 percent CQGR over Q1-Q4.  The broking house has moderated its CC (constant currency) revenue growth to 5/7.3 percent in FY24/25 from 7.1/7.7 percent. Additionally, Ambit has cut its FY25 EPS estimates by 5 percent.  DAM Capital  DAM Capital has downgraded Infosys to ‘neutral’ and reduced the target price from Rs 1,594 to Rs 1,390 per share. The report has also lowered the earnings per share (EPS) estimates for FY24 and FY25 by 4.7 percent and 6 percent, respectively.  Broking firm expect company to deliver a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.9 percent over FY23-25 and expect to deliver 70 basis points increase in margin over the same period. Additionally, the report values the company at 19 times FY25 EPS, with a discount rate of 20 percent to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).  Motilal Oswal  Motilal Oswal has maintained a ‘buy’ rating on Infosys, while reduces the target price to Rs 1,520 per share. The report expects FY24 EBIT margin at 21.1 percent, which is flat year-on-year. And expect FY24 profit growth in a single-digit at 9.3 percent YoY for FY24. It has lowered the FY24-FY25 earnings per share (EPS) by 4 percent and 5 percent.  JPMorgan  JPMorgan has downgraded Infosys to an ‘underweight’ rating and has cut its target price from 1,500 to 1,200 per share. Broking house feels that uninspiring commentary and ambitious guidance post sharp miss, triggering a reappraisal. As a result, it has cut revenue by 4-5 percent and margin by 70 bps, driving 8-9 percent EPS cuts over FY24/25.  JPMorgan also notes that the FY24 guidance of 4-7 percent CC revenue growth and 20-22 percent margin is below their consensus. The guidance bakes in an ambitious ask rate of 1.6-2.7 percent CQGR, which appears uncharacteristically H2FY24 heavy. The company is prone to subsequent downgrades.  CLSA  CLSA has downgraded Infosys to an ‘outperform’ rating from 'buy' and has cut its target price from RS 1,800 to Rs 1,550 per share. CLSA has cited the weak Q4FY23 and disappointing FY24 guidance. The larger disappointment was the weak margin outlook, as the FY24 EBIT margin guidance of 20-22 percent versus 21-23 percent was expected.  The FY24 EBIT margin guidance has driven a 6 percent/5 percent cut to FY24/FY25 EPS estimates. Additionally, the management commentary was uninspiring, which was an additional dampener.  Citi  Citi has downgraded Infosys to a ‘neutral’ rating and has cut its target price from Rs 1,675 to Rs 1,400 per share. Citi expects weak Q4 and uncertain macro conditions to weigh on multiples, and has revised its FY24/FY25 EPS estimates lower by 4-5 percent while also lowering its target multiple to 22x.  Citi notes that the pace of change in sentiment on discretionary spending has surprised, and this will have medium-term implications for smaller companies. The communication sector appears particularly weak in both TCS and Infosys. Tech Mahindra remains the most exposed.  UBS  UBS has given Infosys a ‘Neutral’ rating and has cut its target price to RS 1,570 per share. UBS believes that Infosys' -3.2 percent QoQ CC revenue growth was significantly lower than expectations. While QoQ decline in operating margin, isn't bad given the sharp decline in revenue and utilisation.  It was a weak performance on all counts, and the guidance for FY24 did not provide any help either, as a result, UBS anticipates a sharp negative reaction for the stock.  BoFA Securities  BoFA Securities has given Infosys a ‘neutral’ rating and has cut its target price to Rs 1,390 per share. The brokerage house cut its FY24/25 EPS estimates by 2 percent/3 percent.  The Q4 was an uncharacteristically large under-shoot. The dip in margin and under-shoot to the FY24 revenue and margin guidance follows from the topline miss in the quarter.  Morgan Stanley  The broking house has been given an 'overweight' rating to the stock and slashed the target price to Rs 1,475 per share from Rs 1,625 per share. The report notes a negative surprise in Q4FY23 results and weak order book, which implies a less conservative revenue outlook that is a key concern.  The report also highlights that the lowering of the lower band of margin outlook for FY24 is a key concern for the company. The report expects a potential correction in the stock in line with the ADR reaction of down 9-10 percent.  However, the report notes that the QoQ growth rate performance is expected to be better for Infosys than TCS in Q1FY24. The report also expects the P/E discount to normalize through the year.  Kotak Institutional Equities  The research firm has given a 'buy' rating for the stock, but the target price has been cut to Rs 1,470 per share from Rs 1,700 per share. The report notes a cut in revenue growth and margin estimates, leading to a 6-7 percent cut to FY24-25 EPS estimates.  The report also mentions that Infosys' QoQ revenue decline due to aggressive cuts to discretionary programs. The general slowdown in tech spends on account of macro pressure and uncertainty and one-time revenue impact of nearly 1 percent from project cancellations.  The report expects muted Q1FY24 performance, but growth recovery in H2FY24, led by large/mega deal revenue.

But as the Infosys numbers show, the market needs to brace for a sharp divergence in financial performance among large caps as well","“Guessing at the future rate of interest is, in my opinion, one of the most puzzling problems in the world.” -  John Maynard Keynes  Bad news in the IT space continues with Infosys’ underwhelming fourth quarter numbers. IT stocks could be in for some rough weather in the near term, but it is not as if the market did not see it coming. Investors were cautious on the sector even as management commentary was broadly positive through FY23. TCS shares fell less than 2 percent on Thursday despite bearish views from most broking firms. But as the Infosys numbers show, the market needs to brace for a sharp divergence in financial performance among large caps as well.  Infosys  The stock could take a beating today after a rash of rating downgrades and steep cuts in price targets by leading brokers. Nomura, JP Morgan, CLSA and Citi have downgraded their ratings, trimmed target price and earnings per share estimates, while UBS has retained its neutral rating. This could most likely result in fund managers preferring TCS over Infosys near term, as the growth differential between the two has narrowed after the latest quarterly performance.    Tata Motors  The company plans to increase prices of its passenger vehicles from May 1, with the weighted average increase around 0.6 percent. The stock has been on a tear since late March, climbing 17 percent. Strong JLR wholesales for the March quarter has been the key sentiment driver. Consolidated earnings for the December saw a significant improvement with the company reporting a net profit after seven successive quarters of losses. Continuation of that performance will be key to the stock breaking past its peak of Rs 510 seen in January 2022. Broker outlook on the stock at this point is largely positive, with JP Morgan being the notable exception. JPM has a neutral rating on the stock as it remains cautious on demand and pricing for FY24 because of inventory levels normalizing. It has also flagged growth moderation in commercial vehicles as well as passenger vehicles.  Zee Entertainment  CNBCTV18 reports that institutional investor Oppenheimer is looking to sell a 5.65 percent stake through an open market deal for between Rs 200-Rs 208 a share. Oppenheimer has been a vocal critic of Zee management’s corporate governance for a while now, and the deal could come as a relief to both parties. It also removes a key overhang for the stock, which has been struggling for the last six months despite repeated assurances from Zee that the merger deal with Sony is well on track.  SBI  India’s number one lender has said that it will keep lending rates unchanged effective April 15. Banks in general have been steadily cranking up lending rates for the last many months. SBI’s latest move could most likely have to do with the RBI pausing on rate hikes. But the central bank had made it clear that the pause was a one-off and further measures will depend on the inflation trajectory. It may still be early for borrowers for rejoice. From the stock market perspective, the shift money-from equity-to-fixed income trade is pretty much alive and kicking.  Good news and bad  The good news first: US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that the US Federal Reserve may not have to raise interest rates by much in the days ahead. The bad news: banks are likely to become more cautious and may tighten lending further in the wake of recent bank failures.  In an interview to CNN, Yellen said that a restriction in credit in the economy could be a substitute for further interest rate hikes that the Fed needs to make.  Dr Copper  Copper prices touched a seven-week high of $9,200 a tonne ($4.12 a pound) on Friday, but bulls of the red metal may need to keep their enthusiasm in check.

In China, BYD is already giving Tesla a run for its money.  “Tesla last year reduced its prices in China twice. BYD increased its prices. BYD is so much ahead of Tesla in China ... it’s almost ridiculous,” renowned value investor Munger recently told CNBC. BYD gave a preliminary estimate of its 2022 net profit as $2.4-2.5 billion, a fivefold jump over the previous, which analysts say is an indication that it is now competing with Tesla in the premium category.  Slow EV adoption  The US is lagging behind much of the developed world in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, reports zerohedge.com citing a survey by the Financial Times.  “Only two in 10 Americans are very likely to buy an EV, even with the additional subsidies offered by the Inflation Reduction Act. Cost and charger availability are being cited as the two main reasons people aren't buying EVs.

This was primarily due to broad-based reduction in business volumes, led by unplanned project ramp downs and delays in new businesses during the early part of Q4. Additionally, the company saw one-off project cancellations and issues with a few clients, primarily on discretionary spending, which it expects to recover in 1QFY24. Further, TCV for large deals in 4Q stood at USD2.1b, down 37% QoQ. As a result of weak 4Q performance, INFO missed its FY23 USD revenue growth guidance of 16.0-16.5% YoY CC, delivering only 15.4% YoY. For FY24, the company has given USD CC revenue growth guidance of 4-7% YoY, citing increased uncertainty for the wider guidance band. This implies a CQGR of 1.5-2.5% between lower and upper end of guidance band, which we consider to be ambitious. Outlook Despite near-term weakness, we expect INFO to be a key beneficiary of acceleration in IT spends in the medium term. Based on our revised estimates, the stock is currently trading at 19x FY25E EPS. We value the stock at 21x FY25E EPS, implying a TP of INR1,520.

infosys,2023-04-14T15:07:24+05:30,Suchitra Mandal,"TCS, Infosys warn of subdued demand amid global uncertainty after disappointing Q4","Deferrals in discretionary spending from clients, with the hefty BFSI vertical being the most affected, presages gloomy days ahead for the poster boys of the Indian tech sector.","While the underwhelming earnings of India’s top two IT services firms have disappointed the street, some more pain may be on the cards as the management of both companies warned of further subdued demand amid macro uncertainties plaguing the US and Europe.  On April 13, Infosys reported a 7.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in its consolidated net profit of Rs 6,128 crore, while revenue increased 16 percent to Rs 37,441 crore. The company saw a quarterly de-growth of 4.4 percent and 2.3 percent in profit and revenue, respectively.   The company's US-listed shares fell 10 percent in New York trading, while it closed 3 percent lower on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) on April 13. Meanwhile, its peer and the country’s largest IT firm, TCS, closed 2 percent down.  TCS also reported lower-than-expected numbers with revenue from operations increasing 16.9 percent YoY at Rs 59,162 crore, and profit growing 14.8 percent to Rs 11,392 crore. Sequentially, growth came in at 1.4 percent and 5 percent for revenue and profit, respectively.   Also Read: Infosys Q4 profit rises 7.8%. How do brokerages see the stock?  “The March quarter has been weaker than anticipated, primarily due to North America,&quot; said TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan, adding, &quot;We were expecting a comeback after a seasonally-weak third quarter, but that didn’t happen.&quot;  While the March quarter was expected to be seasonally weak, with analysts also anticipating and factoring in additional subdued growth due to weakness in the financial services segment resulting from liquidity concerns in the US and Europe due to the collapse of SVB and Credit Suisse, the performance was weaker than anticipated and is especially concerning at a time when talks of recession are also trickling in.  “I think in the near term there are challenges. Analysts have assigned a 30-35 percent probability that the US might be going through a recession, so yes, there is a bit of a risk in the near-term, because of which the TCS management has been a bit cautious in its guidance,” said Sumit Jain of ICICI Securities in an interview to ET.  TCS management has not indicated when it expects growth to pick up and whether it will be front- or back-loaded in FY23-24, said Girish Pai, Head of Research at Nirmal Bang, a broking firm, adding that he suspects that growth will be broadly weak across all quarters and possibly turn weaker in the second half, since he thinks that the adverse impact of a weak macro lies ahead and not behind us.  Meanwhile, Infosys has given a USD CC (constant currency) revenue growth guidance of 4-7 percent YoY, citing increased macro uncertainties.  Also Read: Infosys to roll out structure for financial services team as Mohit Joshi leaves  “The 4Q revenue growth was surprising and is likely to have a dampening effect on the company’s FY23-24 growth, particularly since it suggests a significant impact on growth from Infosys’s discretionary business, which has been facing pressure in the recent few months due to the macroeconomic slowdown. We expect FY23-24 revenue growth to be around 5.2 percent YoY in CC terms, which is near the lower end of the guidance band, as it takes time for mega deals to convert into orders and revenues,” said analysts at Motilal Oswal.  For TCS, they said that management commentary on near-term demand was among the weakest in recent history (excluding the initial months of the pandemic), with the management indicating weakness in the US on account of deferrals in clients’ discretionary spends with the BFSI (banking and financial services) vertical being the most affected.  Foreign brokerage firm Nomura reduced its Buy rating for Infosys to Neutral, while also cutting its target price (TP) to Rs 1,290 from Rs 1,660 earlier. It said that the guidance and deal wins indicate a weak outlook and the growth differential with TCS will narrow.

The declines were seen across all verticals in the US, it said, and moderated the company’s’ constant currency (cc) revenue growth to 5/7.3 percent in FY24/25 from 7.1/7.7 percent, and also cut the FY25 EPS estimates by 5 percent.  Foreign brokerage firm Nomura downgraded Infosys to 'neutral' from 'buy' and cut its TP to Rs 1,290 from Rs 1,660.

They see Infosys' FY24 revenue growth guidance at 4-7 percent, implying 1.5 percent to 3.2 percent CQGR, reflecting a strong pick-up in growth mostly in H2FY24. They are building in weak 1.4 percent QoQ constant currency revenue growth guidance for Q1FY24, followed by a sharp pick-up in the remaining 9MFY24.  “This makes us forecast a 6.4 percent CC revenue growth in FY24, closer to the higher end of the guidance. For FY25/26, we largely maintain our double digit revenue growth forecast of 13 percent/12.4 percent in CC terms as structural demand drivers for the industry around cloud migration/digitalisation and cost optimisation remain intact,” it added.

We have trained open-source generative AI platforms on our internal software development libraries. We anticipate generative AI to provide more opportunities for work with our clients, and to enable us to improve our productivity,” Parekh said.  Generative AI is fast emerging as the new tech battleground as companies go head-to-head to bag a bigger share of the pie. The immense popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT has thrust the new technology into the spotlight.  Going big on generative AI  Parekh added that the Bengaluru-headquartered firm was working with both open-source and proprietary platforms and had trained open-source generative AI platforms on its internal software development libraries as well.  “We have active client projects today, the projects that we're working on focused on large models within the client organisation for different areas and how generative AI can take advantage of those large models, and create something that is more efficient for the client,&quot; he said.  The company was working on its own software development tool on an open-source generative AI platform— &quot;we are actually working with two of them. We are building. We are training in our software development libraries”, Parekh said.  Generative AI would provide more opportunities for work with its clients and also enable the company to improve productivity, he added.  Infosys posted a disappointing set of numbers, with its Q4FY23 dollar revenue down 2.2 percent sequentially at $4,554 million. For the year, revenue growth in constant currency came in at 15.4 percent, below the company’s guidance of 16-16.5 percent. The company's net profit declined 7 percent to Rs 6,128 crore sequentially.  For the next year, it has guided for revenue growth of 4-7 percent.  Infy's ChatGPT connection  Infosys was one of the first backers of OpenAI under former CEO Vishal Sikka. In 2015, Parekh said Infosys supported OpenAI with a donation.  Read: India has a unique opportunity and responsibility in AI: Vishal Sikka  Last quarter, Parekh said that there were examples where the company was using ChatGPT with client situations which in turn was starting to further increase productivity and automation.  Infosys’ rival TCS, which reported its results on April 12, also said generative AI was dominating conversations with clients. Chief Operating Officer NG Subramaniam said that in interactions with clients over the last quarter, the “conversation starts and stops with ChatGPT”. TCS is also running pilots and plans to have a centre of excellence around the technology.  Accenture CEO Julie Sweet has said the company has been integrating generative AI.  “When people talk about the new kinds of generative AI, which we're super excited about being like a copilot to human beings, the entire process has to be changed in order to make that work. You've got to upskill the people and you have to be able to do all of that in a very responsible way.  So we're already working with it. There's been a lot of demand to understand this,” she said. While understanding how hard it would be able to implement at scale in an enterprise, too, was a great opportunity, she said.  Generative artificial intelligence learns from past data.

The IT major lost its presidents, considered potential CEO candidates for the company after Salil Parekh’s tenure, in a short span of six months. They moved to competitors in CEO roles — Kumar as the CEO of Cognizant and Joshi as the incoming CEO of Tech Mahindra.  Infosys Chief Executive Officer Parekh said that they have put in place a structure for the delivery organisation, pertaining to Kumar’s role. The functions of Kumar, who exited the company last October, were primarily split between Sathish HC and Dinesh Rao.  Joshi headed financial services and healthcare, the software businesses, sales operations and transformation and executive responsibility for large deals.

So we feel good with the leadership pool that we have within the company who are moving up to take a broader role and a larger role that they will step up and deliver what we are driving to,” Parekh told analysts.  Joshi’s tenure will officially end in June, but he has been on leave since March. He will take over as the CEO of Tech Mahindra on December 20 after the retirement of current CEO CP Gurnani.

infosys,2023-04-14T07:15:25+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Morning Scan: All the big stories to get you started for the day,A round-up of top newspaper stories to keep you ahead of others.,"1. Infosys sees weak revenue growth of 4-7 per cent in 2023-24, slowest in six years  Infosys has forecast its slowest revenue growth in six years of 4-7 per cent for 2023-24 as India’s second-largest software exporter flagged ramp-downs of client mandates amid an uncertain macro environment in its major markets of US and Europe. Revenue expanded by 15.4 per cent in the just-concluded financial year, was below its own guidance range. For the March quarter, it posted a 7.8 per cent on-year increase in consolidated net profit to Rs 6,128 crore, below street expectations. Sequentially, net profit fell 7 per cent.  Why it’s important: India’s software companies are seeing subdued demand as clients in key western market become cautious on fears of an economic slowdown and high interest rates. TCS has also reported weaker-than-anticipated quarterly earnings.  2. India’s goods exports shrink the most in three years in March, trade deficit widens  Merchandise exports in March slipped to $38.38 billion compared to $44.57 billion in the previous year, registering a 13 per cent fall. At the same time, goods imports rose over 16 per cent to touch $714 billion, widening the goods trade deficit to a fresh record of $267 billion against the previous year’s $191 billion. Overall trade deficit touched a record $122 billion in 2022-23, as exports of $770 billion were outmatched by faster imports to a record $892 billion.  Why it’s important: Goods exports are expected to be under pressure in the financial year to March 2024 as economic activity sputters and demand cools across the globe. The trade deficit may widen further.  3. Liquidity surplus at nine-month high on government spending, fund inflows  Liquidity surplus in the Indian banking system, measured by funds that lenders park with the central bank, climbed to its highest level in nine months on accelerated government expenditure and overseas inflows into local financial assets. The weighted average call rate, an operating target for the rate-setting panel at Reserve Bank, declined 0.13 percentage point below the current repo rate of 6.5 per cent. Foreign portfolio investors have bought $1.1 billion of Indian equities so far in April. The rupee has risen 1 per cent in 2023.  Why it’s important: The surplus liquidity driven mainly by huge government spending is driving down money market rates. Liquidity conditions might tighten in coming months in line with the Reserve Bank’s stance of withdrawing monetary accommodation.  4. Comcast to invest $200 million in Bodhi Tree, which in turn will invest in Viacom18  Comcast Corp has entered the Indian media and entertainment industry with an initial investment of Rs 1,600 crore ($200 million) in Bodhi Tree Systems, an investment vehicle led by Uday Shankar and James Murdoch. Comcast-run NBC Universal received approval from the Competition Commission to invest in Bodhi Tree, which will pave the way for the US MNC a small indirect stake in Viacom18 Media.  Why it’s important: Bodhi Tree will invest the fresh funds in Viacom18 Media controlled by Reliance Industries. It will separately invest Rs 4,306 crore Viacom18 as the first part of an overall commitment of Rs 13,500 crore. Group entities of Reliance Industries will put in an additional Rs 10,839 crore.  5. FirstCry in talks with sovereign funds to sell stake at valuation of almost $3 billion  Omnichannel retailer FirstCry is in discussions with sovereign funds to help some shareholders to sell a stake at a valuation of nearly $3 billion. This follows after deal talks with private equity firm Kedaara Capital fell through a few months ago. The funding is being primed as a pre-IPO round for the Pune-based startup. SoftBank, the largest shareholder, may sell a part of its 29 per cent holding. Around $100 million worth of secondary share sale is likely to be formalized.  Why it’s important: The retailer of mother and baby products may also look to infuse additional domestic capital as it must keep foreign holding to under 51 per cent, being a multi-brand retailer.  6. Air India looking at ways to refinance Rs 18,000 crore short-term loans  Tata Group-owned Air India is seeking to refinance short-term loans with local banks with longer tenure facilities as the carrier finalises future borrowing needs based on expected cash flows. The longer-tenure loans will replace the short-term loans of Rs 18,000 crore the Tata Group had taken from State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda in 2022 and renewed in 2023. Top public and private sector banks will be competing for a part of the deal likely to be finalized next month.  Why it’s important: Air India, which was privatized last year in January, has plans for large investments to overhaul the company and expand its market share in the country’s rapidly expanding aviation sector.  7. Inflows in equity mutual funds at 12-month high at Rs 20,500 crore in March  Net investments in active equity schemes rose to a 12-month high of Rs 20,500 crore in March. The tally was underpinned by investments through systematic investment plans, which breached Rs 14,000 crore for the first time, data released by the Association of Mutual Funds in India show. In 2021-22, mutual funds added over 4 million new investors, taking the total unique investor count to 37.7 million.  Why it’s important: Investors have stepped up buying as valuations have turned attractive, with the benchmark Sensex and Nifty dropping to their lowest levels in five months. Mutual funds are becoming the preferred savings vehicle for the middle class.  8. Apple’s India push gets $7 billion output boost for iPhones  Apple assembled more than $7 billion of iPhones in India in the year to March, tripling production in the world’s fastest-growing smartphone market after accelerating a move beyond China. The US company now makes almost 7 per cent of its iPhones in India through expanding partners from Foxconn Technology Group to Pegatron Corporation. That’s a significant leap for India, which accounted for an estimated 1 per cent of the world’s iPhones in 2021.  Why it’s important: Apple is exploring ways to reduce its reliance on China as tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to escalate. China’s loss has been India’s gain.  9. Finance ministry asks state-run banks to achieve financial inclusion targets  The finance ministry has asked the public sector banks to achieve the targets allocated to them under the various government schemes for financial inclusion and social security in a time-bound manner. The department of financial services in a meeting reviewed progress under various social security schemes, including Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana, Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, Stand Up India, and PM SVANidhi. The three-month long saturation campaign of PMJJBY and PMSBY schemes launched on April 1 were also discussed.  Why it’s important: the central government will seek to maximize spending on various welfare programs ahead of the parliamentary elections in 2024. Higher financial inclusion could pay electoral dividends.  10. New tussle starts over 6GHz band that deliver speeds comparable with 5G  After fighting over spectrum for captive private networks, telecom firms and tech companies are now locked in a fresh tussle over 6 GHz airwaves that offer 5G- like broadband speeds. Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio Infocomm and Vodafone Idea want the 6 GHz band to be auctioned, saying it is useful for commercial deployment of 5G services as well as for 5.5G and 6G in the future. Technology firms, represented by the Broadband India Forum (BIF), want the same band allotted without auctions for WIFI services, which are typically offered on unlicensed spectrum.  Why it’s important: As boundaries blur between telos and tech firms, expect such conflicts to rise in coming days. 6 GHz band is a mid-band spectrum that has been opened up for unlicensed use in many countries. The Indian government’s stance on it is yet unclear.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/morning-scan-all-the-big-stories-to-get-you-started-for-the-day-448-10411431.html
infosys,2023-04-13T19:43:28+05:30,Haripriya Suresh,Infosys logs in disappointing set of numbers for Q4,"Infosys also saw a one-time impact on revenue, according to the company's leadership. ","Infosys posted a disappointing set of numbers for the quarter, with the impact of the current stress on IT and challenging macroeconomic climate coming through in the company’s numbers -- missing not just estimates but also its own guidance on revenue growth for the year.  While the IT major had affirmed a revenue growth guidance in constant currency at 16-16.5 percent at the end of last quarter, it posted a full-year revenue growth of 15.4 percent. Sequentially, revenue for the quarter declined 2.2 percent in reported terms, and fell 3.2 percent in constant currency terms, coming in at $4,554 million.  Infosys also had a one-time impact on revenue, according to the leadership. “During the quarter we saw unplanned project rampdowns in some of our clients and delays in decision making which resulted in lower volumes. In addition, we had some one-time revenue impact,” Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh said.  ALSO READ: Infosys’ headcount declines by 3,611 employees in Q4  This one-time impact on revenue, Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy said, was due to volume, but was also “a combination of cancellations and specific client issues”.  The company’s EBIT margins came in at 21 percent for the year, at the lower end of its guidance for the year of 21-22 percent. For the quarter too, it contracted from last quarter’s 21.5 percent.  The company’s guidance going forward too, for FY24, has been below what was estimated. It has guided for 4-7 percent revenue growth for the year, and operating margin guidance came in at 20-22 percent.  The last time the company's revenue was in this guided range was in FY18, when it posted a revenue growth of 5.8 percent.  Parekh said that the company had some unplanned project rampdowns in some clients, as well as delays in decision making which resulted in lower volumes.  “Some of the clients that decided to slow down or stop some of the projects. These were things we had not seen at the start or end of last quarter. And that's what we felt. We've also seen some of that stabilizing in March, but the demand environment is uncertain. We are making sure that we keep that in mind as we look ahead and remain agile as we look ahead,” Parekh told the press.  He told Moneycontrol that while there is a large deal pipeline, there is slowing down in the cycle of closing deals.  Asked on the numbers posted by the company, Parekh said, “In some places, we saw a one time impact with clients. Those were things we saw during the quarter. The demand or market environment changed and that is what caused us to have the outcome that we had in Q4.”  In verticals, Parekh called out softness in parts of hi-tech, retail, telecom as well as parts of financial services such as asset management, investment banking and mortgage.  Last quarter too, he had called softness in mortgage and investment banking along with telco, hi-tech and retail.  The fourth quarter is a seasonally weak quarter for Infosys.  The company’s large deal total contract value (TCV) stood at $3.3 billion in Q3, and declined to $2.1 in the fourth quarter. In the same time period last year, it had a TCV of $2.3 billion.  The company’s large deal TCV in FY22 stood at $9.5 billion for the full year, and increased marginally to $9.8 billion in FY23.  The banking crisis was expected to weigh on the results of IT companies. The first three months of the year was marked by the global banking contagion due to the collapse of various regional banks based in the United States such as the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank, and Credit Suisse. This added to the IT industry's existing struggles with macro-economic challenges. In fact, a JP Morgan report had stated that TCS and Infosys have the highest SVB and US regional banking exposure.  TCS took a pessimistic tone when it announced results on April 12, with the quarter coming in weaker than expected, and that the company saw volatility in the banking system.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/infosys-posts-disappointing-set-of-numbers-in-q4fy23-sees-deferrals-and-rampdowns-10410361.html

The company’s headcount growth for the year was 29,219 employees, down 46 percent from last year’s net addition of 54,396.  With this, Infosys' headcount stands at 3,43,234 as of March 31, 2023. This is the first time since the Covid-hit quarter of FY21 that Infosys is ending a quarter with fewer employees than it had at the end of the previous quarter. In the same quarter last year, Infosys added 21,948 employees.  For each quarter in the fiscal, Infosys has significantly reduced its net addition, a trend it has continued with the fourth quarter as well, a sign of the increasing stress on the IT sector. The company added 21,171 employees on a net basis in Q1, 10,032 in Q2, and 1,627 in Q3, before going into the red in Q4.  The company, which announced its results for Q4FY23, saw its revenue growth in constant currency for the year growing at 15.4 percent, below its guidance of 16-16.5 percent.  Read: TCS slashes hiring to 22,600 in FY23 from 1.03 lakh a year back  Attrition for the quarter fell to 20.9 percent, continuing its downward trend from last quarter’s 24.3 percent on a trailing-twelve-month basis. As the talent market cools off, attrition rates have continued to normalise further.  After attrition reached 28.4 percent in Q1FY23, it slipped to 27.1 percent in Q2FY23 and 24.3 percent in Q3. The company’s leadership has previously said that quarterly annualised attrition has continued to trend downwards, and it was expected to reduce in the near term.  The company hired roughly 51,000 freshers in FY23, taking it a little above its target of 50,000 freshers for the year. However, the company refused to share any numbers or its hiring plans for FY24.  This also comes at a time when the company's utilisation has fallen.  &quot;Utilisation declined to 80 percent on the back of softness of demand. We expect the utilisation to improve gradually in the coming quarters. As freshers start getting deployed, we will calibrate the hiring for FY24 based on the available pool of employees, growth expectations and attrition trends,&quot; Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy told analysts.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/infosys-headcount-declines-by-3611-employees-in-q4-10409001.html

Indian IT companies that rely heavily on revenue from the BFSI sector, particularly from the US and Europe, are facing significant setbacks due to the banking crisis resulting from the collapse of SVB and the subsequent takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS.  As clients in these markets face liquidity concerns, IT firms are expected to see decreased technology spending budgets and delayed decision-making, leading to project deferrals.  While TCS recorded an order book value of $10 billion this quarter, Morgan Stanley, with an 'equal-weight' rating and a target price of Rs 3,350, says clarity is limited on whether sentiment has troughed despite the strong order book.

Infosys’s consolidated revenue is expected to come in at Rs 38,859 crore, marking 20.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth, according to an analysts’ poll.

Infosys, specifically, has a 26 percent exposure to the banking and financial services sector, excluding insurance, Kotak Institutional Equities says.  “Expect muted CC revenue growth of 0.6 percent QoQ due to seasonality and weakness in Financial Services; USD growth implies 110BP of currency tailwind.

According to the analyst poll, Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) are expected to come in at Rs 8,395 crore, with the margin projected to expand by 78 bps to 21.6 percent.  Analysts differ on the extent of margin expansion. IDBI Capital expects the EBIT margin to expand by 83 bps QoQ to 22.3 percent, helped by reduced attrition.

infosys,2023-04-12T10:05:54+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Narayana Murthy's pro-tip to entrepreneurs on when to give up on an idea,"Narayana Murthy, in a chat with Snaldeal co-founder Kunal Bahl, shared a key lesson he learnt as an entrepreneur.","NR Narayana Murthy recently gave a valuable piece of advice to entrepreneurs, stressing on the fact that it is important to recognise symptoms of failure early on and not be too attached to an idea. In a chat with Snapdeal co-founder Kunal Bahl, the Infosys co-founder said if an entrepreneur finds a “structural weakness” in their idea, it’s time to give up on that idea.  Murthy was asked how an entrepreneur can decide when to give up and when to continue to fight. He went down memory lane and recalled the time in 1976 when he founded a company named Softronics. Murthy shared the reasons of his failure in Softronics and why he closed it in nine months.  “I realised that there was really no market for services in India at that time because there were very few computers and most of the computers were in the government or some of the institutions,” he told Kunal Bahl, who is also the co-founder of Titan Capital.    “What are the reasons why an entrepreneur should close down? If you find that there is a structural weakness in your idea as far as the market is concerned, that is the time to give up,” the iconic tech leader said.  A structural weakness, according to Narayana Murthy, is one over which a person has no way of finding a solution.  “It is something over which no matter what sacrifice you do, no matter how hard you work, no matter what team you have, you will not be able to overcome it.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/narayana-murthys-advice-to-entrepreneurs-on-when-to-give-up-on-an-idea-10399101.html

infosys,2023-04-07T18:45:28+05:30,Debangana Ghosh,"IT may log in muted revenue in Q4, analysts see bleak near-term outlook for BFSI","Top-level exits and appointments, the banking crisis in the US and Europe, a worsening macroeconomic climate, and uncertainty about budgets for the new fiscal, all have contributed to this state of affairs.","The January-March quarter was a period of intense action in India’s IT companies — several top-level exits and appointments, the banking crisis in the US and Europe, a worsening macroeconomic climate and uncertainty about budgets for the new fiscal — all plagued companies. Now, as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) kicks off the earnings season next week, here’s a primer on what will be watched for in the IT sector.  The Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) sector will be a key talking point this quarter following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank of the US, followed by Switzerland’s Credit Suisse. Though the Indian IT sector has limited exposure to these banks, the overall global sentiments and pressures on the sector will have an impact on the demand outlook.  Here are a few key factors to watch out for during the upcoming Q4 earning season:  Leadership changes  TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Tech Mahindra and Wipro, all reported top-level appointments and exits this quarter. The biggest shocker was the sudden resignation of TCS CEO and MD Rajesh Gopinathan. K Krithivasan, who was the global head for BFSI, contributing around 38 percent of TCS revenue, was appointed the new CEO.  Amidst the banking crisis, Infosys lost former president Mohit Joshi to Tech Mahindra, where he will be joining as the CEO and MD from December. Joshi was responsible for financial services and insurance segments, among other areas, and led many large deals for the company. This was the second major exit for Infosys in H2FY23, following the exit of president Ravi Kumar S who became the CEO of Cognizant.  “We await to see what happens to the positions vacated by Ravi Kumar (who has become Cognizant CEO) and Mohit Joshi (CEO designate of Tech Mahindra). Would wait to see if the responsibilities are filled internally,” Girish Pai, Head of Research, Nirmal Bang, said in his note.  Similarly, HCL Tech’s Corporate Vice President Sukamal Banerjee who led the $1-billion revenue vertical Engineering and R&amp;amp;D Services (ERS), besides global strategy and investments around emerging technology transformations, too resigned. Rajan Kohli, President of Wipro's Integrated Digital, Engineering and Applications Services Business lines quit as well.  How the commentary around these exits and appointments would shape up and any changes in the business strategies related to these appointments would be important to note.  Impact of banking crisis  “IT companies have mentioned increased cautiousness among clients around decision-making due to heightened uncertainty arising from the recent banking crisis. Deal pipelines have not shrunk, but conversion to new deal wins is taking longer time,” analysts at ICICI Securities said in a note.  Analysts expect near-term demand visibility to be weak, given the macro uncertainties and banking crisis. Among Tier-I IT companies, TCS has the highest exposure to the sector and will be closely watched for its commentary.  Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said, “The banking crisis in US regional banks and European banks can induce greater caution and impact overall tech spends by banking clients.”  The collateral damages to the economies due to the banking crisis and the impact on customer health are yet to be seen, Nirmal Bang said in a note.  Hiring trends  Hiring across companies is expected to be muted, as all of the top five companies have continued to slow down on hiring significantly in each quarter of the year. While Q4 hiring is usually in anticipation of the demand in the new financial year, there were no green shoots this quarter.  In fact, pressure on an already subdued quarter was only exacerbated by the banking crisis, with experts now stating that companies will focus on increasing their utilisation and only backfilling attrition in critical roles. Companies have maintained that the slowdown in hiring is not a factor of demand, but the increased hiring they did in the preceding year. However, another metric to watch out for will be the number of freshers that companies aim to hire in FY24.  Analysts at Emkay Global expect moderation in hiring, with a focus on improving utilisation, deploying freshers post-training and demand moderation. “Better talent availability with significant fresher intake over the past few quarters and lower backfilling costs with reduced churn rate should aid in margin recovery,” the note read.  Onboarding of freshers hired in the previous year has still not been completed in some companies, and companies did go to top colleges they recruit from in the first round of placements. However, the second rung of colleges saw subdued demand from IT companies, which are some of the largest hirers of fresh talent.  “The full impact of the extraordinary hiring of fiscal 2022 was felt in fiscal 2023, because of which employee cost is estimated to rise by over 20 percent. Companies are now focussing on utilisation than advance hiring, supported by lower attrition. This should lead to marginal improvement in operating profitability in fiscal 2024,” said Aditya Jhaver, Director at CRISIL Ratings.  Revenue and PAT estimates  According to Crisil Ratings’ Anuj Sethi, headwinds in the BFSI segment of key markets, such as the US and Europe, will affect revenue growth this quarter.  “While BFSI segment revenue growth is expected to halve to mid-single digit, it would be marginally offset by 12-14 percent growth in the manufacturing segment and 9-11 percent growth in other segments. Net-net, there would be moderation in overall revenue growth,” he said.  Nirmal Bang too, expects revenue growth to be modest, attributing it to decent Total Contract Value (TCV) that companies clocked in the previous quarters.  Motilal Oswal expects most tier-1 companies’ revenues to grow, barring Tech Mahindra at negative 0.7 percent. It expects LTIMindtree to clock revenue growth of 1.6 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in constant currency terms, followed by TCS at 0.9 percent, Infosys and HCLTech at 0.6 percent, and Wipro at 0.5 percent.  Kotak has forecast a modest revenue growth guidance for FY24, which it says “may not be considered conservative due to elevated risks to growth and likely back-ended growth trajectory”.  On profitability for the quarter, Motilal Oswal expects profit after tax (PAT) to grow at 2.9 percent sequentially and 11.1 percent year-on-year (YoY) for tier-1 players. For tier-2, the note estimates a sequential PAT growth of 5.3 percent and 13 percent from the same period last year.  For fiscal 2023, Crisil expects operating profitability to moderate 150-175 basis points (bps) to a decadal low of 22-22.5 percent, due to higher employee costs. “Crisil Ratings expects these costs to moderate next fiscal, with companies taking a cautious approach to fresh hiring as they attempt to normalise headcount after the hiring peaks of fiscal 2022, which saw the employee count for Tier-I firms surge 22 percent,” it said.  For FY24, Crisil expects the sector to see a decline of 700-900 bps in revenue growth.  Demand outlook and tech trends  Impacted customer sectors will look to optimise existing cloud consumption spends. Vendor consolidation deals will also continue to increase.  Apart from the BFSI sector, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said, “the demand outlook of segments such as mortgages, hi-tech, and certain segments of retail and telecom is weak,” as enterprises in impacted segments will prioritise cost efficiencies.  Nirmal Bang’s Pai expects delays in decision-making, focus on cost optmisation and vendor consolidation to be the common themes across company commentaries for 4QFY23. “Seasonally, we think the October-March timeframe tends to be the peak in terms of order inflow for most companies and we expect that to repeat,” he said.  “The management (of IT firms) indicated that the secular demand is still intact in certain verticals and service lines, but suggested near-term caution among clients and some delays in decision-making, which might lead to project deferrals and pause in execution,” said a note from Motilal Oswal.  Moreover, for the customer sectors still open to discretionary tech spending, finding use cases around new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and 5G, will take centre-stage.

Rohan Murty, founder of Soroco, also shared two photos of his parents receiving the Padma Bhushan – his father NR Narayana Murthy in 2008 and his mother now.  He also attended the ceremony and wrote that he and his sister UK First Lady Akshata Murty were “very lucky to have been born into a set of circumstances to learn from these two people”.  He even shared a piece of advice from his father Narayana Murty that he got after he received the Padma Bhushan in 2008.  “I asked him then what is the lesson he would like me and others to learn from his life. He said, &quot;with a lot of luck, perhaps, the circumstances of one's birth need not determine their fate&quot;. He reminded me that luck defines nearly everything but we still have agency over the choices we make. That lesson has stayed with me. Both my parents have lived lives that that have reinforced these ideas,” Rohan Murty wrote.  He also wrote in brief about his mother’s contribution and how she was always immersed in social work.  “In the early 90s my mother taught computer science in a small women's college in Bangalore. While she loved this life, she often felt she could have done even more. She often felt she was as capable, if not more, than my father or any of his colleagues at his work. But as I grew up, I watched her turn this desire into a more positive force. She re-grouped and eventually founded and ran Infosys Foundation for 25 years. Inevitably, when I was in high school, my mother was almost never home. She was constantly in the middle of relief work for floods, earthquakes, working with tribal communities in remote jungles, among other activities. I saw, first hand, how this work impacted lives, gave her meaning and purpose, and a tremendous satisfaction that this was the purpose of her birth -- to help those she can,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post.  He continued: “Along the way she rediscovered her passion for writing and also turned out to be a pretty successful writer. Her example, for me, has been one of purpose, to be able to re-define oneself with good intent, passion, extreme hard work, and a lot of humility.”    &amp;nbsp;  Sudha Murty, 72, Murty dedicated the Padma Bhushan to the people of India. “I hope my recognition today inspires the younger generation to take up social welfare as a vocation.

infosys,2023-04-04T16:36:48+05:30,Suchitra Mandal,Q4FY23 preview: Indian IT services to see muted revenue growth due to global banking turmoil,"Analysts expect IT services companies with high exposure to BFSI to be closely watched for the impact of the banking crisis on their revenues, going forward. While weak macro could impact growth, margins could improve on easing supply pressure, cooling off attrition, and improvements in utilisation.","The recent banking crisis in the United States is expected to have an impact on the earnings of Indian information technology (IT) services companies in Q4FY23, with analysts pointing to weak sequential revenue growth. Despite prompt intervention by central banks, which appears to have contained the banking crisis for now, the risk of further disruption remains.  The banking crisis in the US played out from the beginning of March this year, when Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a lender to tech companies, especially start-ups, faced a run on its deposits and ultimately went under. Another US bank, Signature Bank, followed. A third bank, First Republic Bank, was given support. The biggest casualty was Switzerland’s Credit Suisse, which was taken over by UBS through a government-backed action.  Given Indian IT companies' heavy dependence on Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector for their revenue, IT related spending cuts and extended decision-making cycles implemented by clients in this segment are likely to impact the companies' top line.  Weak revenue growth  According to analysts at JM Financial, the immediate impact on IT services seems to be more on the elongated decision cycles than actual spending cuts. &quot;Recent ructions in the global banking space mean new project starts and the usual year-end flurry of deal closures might have been pushed out,&quot; they note. It believes that firms may land in the lower half of their guided Q4 band and assume their large-cap coverage universe (top-6) to report negative 0.6 percent to 1.2 percent constant currency (CC) quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) revenue growth.  ICICI Securities also warns that while deal pipelines have not shrunk, conversion to new deal wins is taking longer. In some cases, the conversion of order book to revenues in terms of deal ramp-ups is also taking longer than usual.  Also Read:Bullish reversal on the cards, bet on these 3 stocks for up to 19% return in short term  “This, in our view, implies right shifting/postponement of demand to H2FY24E or even FY25E as the digitalisation agenda of clients remains largely intact, but their near-term focus has shifted to cost optimisation and increasing efficiency,” it said, and expects revenue growth in the range of negative 1.9 percent (HCLT) to 0.5 percent (LTIM) in CC terms.  Higher BFSI exposure companies such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro, LTIMindtree, Coforge and Mphasis will need to be closely monitored to understand the impact of the banking crisis on their revenues, going forward, according to Asian Market Securities (Amsec). The adverse impact of IT-related spending cuts should primarily be on discretionary spends, it says, and believes that cost optimisation and vendor consolidation-related spends should remain the prime focus over the next three to four quarters. It projects large companies to report revenue growth in the narrow range of negative 1.6 percent to 1.1 percent QoQ in CC terms, and mid-tier companies to have a wider growth band in the range of negative 5 percent to 5 percent QoQ in CC.  Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal predicts its IT services coverage universe to deliver a median revenue growth of 0.8 percent QoQ and 9.2 percent YoY in CC terms in Q4FY23. Apart from BFSI, Hi-Tech, Manufacturing and Retail may also report muted growth in Q4, it added.  Margin relief  While a weak macro is expected to impact Q4FY23 revenue growth, margins can see some improvement on the back of easing supply pressure, cooling off attrition, and improvements in utilisation, according to the brokerage.  “Tier-I companies should post flat margins, with HCLT (down 150 bpd QoQ on P&amp;amp;P (products and platforms) seasonality) and LTIM (up 180 bps QoQ due to recovery from Q3 low base) being the exceptions. The Tier-II pack will post a wider range of flat to 200 bps QoQ, led by Coforge/Zent with margin improvement of 200 bps/120 bps QoQ,” it said.  JM Financial sees slower growth and falling attrition to limit the efficacy of traditional margin levers and projects a muted margin performance ((80)-20 bps QoQ) for the top 5 players.  “TCS is likely to miss its FY23 exit margin target of 25% while TechM’s margin recovery will likely get pushed out further. LTIMindtree’s Q4 margins, +150 bps, will benefit from lack of one-off merger-related cost, but will still be significantly below normalised levels. Coforge should report the highest margin expansion in our coverage universe (+170 bps; adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)) as it pulls up operating levers to achieve its FY23 margin guidance,” it said.  Amsec, on the other hand, expects margins to benefit from easing of supply side pressure and improved utilisation rates. They believe that the difference between margins of mid-tier and large-tier companies will now blur as favourable supply side dynamics will have an almost equal positive flow-through across companies.  Also Read: Interview | Focus on stocks in sectors that outperforming major indices &amp;amp; showing strong trend, says Prashant Shah of Definedge  Tier-1 vs Tier-2  Cost take-out and vendor consolidation deals are witnessing increase where we believe Tier-1 companies are better positioned to gain market share versus Tier-II companies, it added. The stock broking firm prefers Infosys, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra in large-cap players.  “We expect Infosys to continue to deliver top robust revenue growth, amid strong deal wins and market share gains, the difference in growth vs TCS narrowing though. At the current valuations of 16xFY25E, we believe HCL Tech is attractively priced. TechM is also trading at attractive valuations of 13.6xFY25E EPS, with expectations of upside risks to FY25E numbers with the new CEO bringing in some positive changes.” In Tier-2, it prefers Cyient, Firstsource and Birlasoft due to their high earnings growth trajectory and comfort on valuations.  Motilal Oswal also prefers Tier-I players over Tier-II counterparts, given the former’s attractive valuations, increased traction in vendor consolidation and diversified client portfolios.  Among Tier-I players, it prefers HCL Tech, and Infosys along with TCS. “TCS remains best positioned to benefit from long-term structural tailwinds in tech services and should see a relative pick-up in growth, aided by clients’ focus on cost optimisation and efficiencies. HCLT is one of the key beneficiaries of Cloud adoption at scale, given its expertise in IMS. We expect Infosys to deliver a strong growth, backed by strong deal wins.” In Tier-2, the brokerage leans towards Cyient and Zensar Technologies.  Brokerage firm ICICI Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on TCS, Infosys and LTIM in large-cap, and Mphasis amongst mid-cap players.
