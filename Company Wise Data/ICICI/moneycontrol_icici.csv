During the vote, the shareholders were to decide on the delisting of ICICI Securities and its merger with its parent company, ICICI Bank. Over 500 shareholders of ICICI Securities had collaborated through WhatsApp and social media to file numerous complaints with SEBI.  &quot;The regulator is presently reviewing several complaints. Once substantiated evidence is gathered, SEBI will commence an investigation. The specific actions SEBI may take remain uncertain,&quot; the Mint report quoted an unidentified source.  Earlier, Manu Rishi Guptha, a Bengaluru-based fund manager and a minority shareholder in ICICI Securities, said in an exclusive interaction with Moneycontrol that prior to the board meeting, both ICICI Securities and ICICI Bank had been reaching out to retail shareholders of the former, persuading them to vote in favor of the merger scheme.  Gupta added that the actions have also led to minority shareholder data being compromised as the calls were made by ICICI Bank and not by ICICI Securities, which means that the details were shared with them.  In the Mint report, Guptha also stated that minority investors of ICICI Securities have filed 60-70 complaints with the SEBI and also complained on the SCORES platform. SCORES is SEBI's online platform for filing grievances.  Also Read | MC Exclusive: Minority shareholders file class action suit against ICICI Securities on delisting concerns  He further stated that the primary accusations in these grievances involve the breach of data privacy concerning ICICI Securities' shareholders and the valuation at which the company is slated for delisting.  Guptha is leading team of over 100 ICICI Securities shareholders who, last month, submitted a class action lawsuit to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) challenging ICICI Bank Ltd's bid to delist ICICI Securities.  In a response to the stock exchanges, ICICI Bank clarified that the &quot;outreach program aimed to encourage higher participation in voting&quot; rather than influence decision-making. However, Quantum MF labeled this clarification as a &quot;smokescreen&quot; and an effort to conceal the &quot;malicious&quot; intentions of ICICI Securities.  &quot;Upon initial examination of the clarification response, no valid justification is provided for the queries raised by the stock exchanges. The notice summoning the shareholder's meeting had already been dispatched in February 2024, thus rendering contacting shareholders individually unnecessary,&quot; the mutual fund emphasised.  On March 27, minority shareholders voted in favor of delisting ICICI Securities to wholly merge the entity with its parent, ICICI Bank. Currently, the bank holds a 74.73 percent stake in the brokerage firm, with public shareholders owning the remaining shares.  However, several retail shareholders, collectively owning approximately 6 percent of the company, voiced objections regarding the valuation at which the delisting was proposed. According to the plan, shareholders of ICICI Securities were to receive 67 shares of ICICI Bank for every 100 shares they held in the brokerage firm.  Both ICICI Bank and ICICI Securities have asserted that the valuation was determined by independent appraisers and scrutinised by independent professionals representing both entities.  ICICI Securities notably became the first company to make use of a new SEBI regulation that provides an exemption from the reverse book-building process for price discovery during the delisting of a listed subsidiary involved in a similar business as its parent company.

icici,2024-05-02T17:03:51+05:30,Lovisha Darad,Why Sandeep Bakhshi's exit from ICICI Bank may knock-off the Street,ICICI Bank's four-fold jump in stock price since 2018 reflects investors' faith in the private lender ever since Sandeep Bakhshi donned the heavy hat from Chandra Kochhar,"ICICI Bank’s prompt denial of Managing Director Sandeep Bakhshi “sending feelers” about his desire to exit as reported by The Morning Context managed to arrest any significant erosion in the stock in today’s trade. The ICICI bank stock ended 1 percent lower at Rs 1,139 per share on May 2.  But analysts said it’s not difficult to see why any such news would send a big shock to markets and prove to be sentimentally-negative for ICICI Bank.  From Rs 355 per share in October 2018 to smooth sailing at Rs 1,152 currently, ICICI Bank's four-fold jump in stock price reflects investors' faith in the private lender ever since Sandeep Bakhshi donned the heavy hat from Chandra Kochhar. It’s under his leadership that the bank outpaced SBI, the largest bank in the country by size, in terms m-cap.  ALSO READ: ICICI Bank denies CEO and MD Sandeep Bakhshi wanting to quit, calls report 'baseless'  The big transition  Sandeep Bakhshi's step-up in ICICI Bank came at a time when the lender was not in the best of its shape on October 15, 2018. Prior to his appointment as MD and CEO of ICICI Bank, he was a whole-time director and chief operating officer of the bank. The change of baton took place when predecessor Chandra Kochhar was forced out due to money laundering allegations, wavering investors' confidence to a low. But Bakhshi took ICICI Bank from third-largest lender in India by m-cap to second-largest (next only to HDFC Bank).  ICICI Bank's m-cap rose to Rs 8.09 lakh crore in 2024 from Rs 2.01 lakh crore in 2018, outpacing State Bank of India's Rs 7.36 lakh crore m-cap, showed data from Bloomberg. Stock also saw a stellar rally, giving over 200 percent returns in the span of 6 years.    &amp;nbsp;  &quot;Bakhshi has done a wonderful job in the last six years. He has revamped retail lending, deepened bank's reach across geographies, improved profitability, and brought down bad loans,&quot; said Jignesh Shial, Director - Research and Head of BFSI Sector at InCred Capital.  Dnyanada Vaidya, BFSI Research Analyst at Axis Securities also agreed. She said the since 2018 ICICI Bank’s risk-reward metrics turned favourable and the bank has delivered an all-round performance across operational metrics consistently.  ALSO READ: ICICI Bank FY24 – steady show, re-rating to continue  The three-fold jump  Besides, during his tenure, ICICI Bank's bad loans saw a steep decline. The bank’s net non-performing assets (NNPAs) declined tremendously to 0.45 percent in the March-ended quarter of fiscal year 2023-24 (Q4FY24) from 5.43 percent in Q4FY18.    Additionally, the private-sector lender's net interest income jumped over three-fold to Rs 19,092 crore in Q4FY24 from Rs 6,021 crore in Q4FY18, while margins expanded by 120 basis points to 4.4 percent in the last 6 years. Similarly, at 4.86 percent, ICICI Bank's cost of funds were marginally lower than HDFC Bank's 4.9 percent and way better than Axis Bank's 5.4 percent.  The overhang in this picture perfect scenario remains deteriorating current and savings account (CASA) ratio. CASA ratio declined to 38.9 percent in Q4FY24 from 51.7 percent in Q4FY18. But analysts said that this situation was seen across industry as all CASA flows went to term deposits in a rising rate scenario.  Street upbeat on ICICI Bank  With Bakhshi managing to front the ship in smooth waters over the course of 6 years, all brokerages turned favourable on the stock. At present, there were zero 'sell' calls on ICICI Bank, while 'buy' calls stood at 48, and 3 were on 'hold', showed Bloomberg data.    The lender's return on equity (RoE) - which measures how effectively a company generates profit also jumped to 17.2x in 2023 from 5.24x in 2019.  Going ahead, Jefferies analysts see further scope of re-rating in ICICI Bank due to better growth prospects and attractive valuations against peers. &quot;Since valuations are reasonable at 13x FY26, we upgrade FY25/26 EPS by 4 percent each,&quot; they wrote in a recent note, sharing an 'overweight' rating and target price of Rs 1,300 apiece.  Nomura, too, expects the lender to deliver 13 percent profit-after-tax (PAT) compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over FY24-26 after reporting a strong Q4FY24. The brokerage firm shared a 'buy' call with a target price of Rs 1,335 per share.  With the best quality private sector banks – HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank – struggling to perform on the bourses, analysts and fund managers have been increasingly leaning towards ICICI Bank. A leadership change, if it comes through, may leave fund managers with no easy options in the BFSI space.

icici,2024-04-30T15:41:29+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"Jigar Patel advises long positions in YES Bank, holds bullish outlook for ICICI Bank","The investment view for YES Bank spans over the next 8 to 12 months, reflecting a longer-term perspective on the anticipated trajectory of its stock price","On the robust rally of nearly five percent in ICICI Bank after a consolidation phase in the previous session, market analysts observe that the potential movement following a breakout from such consolidation phases could be approximately twice the width of the consolidation range.  Applying this principle to ICICI Bank, &quot;we can reasonably set a target for the stock at around Rs 1,280, Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research, at Anand Rathi said in an interview to Moneycontrol.  Jigar, who has more than nine years of experience in technical research, believes the recent price action of YES Bank indicates a significant development in its long-term trend. Based on this technical analysis, investors may consider initiating long positions in YES Bank within the price range of Rs 25 to 28, he advises.  What is your trading strategy for ICICI Bank and State Bank of India?  ICICI Bank  After a prolonged period of consolidation lasting 32 trading sessions, during which ICICI Bank's stock price traded within a relatively narrow range of Rs 1,050 to Rs 1,120, a significant development has occurred. The stock has successfully breached this consolidation range and is currently hovering around the Rs 1,160 level.  From a technical standpoint, market analysts often observe that the potential movement following a breakout from such consolidation phases could be approximately twice the width of the consolidation range. Applying this principle to ICICI Bank, we can reasonably set a target for the stock at around Rs 1,280. This target reflects the anticipated magnitude of the breakout move beyond the previous range. In light of this bullish outlook, a strategy of buying on dips is recommended for investors interested in entering or increasing their positions in ICICI Bank.    State Bank of India  In the case of State Bank of India (SBIN), there has been a notable upward movement, amounting to a 100-point increase over the past seven trading sessions. This surge translates to a substantial gain of approximately 13 percent to 14 percent. However, it's crucial to note the emergence of a Bearish Butterfly pattern near the Rs 835-840 zone on the chart. The presence of this pattern typically indicates a potential reversal in the ongoing upside, suggesting that the stock's upward momentum might be losing steam.  Given this technical signal, investors may consider the prudent strategy of booking profits on their SBIN positions. By doing so, they secure gains accrued during the recent bullish phase. Subsequently, investors can adopt a wait-and-watch approach, anticipating a meaningful correction in the stock's price. This approach allows investors to capitalise on potential buying opportunities that may arise as the stock retraces from its current elevated levels. Overall, this strategy aims to strike a balance between realising profits and positioning oneself advantageously for future market movements.    Do you advise taking exposure to YES Bank and IREDA?  YES Bank  The recent price action of YES Bank indicates a significant development in its long-term trend. After enduring a prolonged period of downward pressure, symbolised by a bearish trendline that persisted for 3.5 years, YES Bank's stock price has managed to break above this formidable resistance level. What's particularly noteworthy is that the stock has not only breached this long-standing bear line but has also retraced to retest it from above. This retest serves as a crucial confirmation that the breakout is indeed genuine, strengthening the conviction in the bullish outlook for YES Bank.  Based on this technical analysis, investors may consider initiating long positions in YES Bank within the price range of Rs 25 to 28. The upside potential for the stock is estimated to be around Rs 41, representing a substantial increase from current levels. However, it's important to manage risk effectively in trading or investing. Therefore, a prudent approach would involve placing a stop-loss order near Rs 19 on a daily closing basis. This investment view spans over the next 8 to 12 months, reflecting a longer-term perspective on the anticipated trajectory of YES Bank's stock price.    IREDA  Currently, IREDA (Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency) is encountering significant resistance around the upper boundary of the Bollinger Bands, a technical indicator that depicts volatility and potential price levels. This resistance is reinforced by the presence of a bearish candlestick formation, which typically suggests selling pressure in the market. The conjunction of these two factors indicates a challenging environment for further upward movement in the stock's price in the immediate term.  Consequently, it is advisable for investors to exercise patience and await a pullback in the stock's price. This pullback is expected to lead the price down to around the Rs 160 level, offering a more favourable entry point for initiating long positions.

Also, prices have just given a close above the channel resistance. However, for confirmation about the breakout we need follow up buying.  In short, ICICI Bank looks bullish.

Supreme Industries  Supreme Industries has been moving higher recently and intact in strong uptrend. Price has closed above Rs 4,750 level which confirms breakout of the rounding bottom pattern.  Along with this, KST (know sure thing) has turned above signal line and also trading above the zero line which is a positive sign. So, we can expect good momentum to continue in this stock.  In short, trend for this stock is positive. Use dips towards Rs 4,850-4,900 as a buying opportunity for a move towards Rs 5,450-5,500 levels as long as Rs 4,650 holds on the downside.    BLS International Services  Looking at the daily chart, prices formed a triangle pattern. A breakout of the triangle pattern is expected. After breakout, we can expect a move towards important resistance which is near Rs 372 levels. The RSI (relative strength index) momentum indicator also trading above its median at 56.54 indicating bullish momentum for the stock.  In short, the overall outlook for BLS International is positive. A breach above Rs 353 can lift the price higher towards Rs 372-380 as long as Rs 339 holds on the downside.

For FY24, Bank reported superior RoA at 2.3% vs 2.2% in FY23. Credit growth moderated a bit, to 16% YoY/3% QoQ, but retail loan growth was strong at 19% YoY/4% QoQ and now constitutes 55% of the overall book. This, coupled with sharp jump in CASA ratio (400bps QoQ), aided margins (down only 3bps QoQ to 4.4%). Headline GNPA/NNPA ratio has moderated to a low of 2.2%/0.4%, while Bank holds the peer-best specific PCR at 81% and contingent buffer at 1.1% of loans, which should keep LLP contained and thus support RoA. ICICIB remains our preferred pick in the banking space, given its superior returns profile (RoA: &amp;gt;2%), top-management credibility, and strong capital/provision buffers.

The guidelines, RBI said, have been introduced to address concerns about potential evergreening through this route.  Regulated entities (REs) shall not make investments in any scheme of AIF that has downstream investments either directly or indirectly in a debtor company of the RE. The RBI said lenders need to liquidate their investment in the scheme within 30 days of the AIF scheme, in which lenders are already investors, and makes a downstream investment in any such debtor company, the RBI said.

However, analysts predict stable asset quality, with contained slippages and provisions.","ICICI Bank is expected to report subdued Q4 earnings, with income and profit flat or up a little, as continued margin compression offsets sustained loan growth. However, asset quality would remain stable, with slippages and provisions likely to have been contained, according to analysts.  The lender is set to report its Q4 results on April 27.  The ICICI Bank stock ended at Rs 1,110.75 on the NSE on April 26, down 0.3 percent from the previous close. It has risen more than 11 percent since January, outperforming the Nifty 50, which has gained over 3 percent.  ICICI Bank’s net interest income is likely to rise 1.7 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 18,958 crore in the fourth quarter, according to the median estimate of seven brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.  “In a quarter impacted by tight liquidity and continued pressure on deposits, sequential decline in NIMs (net interest margins) is a given -- more so for private banks,” JM Financial said in a pre-earnings note.  Pre-provisions operating profit (PPoP) will remain flattish -- up 0.6 percent on-quarter at Rs 14,806 crore during the January-March quarter. ICICI Bank’s Q4 net profit is likely to remain little changed at Rs 10,331 crore -- up 0.6 percent from the previous quarter.   ICICI Bank Q4 FY24 Results Estimates | NII seen marginally up, Net Profit seen flattish  Banks in India are under sustained pressure to mobilise low-cost deposits. Instead, they are having to depend on high-cost funds to feed the growing demand for credit, which is hurting their margins.  Last week, HDFC Bank reported a largely stable net interest margin for the quarter as India’s largest private sector lender focussed on mobilising deposits over growing the loan book aggressively.  Sustained loan growth  However, ICICI Bank is likely to sustain loan growth, taking a small hit on the net interest margin due to the higher cost of funds.  “While loan growth could come in at 4.3 percent (quarter-on-quarter), we expect net interest income to remain flattish QoQ due to net interest margin decline of 14 bps QoQ, led by faster rise in cost of funds,” Prabhudas Lilladher said in a note.  Dolat Capital said ICICI Bank’s loan growth would sustain at 4 percent QoQ but net interest margin would decline, led by &quot;higher cost of funds.&quot;  Kotak Securities expects net interest margin to decline by ~20 bps quarter-on-quarter to 4.3 percent.  However, the quantum of margin compression for ICICI Bank is likely to be lower in the latest fiscal quarter, said Axis Securities, adding that deposit growth is expected to improve sequentially.  Stable asset quality  Axis Securities expects &quot;no challenges&quot; on ICICI Bank’s asset quality, and most brokerages suggest cautious optimism regarding provisions, with a keen eye on slippages. Emkay Research said it expects slippages to moderate quarter-on-quarter due to the absence of lumpy corporate non-performing assets.  Lower slippages would lead to lower provisions.  “We expect provisions to remain low as we see lower slippages, given the current economic environment,” said Kotak Securities. “We are building in slippages of about 2 percent (or about Rs 50 billion),” it added.  Further, the reversal of provisions made in the previous quarter (Q3) could aid earnings, said Dolat Capital. The reversal of alternative investment fund-related provisions would also lower credit costs, added Axis Securities.  What to watch  A key concern would be the progress of net interest margin as the cost of funds is yet to peak, especially with slower CASA (current account and savings account) growth, said Kotak Securities.  Deposit mobilisation is likely to be another key area of interest for investors.

To be on a safer side card users should block the card and replace it; this will provide some relief.","On April 24, several ICICI Bank credit card customers complained on social media that they could view other customers' ICICI Bank credit cards on their iMobile Pay app.  Since the full card number, expiry date and CVV were visible on the app, it would be easy for someone to change the security settings and misuse another person's credit card for overseas transactions.  “It's a security glitch on ICICI Bank’s iMobile Pay app,” said Sumanta Mandal, founder of TechnoFino, a platform that reviews debit and credit cards.  What is iMobile Pay app?  iMobile Pay is ICICI Bank’s official mobile banking app which offers 400+ banking services. It is accessible to both ICICI Bank customers and non-ICICI Bank customers.  Using the app, customers can manage multiple cards, transfer funds, apply for loans, open fixed and recurring deposits and more.  Bank’s statement  Responding to queries from Moneycontrol, an ICICI Bank spokesperson said the glitch was due to 17,000 new credit cards that were issued in the past few days and erroneously mapped to wrong users.  The affected credit cards constituted about 0.1 percent of the bank’s credit card portfolio. No instance of card misuse from this set was reported, the spokesperson added.  As an immediate measure, ICICI Bank blocked these cards and is issuing new ones to the customers. The bank has also restricted access to credit card details on the iMobile Pay app for everyone.  Also read | Action on Kotak Mahindra Bank signals RBI's intent to address systemic gaps in banking, say experts  What customers should do?  Since the card was accessible to others, they could have changed the settings on the iMobile Pay app without an OTP or even an MPIN.  “The best option is to block the card and replace it - this will provide some relief,” said Mandal.  In case of any financial loss, you should reach out to the bank by calling customer care or use internet banking to block the card and make a complaint of financial loss with proof of the transaction on email/messages.  “We assure that the bank will appropriately compensate a customer in case of any financial loss,” the spokesperson from ICICI Bank said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/icici-bank-app-glitch-exposes-credit-cards-what-customers-should-do-12708236.html
icici,2024-04-24T12:13:21+05:30,Anishaa Kumar,Minority shareholders contemplating action over ICICI Bank's delisting plan of I-Sec,"ICICI Bank is planning to delist ICICI Securities, making it a 100 percent subsidiary of the bank. Quantum MF is among the shareholders opposing the move. They have raised concerns over the valuation as well as the merger process.","Minority shareholders are contemplating next steps to counter ICICI Banks' plan to delist ICICI Securities, making it a 100 percent subsidiary of the bank.  Talking to Moneycontrol on April 24, minority shareholder Manu Rishi Gupta said that they are still contemplating the next course of action but reiterated that shareholders are feeling terribly short-changed and cheated as all their representations have pretty much fallen on deaf ears.  &quot;At this instance, it's all a strong conjecture. We will wait and watch for the response from the two institutions. In the meanwhile, we sincerely hope that the conscience of the two boards gets stirred and they do the thing that's right , fair , ethical and morally correct,&quot; Gupta noted.  ICICI Securities said that 83.8 percent of the institutional investors voted in favour of the scheme, while 67.8 percent of the non-institutional investors voted against the demerger.  In an eight-page letter to ICICI Bank and the regulator on April 10, Quantum Mutual Fund's Managing Director and CEO, Jimmy A Patel, said that the fund house had raised various concerns on the valuation as well as the process put in place.  Also read: Quantum Mutual Fund votes against ICICI Bank and ICICI Securities merger  Quantum MF is a minority shareholder with about 0.09 percent stake in ICICI Securities through Quantum Long Term Equity Fund and Quantum ELSS Tax Saver Fund.  It had requested ICICI Bank and ICICI Securities to respond to their queries within five days and refrain from taking action on the scheme of merger.  Under the scheme of merger, around Rs 1,780 crore will be transferred to ICICI Bank shareholders from I-Sec minority shareholders.  Quantum MF had previously raised these concerns with the management of I-Sec on December 28, 2023, and ICICI Bank on March 5, 2024, asking them to &quot;redo their valuation&quot;.  They estimate that the  swap ratio will lead to a net loss of at least Rs 1776.7 crore to I-Sec minority shareholders, including around Rs 6.1 crore to the unit holders of the schemes of Quantum MF.  Also read: ICICI Bank faces backlash for attempting to sway minority voters on ICICI Securities' delisting  What are the concerns?  On the swap ratio, concerns have been raised that the valuation reports dated June 29, 2023, could not have been used to determine it during the March 27, 2024 meeting.  These reports, Quantum MF says, fail to account for the various changes that have taken place in the market over the last nine months, thereby making the valuation inaccurate. I-Sec has been valued around Rs 628 per share.  Quantum also noted that the bull market rally over the last nine months have been in favour of I-Sec but has not been factored in. &quot;As per our assessment, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ending March 2023, I-Sec has started expanding its retail cash market volume share of the broking business. I-Sec has also seen a spectacular 66 percent growth in net profits for the quarter ending December 2023. However, the share price has barely moved due to the cap limit placed by the arbitrary and unjust swap ratio,&quot; the letter noted.  The third concern was that the valuation for ICICI Securities was done by comparing it to its peers. I-Sec has been valued at a 30-77 percent discount to its listed peers, based on the consensus earnings forecast for FY2024. Quantum notes that, even if one were to take the lowest valuation of its peers, in this case, Angel One at 24x, the merger offer would have been at least 30 percent higher.     Attempt to influence shareholders?  Minority shareholders have also raised concerns that prior to the board meeting, ICICI Securities and ICICI Bank had been contacting retail shareholders of I-Sec and &quot;coaxing them to vote in favour of the scheme of merger.&quot;  In a clarification to the exchanges, ICICI Bank had said that the &quot;outreach programme was to encourage more voting&quot; and not to influence their decision-making. Quantum MF, in its letter, called the clarification a &quot;smokescreen&quot; and an attempt to hide the &quot;mala fide&quot; motives of I-Sec.  &quot;Based on a prima facie perusal of the clarification response, there is no justifiable reason provided to the query raised by the stock exchanges. The notice convening the shareholder's meeting had already been issued in February 2024 itself, and, therefore, there could have been no reason to contact the shareholders separately,&quot; they noted.  Gupta added that the actions have also led to minority shareholder data being compromised as the calls were made by ICICI Bank and not even by ICICI Securities, which means that the details were shared with them.  &quot;When I sought the shareholder register around months ago, by paying the required fees and by following due process, I received only names and the email addresses. How do other people in the public domain get the phone numbers? We believe that obviously someone is not acting in the right manner,&quot; he said.  Speaking to Moneycontrol, Quantum MF also said that as of now, they are considering all options to protect their shareholder interest.

icici,2024-04-22T09:08:44+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Experts bet on these 10 stocks that may outperform market with healthy returns,"Experts say 22,300 is expected to be crucial hurdle for further upside in the Nifty 50 as the closing above can lift the index towards 22,500 mark","The market corrected 1.65 percent in the week ended April 19, but the strong recovery in the last session of the week minimised the losses and gave a bit of confidence to Dalal Street. The formation of bullish piercing line and double bottom kind of patterns on the daily charts indicated a positive bias for the coming sessions, though there may be volatility due to expiry of April derivative contracts in the current week.  Hence, 22,300 is expected to be a crucial hurdle for further upside in the Nifty 50 as the closing above can lift the index towards 22,500 mark, whereas 22,000 is expected to be an immediate support for the index as breaking the same can open doors for 21,800-21,700 levels again, experts said.  In week ended April 19, the Nifty 50 declined 372 points to 22,147 level and formed a bullish candlestick pattern with a long lower shadow on the weekly charts.  &quot;Though it would be early to claim that we are completely out of the woods and, hence, caution is warranted. As far as levels are concerned, the psychological mark of 22,000 withholds the intermediate support, followed by the strong support of the 21,800-21,700 subzone,&quot; Osho Krishan, senior analyst for technical and derivative research at Angel One, aid.  On the higher end, he feels the 20 DEMA (day exponential moving average) placed at 22,300, followed by a bearish gap of 22,430-22,500, is likely to act as a daunting task in the near period and an authoritative breakthrough could only re-strengthen the lost momentum to the bulls of Dalal Street.  According to Nagaraj Shetti, senior technical research analyst at HDFC Securities, the short-term trend remains weak, but, having placed near the cluster support of around 22,000 level, one may expect upside bounce from the lows in coming sessions.  It is advisable to avoid aggressive overnight bets and patiently wait for the uncertainty to cool down, Osho said.  Moneycontrol collated a list of top 10 stock ideas from experts with three-four weeks perspective. The closing price of April 19 is considered for stock price return calculation.  Expert: Subash Gangadharan, senior technical/derivative analyst at HDFC Securities  Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,189 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,950 | Target: Rs 2,500 | Return: 14 percent  The recent downward correction seems to have halted. The stock has bounced back from the low of Rs 1,795, which is close to its previous intermediate lows and also to the 50-week SMA (simple moving average). The stock has been consolidating for the last two weeks above the 20 day and 50-day SMA.  Given the positive technical set up, we believe it is a matter of time before it starts moving higher. Buying can be initiated at CMP (Rs 2189), and more can be added on dips down to Rs 2,125. Upside target is at Rs 2,500 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 1,950.    Titagarh Rail Systems: Buy | LTP: Rs 972 | Stop-Loss: Rs 850 | Target: Rs 1,150 | Return: 18 percent  After a sharp fall in the stock recently that saw it testing a low of Rs 780 and near the 50-week SMA, Titagarh has bounced back gradually over the last few weeks. The stock has taken out its recent swing high of Rs 980 in the process.  Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI (relative strength index) too have bounced back strongly from oversold levels.  With the intermediate technical set up too looking encouraging, one may look to buy Titagarh at CMP (Rs 972), add more on dips down to Rs 940 and wait for the upside target of Rs 1,150 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 850.    ITD Cementation: Buy | LTP: Rs 362 | Stop-Loss: Rs 320 | Target: Rs 420 | Return: 16 percent  The stock is now in a healthy short term uptrend after making a double bottom pattern around Rs 260 levels. Last week, the stock has broken out of its recent trading range on the back of healthy volumes, which augurs well for the uptrend to continue.  Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20-day SMA and momentum indicators like the 14-day RSI are in rising mode and have crossed their previous highs, suggesting that momentum is picking up.  Buying can be initiated at CMP (Rs 362), and more can be added on dips down to Rs 345. Upside target is at Rs 420 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 320.    Expert: Amol Athawale, VP-technical research at Kotak Securities  SAIL: Buy | LTP: Rs 146 | Stop-Loss: Rs 140 | Target: Rs 156 | Return: 7 percent  After the remarkable up move of the last few weeks, the counter (Steel Authority of India) witnessed short-term correction from the higher levels. However, closing above the important retracement zone on the daily scale suggest bullish continuation chart formation.  Therefore, the counter is likely to resume its uptrend from the current levels in the near term.    ICICI Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,067 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,030 | Target: Rs 1,150 | Return: 8 percent  After the recent selloff in the counter from the higher levels, the downward momentum had stopped. On daily charts, the counter has found support and reversed its trend from its important support zone along with Bullish Piercing Line candlestick pattern. The formation suggests at further bullish movement from the current levels.    Bharat Electronics: Buy | LTP: Rs 233 | Stop-Loss: Rs 223 | Target: Rs 250 | Return: 7 percent  On the weekly charts, the counter is into a rising channel chart formation with higher high and higher low series pattern. Additionally, the technical indicators like ADX (average directional index) and RSI is also indicating further up trend from current levels which could boost the bullish momentum in the near future.    Expert: Riyank Arora, technical analyst at Mehta Equities  Imagicaaworld Entertainment: Buy | LTP: Rs 82.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 74 | Target: Rs 90/100 | Return: 21 percent  The stock has touched its important anchor VWAP (volume-weighted average price) support mark of Rs 80.00 on both its daily and weekly charts. With the RSI (14) on daily charts at 52.74, overall momentum is expected to pick up well in the stock.  A strict stop-loss should be kept at Rs 74 mark for potential upside targets of Rs 90 and Rs 100. A strong technical structure with minimal risk makes Imagicaa a strong buy at current levels.    Lupin: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,548 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,590 | Target: Rs 1,450 | Return: 6 percent  The stock has given a good breakdown below its immediate support mark of Rs 1,553 on its daily charts. With the RSI (14) near 37.10 and volumes in Friday's session equivalent to its average (30) days volume, it is expected that the stock should head lower towards potential targets of Rs 1,450 and below.  A strict stop-loss should be kept at the Rs 1,590 mark to manage risk well on the short.    By Om Mehra, technical analyst at SAMCO Securities  Bharat Dynamics: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,833 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,750 | Target: Rs 1,980 | Return: 8 percent  The stock of Bharat Dynamics (BDL) has bounced after forming a double bottom pattern in a daily time frame with significant volumes. The stock appears to be strongly placed above the middle Bollinger band and RSI remains above 60 levels.  If the stock manages to close above the Rs 1,850 level, it could move higher further. Hence, based on the above technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP Rs 1,833 for a target price of Rs 1,980. The stop-loss can be kept at Rs 1,750.    CG Power and Industrial Solutions: Buy | LTP: Rs 534 | Stop-Loss: Rs 505 | Target: Rs 580 | Return: 8.6 percent  The stock has rebounded strongly from its support zone, accompanied by significant volumes over the past few days. Strengthening indicators include the RSI holding steady at 64 levels. Additionally, the previous resistance has now become support confirms a bullish setup.  Hence, based on the above technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP Rs 531, for a target price of Rs 580. The stop-loss can be kept at Rs 505.

This trend is likely to continue,&quot; said VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.  Analysts are finding comfort in the large-cap banking stocks in the current market, especially since expectations of the upcoming quarterly results of the banking majors are likely to be very positive.  The stocks with the highest number of 'buy' calls by various domestic and international brokerages are the banking behemoths: ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank.    ICICI Bank has the highest number of 'buy' calls, with 49 brokerages recommending investors buy stocks of the counter, while only three experts have a 'hold' call.  Private sector lenders, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank both have 45 buy recommendations, with four and five 'hold' calls.  Over the past year, Axis Bank has outperformed the Bank Nifty index, gaining around 23 percent. Experts are hoping for the lender to see better loan growth, and are bullish on the stock's attractive valuations.  However, shares of HDFC Bank have slipped into the red over the past year, falling more than 8 percent, despite the optimism surrounding the counter.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live updates  Though HDFC Bank's earnings following its reverse merger with its parent HDFC have disappointed, analysts are positive on its structural story remaining positive, as its portfolio mix is slowly shifting to retail lending.  IndusInd Bank boasts of 44 'buy' calls, with one 'sell' and four 'hold' recommendations. Analysts are bullish on the lender's net interest income, with a Jefferies report stating that the lender's NII growth was among the best across coverage.  Brokerages are also very bullish on auto major Maruti Suzuki. The counter has 41 'buy', six 'hold' and three 'sell' calls. In a note on April 9, international brokerage Morgan Stanley said a global slowdown in EVs shows that the powertrain technology strategy which Maruti Suzuki has is the best to navigate the current landscape as hybrids are seen as an attractive bridge in the EV transition globally.  The other counters that see maximum optimism from brokerages are public lender, State Bank of India, Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra, UltraTech Cement, ITC, and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries.

The bank has been facing backlash for attempting to sway minority voters on delisting proposal for ICICI Securities . “The approach in the outreach was to explain the proposed scheme and facilitate voting, and to not pursue repeated engagement if declined by the shareholder,” the bank said in a stock exchange filing.  &quot;As may be seen from the voting period dates mentioned above, March 23 (Saturday), March 24 (Sunday) and March 25 (Holi), were holidays in all or substantial parts of the country.

Defending the proposed scheme, it said four independent proxy advisory firms recommended voting for the resolution to approve the proposed scheme to shareholders of both ICICI Bank and ICICI Securities.  “A concerted campaign against the proposal, using social media and involving extensive outreach to retail shareholders, was undertaken by those opposed to the proposed Scheme.”  ICICI Securities shareholders had taken to X platform (formerly Twitter) to complain about the relentless calls received from ICICI Bank's managers and branch officers.

Besides being more liquid, large caps also appear attractively valued compared to the second-line stocks that have suddenly fallen out of favour ","When the market was on an upswing, mid-cap and small-cap indices had outpaced the Sensex and Nifty by a mile. A similar trend is playing out on the way down as well. So far this week, the mid and small-cap indices have fallen by as much as 9 percent, compared to a 2 percent decline in the bigger indices.  Analysts expect this divergence to continue as they see panic-stricken investors flocking to the safety of large-caps. Besides being more liquid, large-caps also appear attractively valued compared to the second-line stocks that have suddenly fallen out of favour.  Top large-cap stocks experts are betting on  Deven Mehata, Equity Research Analyst, Choice Broking  Maruti Buy: Rs 11,400 | Stop Loss: Rs 11,000 | Target: Rs 12,300  The stock is trading very close to its all-time high of 11,730 at 11,400 levels. The critical support level at 11,000, closely aligned with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), signifies historical buying interest and provides a foundation for the stock's price stability. Crucially, Maruti is trading above all significant moving averages, emphasising its underlying strength and positive sentiment.  On the higher side, once the stock surpasses 11,730 resistance, it can move towards 12,300 levels and higher. Meanwhile, 11,000 serves as a potential stop for downward movements. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 54.96, indicating a supportive environment for price gains. It's not yet in overbought territory, suggesting room for further growth.  L&amp;amp;T Buy: Rs 3,550 | Stop Loss: Rs 3,400 | Target: Rs 3,730 - 3,900  The stock has found substantial support around 3,400 levels. The recent robust bounce from this support suggests a bullish stance for LT. The potential for further upward movement, potentially reaching new all-time highs, is underlined by the stock's resilience at key support levels.  A breakthrough above the resistance at 3,635 could catalyze a strong upward movement, approaching the all-time high levels of 3,730 and beyond. This analysis suggests a favorable outlook for LT, supported by technical indicators pointing towards potential bullish momentum in the upcoming sessions.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live action  Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel One  TCS Buy: Rs 4,200 - 4,100 | Stop Loss: Rs 3,940 | Target: Rs 4,750  The IT giant has experienced an impressive rally in recent months, breaking out of a prolonged consolidation phase. While the broader market has been under pressure in the last few sessions, this particular stock has shown remarkable resilience and is now trading in uncharted levels. Looking at the weekly chart, we can see that prices have surged past a significant consolidation breakout pattern known as the 'saucer' formation.  Following this breakout, any minor pullbacks or consolidation phases have been met with buying interest. Despite indicators signaling overbought conditions, they also reflect the stock's underlying strength. Traders are advised to consider purchasing this stock at its current market price or on any subsequent dips.  HDFC Bank Buy: Rs 1,445 - 1,420 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,360 | Target: Rs 1,600  This prominent banking heavyweight has been a key contributor to the recent underperformance of the Bank Nifty. However, amid the recent market turmoil, this stock has shown resilience, displaying a relatively muted reaction and appears to be establishing a support base at attractive levels. This consolidation phase aligns with the long-term support of the 200-weekly moving average and is accompanied by robust trading volumes.  There's notable positive divergence evident, wherein although prices have reached new lows, oscillators have not, suggesting substantial accumulation of this stock at lower levels. Additionally, the recent closure of prices above the 20-day exponential moving average (20EMA) on the daily chart indicates a shift towards positive momentum in the short term. Given these factors and the favorable reward-to-risk ratio, we maintain a strong bullish outlook on this stock.

The recent increase was supported by a rise in volume. Furthermore, the stock has moved above the near-term moving average.  Additionally, a positive divergence is evident in the RSI, indicating a bullish shift in price momentum. In the short term, the stock may continue its upward movement with the potential to reach towards 460. Support on the lower end is situated at 400.  Bharti Airtel Buy: Rs 1,200-1,205 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,174 | Target: Rs 1,260  The stock has defied the overall market trend by remaining above the critical moving average. Additionally, it has sustained its position above the recent consolidation level.  The RSI indicates a positive crossover. Over the short term, the stock may continue its upward trajectory with the potential to reach towards 1250-1260. Support on the lower end is situated at 1174.  ICICI Bank Buy: Rs 1,070-1,080 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,049 | Target: Rs 1,230  The stock has maintained higher top higher bottom formation on the daily timeframe.

icici,2024-03-14T17:11:45+05:30,Yogesh Supekar,Proxy advisors say ‘yes’ to ICICI Securities delisting,"The merger is expected to capitalise on the synergies between ICICI Bank and ICICI Securities, driving operational efficiencies and streamlining processes. ","Four prominent proxy advisory firms—InGovern, SES, IiAS and ISS-- have favoured the scheme of arrangement that proposed delisting of equity shares of ICICI Securities by issuing equity shares of its parent, ICICI Bank, to the shareholders of ICICI Securities. By virtue of the delisting, ICICI Securities will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICICI Bank.  In separate notes, these advisory firms have recommended the special resolution that proposed delisting of shares of ICICI Securities. The shareholders of ICICI Bank and ICICI Securities are slated to meet on March 27, 2024 separately to transact the proposed scheme.  Under the proposed scheme, the public shareholders of ICICI Securities will receive 67 equity shares of ICICI Bank for every 100 equity shares held in ICICI Securities. The proposed scheme of arrangement has been approved by the Board of Directors of both companies, and stock exchanges.  According to InGovern, over a period of six months prior to the date of announcement of delisting i.e. from December 28, 2022 to June 28, 2023, the average ratio of VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price) of ICICI Securities stock price to the VWAP of ICICI Bank stock price is 0.54. The proposed swap ratio of 0.67 represents a premium of 24.07% to this. The VWAP ratio during the period from June 28, 2023 to March 9, 2024 is 0.70 which closely mirrors the swap ratio offered by the company to its shareholders, said the InGovern report.  The InGovern report also added that the broking business is inherently volatile. By being offered shares of the comparatively stable shareholding in the parent company, shareholders of ICICI Securities gain from enhanced liquidity and better price discovery.  The combined entity with the strategic imperative of combining wealth management, broking services with banking services will fuel growth and profitability, the InGovern report added.  SES said that in the case of listed companies, the market price is the best measure for determining fairness of any exchange ratio, provided that shares of both the entities have liquidity on exchanges where they are listed and nature of entity is not changing drastically, say from a PSU to private, or MNC etc. In this case, both the shares are liquid and ownership remains with the public at large with no change in the nature of ownership.  In order to estimate the fairness of the exchange ratio, SES has considered the undisturbed share price data of both the companies for a year preceding the scheme intimation date.  The average ratio of market share prices of ICICI Securities to ICICI Bank for the preceding year stood at 0.56 times, whereas the proposed share swap ratio is 0.67:1. Hence, it appears that shareholders of ICICI Securities are paid a slight premium vis-à-vis the market price differential. The ratio of price as on date of valuation report was close to 0.67 considering the undisturbed price, setting aside the minor difference based on average price, according to SES.  According to IiAS, banks in India mostly run broking business through privately held arms. To this extent, delisting of ICICI Securities and keeping it as a separate legal entity within the ICICI Bank fold will align it with market practices, it added.  The international advisory firm ISS said, given the cyclical nature of ICICI Securities’ business, being part of ICICI Bank with a larger customer ecosystem could bring stability to the stock broking company’s financial performance.  &amp;nbsp;  The merger is expected to capitalise on the synergies between ICICI Bank and ICICI Securities, driving operational efficiencies and streamlining processes. With ICICI Securities set to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICICI Bank, the combined entity aims to better capitalise on the synergies of ICICI Bank.

icici,2024-03-14T05:52:19+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"Trade Spotlight | Your strategy for ICICI Bank, ITC, Coal India today","ICICI Bank was the outperformer, forming bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts after Doji or High Wave kind of pattern formation in previous session, with above average volumes. The stock still traded above all key moving averages.","In the face of major selling pressure after seven weeks, the mood turned cautious at Dalal Street. Hence, the consolidation around 22,000 mark can be possible on the Nifty 50 in the coming sessions and, in case the index decisively breaks 21,860 points, further sharp selling pressure can't be ruled out, given the breakdown of higher highs, higher lows formation, but if the index rebounds, it may face hurdle at 22,200-22,300 on the higher side, experts said.  On March 13, the Nifty 50 dropped 338 points or 1.51 percent (the biggest single day loss since January 23 this year) to close at 21,998, and formed a large bearish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe with higher volumes.  The BSE Sensex was down more than 900 points or 1.23 percent to 72,762, but the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices hit hard, falling 4.4 percent and 5.3 percent on disappointing breadth.  Stocks selected for trade spotlight segment included ICICI Bank, ITC, and Coal India. ICICI Bank was the outperformer, rising 0.66 percent to Rs 1,084 and forming a bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts after Doji or High Wave kind of pattern formation in previous session, with above average volumes. The stock still traded above all key moving averages.  ITC was the star performer of the day among largecaps, rising 4.5 percent to Rs 422.5, but formed a long, bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts as the closing was lower than opening levels. The stock climbed 8 percent in morning trade, but could not sustain all gains and, as a result, fell below all key moving averages.  Coal India has seen a breakdown of horizontal support trendline as well as 21-day EMA and 50-day EMA (exponential moving averages) and formed a long, bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with above average volumes, but on 15 minutes charts, the buying was visible in the counter in late trade with positive crossover in RSI (relative strength index). The stock was down 7.2 percent at Rs 417.  Here's what Jigar S Patel of Anand Rathi Shares &amp;amp; Stock Brokers recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  ITC  After reaching a peak near Rs 475 mark on January 4, 2024, ITC has experienced a significant decline of approximately 75 rupees, which represents a decline of approximately 16 percent. However, in the subsequent 18 trading sessions, ITC has shown stability by avoiding further declines and has instead consolidated within a range of Rs 400-416.  Notably, in the previous trading session, there was notable buying interest observed at lower levels, accompanied by substantial trading volume. From a technical standpoint, the formation of a bullish AB=CD pattern on the daily chart of ITC within the mentioned price zone of Rs 400-416.  Interestingly, this zone also coincides with the 0.382 percent retracement level of a price swing that occurred between January 2023 and July 2023, as indicated on the chart. Additionally, it has formed complex structure forming on the daily relative strength index (RSI) indicator, resembling a 'W shape' below the 30 level, which suggests a potentially lucrative buying opportunity.  Thus one can buy in the zone of Rs 415-425 with an upside target of Rs 475 and a stop-loss would be placed near Rs 390 on a daily close basis.    ICICI Bank  Over the past two weeks, ICICI Bank has maintained a narrow trading range between Rs 1,133 and Rs 1,055, leading to the emergence of a candlestick pattern resembling a shooting star on the weekly chart. This formation, coupled with the occurrence of a negative cross in the weekly stochastics near the chart's peak, presents an early cautionary signal for bullish investors.  As a result, it may be prudent for traders to consider booking profits within the range of Rs 1,090-1,100 and exercise caution against initiating new long positions, opting instead to await a more substantial correction in the market.    Coal India  Following a peak near Rs 465 mark on March 7, 2024, Coal India underwent a notable decline of approximately 55 rupees, marking a significant drop of around 12 percent. However, from a technical perspective, a bullish AB=CD pattern has emerged on the 2-hourly chart of Coal India within the price range of Rs 410-420. Remarkably, this range aligns with the 0.50 percent retracement level of a price swing observed between January 2024 and February 2024, as depicted on the chart.  Furthermore, a bullish cross has been observed on the 2-hourly Stochastic indicator, signaling a potentially attractive buying opportunity. Consequently, investors may consider initiating long positions within Rs 410-420 zone, targeting an upside objective of Rs 450. It's advisable to set a stop-loss near Rs 397 on a daily closing basis to manage downside risk effectively.

","Mumbai-headquartered ICICI Bank has clarified that it has launched a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi to look into allegations raised by a customer of a Rs 16-crore fraud in her account by a branch manager.  &quot;As an aggrieved party, we have lodged a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police for a thorough investigation into the matter which appears to be much more than meets the eye. We are extending full co-operation to the police investigation,&quot; the bank told Moneycontrol.  Shveta Sharma, a resident of Gurugram, filed a complained with the Economic Offences Wing in Delhi on January 29, alleging that an ICICI Bank official moved her account from old Gurgaon to Vikaspuri without her consent and siphoned off money from there. She raised a claim of Rs 16 crore from the bank in her complaint.  The branch manager of the Vikaspuri Branch was subsequently suspended by ICICI Bank, though Sharma's complaint had named 11 bank officials who had interacted with her.  ICICI Bank denied going into details on the ongoing investigation. &quot;We refrain from commenting on the ongoing investigation. However, in response to the insinuations raised in your queries, which you got from the customer, we would like to draw your attention to the following points,&quot; the bank told Moneycontrol, listing out its argument.  The mobile number and email ID of her account were changed with the customer’s knowledge, it said. &quot;Our records indicate that notifications regarding both the changes were sent to her original mobile number and email address which were registered with the bank.&quot;  ICICI Bank added that they have communicated to the customer that the bank is ready to transfer a sum of Rs 9.27 crore as the disputed amount but she wouldn't be able to to use this money until the probe is over.  The bank mentioned that Sharma had liquidated a fixed deposit of Rs 2 crore to her account.  Asked about the money trail, Sharma said that she had transferred the money from her US bank account to the ICICI Bank account and wanted ICICI Bank to invest it in fixed deposits (FDs).  &quot;ICICI Bank is trying to blame the victim here. Clearly they have committed fraud with wilful intent and this seems to be a systemic problem.

Major challenges include rising pressure on the cost of funds, due to structural funding challenges, and growing concerns on rising consumer leverage, which poses potential asset quality challenges. In unsecured lending, particularly, this could lead to higher credit costs. Further, banks could feel the pressure on operating costs due to elevated wage inflation, and also need to expand the distribution network for future deposit growth, said Goldman Sachs.  Also Read: Private capex is seeing action heat up, here’s a road map for investors  Domestic banks recorded a sharp ROA (return on assets) expansion in FY20-3QFY24. Now, the brokerage believes that ROAs will start moderating due to continued pressure on margins which are expected to extend to FY25, slower loan growth as loan-deposit ratios are stretched and that the sector will have to repair its balance-sheet mix and this, coupled with the need of building capacity, should keep cost-to-income levels elevated.  “We believe all players face the dilemma of maintaining market share or compromising margins amidst the backdrop of stronger balance sheets across the system,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs Equity Research.  However, the brokerage said that an earlier-than-expected cut in policy rates would alleviate liquidity concerns in the system or any measures by the central bank to ease the liquidity through CRR/SLR should aid in deposit growth and would augur well for all private banks in particular which are currently constrained with stretched loans-to-deposit ratios and limited buffers on liquidity coverage ratios and, to a certain extent, for NBFCs which are witnessing an environment of elevated costs of funds due to liquidity tightness.  Goldman Sachs upgraded Bajaj Finance to ‘neutral’ from ‘sell’ (2 percent upside) and reiterated the ‘buy’ call on HDFC Bank (33 percent upside).  Brokerage Call  SBI: Neutral - CMP: Rs 766.95 - Target Price: Rs 741  Goldman Sachs cut State Bank of India’s earnings by 7 percent and 5 percent over FY25E/26E mainly on account of a higher cost of funds and now expects the ROA of the bank to be &amp;lt;1 percent over FY25-26E.  “Since we added the stock to our Buy list on Aug 24 2020, the stock is up 283 percent vs the BSE30 +87 percent. At the current valuation of 1.2x on a 1-yr fwd P/B basis (standalone) and the dynamics around profitability, we believe the stock is trading at a fair valuation. Based on our valuation methodology, we raise our 12-month target price to Rs 741 per share,” the brokerage said while downgrading the stock to ‘Neutral’.  ICICI Bank: Neutral - CMP: Rs 1,061.55 - Target Price: Rs 1,086  “While ICICI Bank has been quite successful in scaling up its ROAs post Covid driven by its shift towards a higher-yielding mix, digital banking which also allowed it to scale up its consumer lending, diversification into SME lending etc, we expect the consumer lending to go through consolidation and hence expect ICICI Bank’s profitability to also moderate,” said Goldman Sachs.  Also Read: Global stocks set for gains, not fireworks, in months ahead: Poll  ICICI Bank has grown its unsecured book quite aggressively (25 percent of incremental loan growth over FY22-23) and with rising delinquencies in this book, the brokerage expects it to also impact its operating profit growth (due to income reversals).  “Since we added it to our buy list on 23 Oct 2016, the stock has risen 315 percent vs the BSE 30 Sensex of 160 percent. We revise our 12-month SOTP to Rs 1,086 from Rs 1,179 and downgrade the stock to ‘Neutral’ from ‘Buy’,” Goldman Sachs said.  Yes Bank: Sell - CMP: Rs 27.25 - Target Price: Rs 16  The stock has rallied 36 percent over the last 3 months and 65 percent over the last 12 months vs Bank Nifty's performance of  +7%/17%. However, the fundamentals have been under pressure due to its subdued margin profile as well as a bottoming of credit cost improvements.  “We believe its ROEs are going to remain sub-par despite improvements due to the above-mentioned challenges and hence the current valuations appear rich. As a result, we downgrade to ‘Sell’ from ‘Neutral’. We cut EPS by 43 percent in FY25 and BVPS by 6.6 percent but maintain our 12-month target price at Rs 16,” said Goldman Sachs.

While this is sentimentally positive for the six stocks in the near term, it does not mean that HDFC's stake will necessarily go up to 9.5 percent in these lenders .  We spoke to analysts and looked into past trends of such RBI approvals. Here is what we found:  What is the RBI approval all about?  The HDFC group as a whole, including HDFC Life, HDFC AMC and HDFC Ergo, can now acquire up to 9.5 percent stake each in six banks - IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Suryoday Small Finance Bank and Bandhan Bank.  A business group cannot hold more than 10 percent stake in a bank. Therefore, approvals are sought for 9.99 percent, the maximum limit.  Despite the perceived intent, it does not mean that full 9.99 percent stake will be acquired. Since it does not make sense to seek RBI approval for every 1-2 percent stake, companies tend to ask for the maximum 9.99 percent.  How much does the HDFC group currently hold in these banks?  At the end of the December quarter, it held 3.43 percent in ICICI Bank, 2.57 percent in Axis Bank, 4.48 percent in IndusInd Bank and 3 percent in Yes Bank.  Why is RBI approval needed?  The RBI's approval is a must for anyone looking to acquire more than 5 percent stake in a bank as it is a highly regulated sector, said Vijay Singh Gour, lead analyst, Choice Broking.  Also Read: China's market restrictions won't help, may be bad for EMs, no immediate impact on India  What is the validity of the approval?  The approval is valid for a year and if HDFC fails to acquire the shareholding within that period, the approval stands cancelled.  If the holding stands at sub-5 percent before the year-end, then RBI’s approval will be required again to increase it to 5 percent or more.  Is this sign of merger?  No. It is simply an approval for investment purpose, clarified Jignesh Shial of Incred Equities.  Other examples...  LIC on January 24 received the RBI's approval to acquire up to 9.99 percent in HDFC Bank. In December 2023, ICICI Prudential AMC got RBI nod to acquire 9.99 percent in Federal Bank.

Banking stocks are seen as reasonably valued bets at a time when the market simmers on high valuations, said analysts.  HDFC, ICICI, SBI as well as LIC are among the domestic institutions to have sought approval from the Reserve Bank of India for raising their stakes in banks up to 9.9 percent. This creates an additional headroom for purchases worth Rs 1.4 lakh crore over the next one year, with regulatory approvals in place.  For the uninitiated, the RBI's prior approval is a must for anyone looking to acquire more than 5 percent stake in a bank as it is a highly regulated sector.    The rush to get approvals for higher stakes started in October 2023 on expectations that the Fed’s pivot to lower rates will prompt foreign investors to come back to Indian markets in a big way.  Also read: HDFC Bank Group gets RBI nod to acquire up to 9.5% stakes in Yes Bank, IndusInd &amp;amp; 4 others  The most recent approval came on February 6 when HDFC group received the RBI nod to acquire up to 9.5 percent in six banks - IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Suryoday Small Finance Bank and Bandhan Bank.  LIC had earlier received the RBI go-ahead to buy 9.99 percent stake in HDFC Bank.  Banking sector outlook  Analysts as well as fund managers are bullish on financials, especially private sector banks, as they continue to gain market share while maintaining healthy asset quality.  Rating agency ICRA recently raised its projection of bank credit growth for FY24 to 14.9-15.3 percent from its earlier estimate of 12.8-13 percent.  For FY25, credit growth may temper to 11.7-12.6 percent, but it will still remain sizeable, ICRA said.  Also read: Moneycontrol Poll | Bankers, economists expect MPC to leave repo rate unchanged on Thursday  ICRA also expects the gross NPA (non performing assets) to decline to 2.1-2.5 percent and net-NPA to 0.5-0.6 percent by March 2025.  On back of this, Pramod Gubbi, co-founder of Marcellus Investment Managers believes private sector banks, despite the recent underperformance, present an intriguing opportunity. &quot;These stocks have relatively low valuations compared to other sectors that have seen significant growth,&quot; he said.  FII comeback to propel bank rally  When the Fed started hiking rates in 2022, foreign investors sold around $17 billion of Indian equities. This, combined with the influx of domestic money, took the overall FII stake in Indian markets to a decadal low.  Also read: Eye on elections: Will FIIs flock to India and front-end investments?  According to a recent report by ICICI Securities, FII stake in Indian markets fell to 16.5 percent as of November 2023, hitting its lowest since 2012, while it had peaked at 20.18 percent in 2009.  Financials, with a weightage of more than 33 percent in the Nifty 50, will be the first hunting ground for FPIs when they resume their purchases in Indian markets in a big way, believe analysts.

","Tax exemption on capital gains bonds is at a limit of Rs 50 lakh, and there has been a long-standing demand to extend that to Rs 1 crore. Suresh Ganapathy, Managing Director, Macquarie Capital, believes there is a possibility it will be addressed in the upcoming interim budget because real estate prices have gone up.  Ganapathy has been tracking the financial services sector for over two decades now. At the current juncture, he believes private sector banks are better placed than public sector banks. “Private sector banks are better in terms of digital banking, branch expansion, etc. Moreover, HDFC Bank is making life difficult for everybody in the system owing to merger-related needs,” he said.  Also Read: HDFC Bank faces tough task to deliver both on margins and costs: Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie  Edited excerpts:  What are your expectations for the banking sector from the interim budget? Or do you think it's going to be a non-event? I don’t expect too many announcements in this budget. There could possibly be further housing incentives or extensions of housing benefits from a taxation standpoint for the consumer. So at best, that is something I expect. Anyway, over the past few years, there has not been any capital allocation towards public sector banks because the health of the public sector banks has been pretty good. I think that trend will continue.  What are your expectations regarding housing incentives? Nothing major. However, the tax exemption on capital gains bonds is at a limit of Rs 50 lakh, and there has been a long-standing demand to extend that to Rs 1 crore. There is a possibility that it gets extended because real estate prices have gone up. Currently, the interest exemption on housing loans is Rs 2 lakh. That might also be partially increased. So, basic tinkering like that.  Also Read: 68% HNIs, 43% retail investors flip IPO trades in first week, says Sebi chair Madhabi Buch  A few weeks ago, a government document on the merger of four public sector banks was doing the rounds. Do you anticipate any announcements on that front? In the past, the government, may not directly but indirectly, has indicated that they would like to reduce the number of public sector banks and make them larger. Some of these PSU banks are still small, and therefore, merger is an inevitable option. It may not happen necessarily through a budget speech, but that's the medium-term goal of the government.  But why is that? If all the public sector banks have healthy asset quality now and no further capitalisation is needed from the government side… Where are the people to run these organisations? The existing management is getting old. There’s a musical chair taking place within the PSU banks. A’s ED (executive director) is moving to B. B’s ED is switching to A. That's a big challenge over a long time.  And from the RBI’s perspective, it is easier to manage a few large ones than multiple small ones.  Also Read: Sebi probing mule accounts, faulty IPO applications, 3 cases under scanner, says Buch  So, what's your pecking order now? Private sector banks over PSU banks, what do you prefer? We clearly prefer private sector banks over public sector banks. Look at the books over the past five years. PSU banks have lost market share and deposits — both CASA as well as term deposits. Anyway, they were losing market share on loans, and I think that will continue. The private sector banks are better in terms of digital banking, branch expansion, etc. Moreover, HDFC Bank is making life difficult for everybody in the system owing to merger-related needs. So, private sector banks will continue to grow faster than public sector banks.  Over the next six to 12 months, ECL (expected credit loss) guidelines will also come through, and private sector banks have better wherewithal to manage that compared to public sector banks.  And when the ECL guidelines kick in, will there be a sudden bump up in provisions for all banks? The RBI has given a five-year amortisation period for all the banks in the system once these ECL provisions are quantified. To that extent, there is time for banks to digest the impact. Private sector banks have contingent provisions that they can use to tide over this change and, thus, are in a better position. However, stock markets react differently. The moment it comes through, there could be a sharp reaction.  Also Read: Cycle of local players entering market almost over, says HUL's Rohit Jawa  Is there any investment case for old banks, like Karnataka Bank or Federal Bank? The thing about these old banks is that they are regionalised and localised. They are not pan-India. As long as they remain small and focus on their local markets, they have a basic level of strong customer franchise, and they keep getting those liabilities — all is good. They might not grow at 25-30 percent, but they can still grow around 14-15 percent and maintain profitability for the foreseeable future. They will never be in a position to topple the big private-sector banks.  But they should stay in the main domain areas where they have a better presence. For instance, City Union Bank in Tamil Nadu and Federal Bank in Kerala have a good catchment in terms of NRI customers. The niche is unlikely to be disrupted in a big way, and they can deliver moderate performance over the next four to five years.  Among private sector banks, what is your pecking order? We believe the best earnings growth will occur next year amongst the frontline top private sector banks. We expect around 15-20 percent earnings growth. So, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, and Axis Bank will be my top picks in the space.

","ICICI Bank Ltd. ended Axis Bank Ltd.’s 16-year reign as the largest arranger of rupee-denominated corporate bonds as sales climbed to a record last year.  India’s second-largest lender by market value managed 980.3 billion rupees ($11.8 billion) of offerings in 2023, including self-led transactions. That’s 17% of the total, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. HDFC Bank Ltd. stood second, with deals worth 797.4 billion rupees.  Axis Bank, which dominated the local-currency bond market from 2007 to 2022, came in third after arranging 763.5 billion rupees of transactions.  The lender “focused on higher fees business instead of just chasing volumes,” Neeraj Gambhir, group executive and head of treasury, markets and wholesale banking products at Axis, said in an interview.    Axis will stick to the same strategy this year and look to arrange more deals for AA to A rated issuers as well as private credit firms, Gambhir said. The lender will also focus on issuance from real estate investment trusts and InvITs as it expects them to become big borrowers in the bond market, he added.  ICICI Bank didn’t reply to an email seeking comments.  Businesses in the world’s fastest-growing major economy raised a record 10.4 trillion rupees selling bonds in 2023, and Gambhir expects issuance to increase by 15% this year as companies will likely take advantage of borrowing costs coming down if global central banks cut interest rates as expected.  Gambhir expects the new investment guidelines for banks that take effect in a few months to provide further impetus to the corporate bond market. India’s central bank in September allowed lenders to include company notes in their held-to-maturity book, and not be required to mark-to-market against yield movements.  “Apart from refinancing needs, we expect capital expenditure cycle to gain strength in the second half of the calendar year prompting firms to tap the bond market,” Gambhir said. Spreads between corporate and sovereign debt will remain tight as the supply of company notes is unlikely to exceed demand, he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/icici-bank-ends-axis-16-year-run-as-rupee-bond-market-king-12028601.html
icici,2024-01-05T09:49:40+05:30,Hiral Thanawala,"ICICI Bank reduces benefits on 21 credit cards, imposes minimum card usage for airport lounge access",The bank has also withdrawn rewards on rent payments and e-wallet loading while levying currency conversion mark-up on payments in INR at overseas destinations.,"ICICI Bank cardholders will soon see several changes in their credit card features and charges. These changes are introduced on selected 21 credit cards from ICICI Bank (see graphic).  This follows similar changes that credit cardholders at HDFC Bank, IDFC First Bank, SBI Card and a few others saw in 2023, especially when it came to curtailing airport lounge access within India. They had introduced minimum spending criteria on some of the credit cards to be eligible for airport lounge access.  Spending criteria on airport lounge access  Effective from April 1, ICICI Bank credit cardholders will get one complimentary airport lounge access by spending Rs 35,000 in the preceding calendar quarter. It means that spending made in the preceding calendar quarter will unlock access for the subsequent calendar quarter. For instance, to be eligible for complimentary lounge access in the April-June 2024 quarter, you need to spend a minimum of Rs 35,000 in the January-March 2024 quarter and similarly for the following quarters. At present, if you are using an ICICI Bank Coral Credit Card or ICICI Bank Expressions Credit Card you need a minimum spend of Rs 5,000 or above in a quarter to be eligible for complimentary lounge access.  This updated spending criterion to avail complimentary domestic airport lounge access will be applicable for below mentioned ICICI Bank credit cards:    “There are segments of cardholders who acquire lifetime free cards or mid-range cards and do not put any business on them, and then still use the airport lounge facilities offered by these cards,” said Ajay Awtaney, editor of LiveFromALounge.com, a popular website that provides information and analysis of credit cards and reward programs of hotels and airlines. So, for banks, these are loss-making customers.  Banks may not cancel the card for such customers just because they've not done business with them, but they reduce their costs (or benefits offered, if seen from the cardholder’s point of view), Awtaney added. So, the banks have changed product features to limit the number of lounge visits.  Also read | No passwords, PINs: How banking can be made simple and fraud-free for senior citizens  Dynamic currency conversion fee  Effective from February 1, a dynamic currency conversion (DCC) fee of 1 percent plus taxes will be applicable on each international transaction carried out in Indian currency at an international location or transactions carried out in Indian currency with merchants located in India but registered in a foreign nation. These charges will apply to all ICICI Bank credit cards.  DCC is the currency conversion service on a real-time basis. It allows cardholders to make credit card payments in Indian currency at international locations or to merchants located in India but registered in a foreign nation. Although DCC simplifies the understanding of prices in Indian currency, it involves additional mark-ups/charges levied by merchants that may be unfavourable for you.  For instance, when you make a purchase at a store in an international country and use your ICICI Bank credit card to pay in INR on a POS machine, a DCC mark-up fee of 1 percent, along with applicable taxes, will be applied to the transaction amount. Similarly, if you make a purchase in India from a merchant registered overseas and use your ICICI Bank credit card to pay in INR, a DCC mark-up fee of 1 percent, plus taxes, will be charged on the transaction amount. Earlier, ICICI Bank was not levying DCC mark-up fees on credit cards.  No reward points on rent payments and e-wallet loading  Effective from February 1, ICICI Bank will refuse reward points on rent payments and e-wallet loading using credit cards. This change will apply to all ICICI bank credit cards, except for Amazon Pay ICICI Bank credit cards.  “These days a common method of cashing out credit card limits is by paying fake rent to family members or friends through online platforms that enable such transactions without a formal rent agreement,” said Sumanta Mandal, founder, TechnoFino, a firm that tracks credit card trends. So, leading banks not only exclude rent from their reward-earning lists but also impose a surcharge on such payments, he added.  “While credit card devaluation (the reduction of benefits associated with a credit card over time) is an integral part of a credit card's lifecycle, such malpractices only accelerate the process,” Mandal said. Due to misuse by certain professional groups, genuine credit card users bear the brunt.

In her plea, Kochhar claimed the proper procedure was not followed while granting the sanction.  Kochhar and her husband Deepak were arrested by Central Bureau of Investigation on December 23, 2022 in the case. They were granted bail in January 2023 by HC, which pulled up the agency for arresting in a &quot;casual and mechanical&quot; manner and without application of mind. The Board of the ICICI Bank passed a resolution on April 22 granting sanction to prosecute Kochhar while accepting that there seemed to be a quid pro-quo. The CBI had informed the special court in June about the prosecution sanction given by the bank’s board.  Kochhar’s counsel Amit Desai on Monday submitted to a bench of Justices P D Naik and N R Borkar that the bank had not followed proper procedure while granting sanction. No loss was caused to the bank in the alleged case, he added. The CBI’s advocate, Kuldeep Patil, sought time to file an affidavit in response to the plea. The HC bench then posted the matter for further hearing on January 5. Apart from Chanda and Deepak Kochhars, the CBI had also arrested Videocon group founder Venugopal Dhoot in the case. He too was granted bail later.  As per the CBI, private sector lender ICICI Bank sanctioned credit facilities of Rs 3,250 crore to Videocon Group firms in violation of the Banking Regulation Act, Reserve Bank of India’s guidelines, and the credit policy of the bank. The CBI FIR was lodged in 2019 under Indian Penal Code sections related to criminal conspiracy and the Prevention of Corruption Act. The agency has claimed, as a part of quid pro quo, Dhoot made an investment of Rs 64 crore in Nupower Renewables through Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd (SEPL), and transferred SEPL to Pinnacle Energy Trust managed by Deepak Kochhar through a circuitous route between 2010 and 2012.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/chanda-kochhar-moves-hc-over-prosecution-sanction-by-icici-bank-board-11923151.html
icici,2023-12-12T13:20:53+05:30,Lovisha Darad,Analyst call tracker: ICICI Bank top pick in banking space; Kotak Mahindra least favourite,"Around 16 brokerages shared ‘hold’ call for Kotak Mahindra Bank in November, while ICICI Bank shares bagged 48 ‘buy’ calls, showed Moneycontrol’s analyst call tracker","Private sector lender ICICI Bank has emerged as Dalal Street’s top pick in the banking space amid steady July-September quarter (Q2FY24) results while Kotak Mahindra Bank saw maximum pessimism in November among analysts due to management overhaul, showed Moneycontrol’s analyst call tracker.  In November, about 16 brokerages shared a ‘hold’ call for Kotak Mahindra Bank, 5 shared a ‘sell’ call, and 23 shared ‘buy’ ratings. On the other hand, ICICI Bank has 48 ‘buy’ calls, 3 ‘hold’ calls, and no ‘sell’ rating. Overall, the optimism rate stood at 94.12 percent in November, data showed.  Analysts at Emkay Global, for instance, trimmed target price multiple for Kotak Mahindra Bank to 2.6x Sep-25E ABV from 2.8x Jun-25E ABV, factoring in management transition-related risks. “Kotak Mahindra Bank’s new MD &amp;amp; CEO, Ashok Vashwani has the tall task of managing senior management attrition or business dislocation and filling the larger shoes of ex-CEO Uday Kotak,” the brokerage firm said, sharing a ‘hold’ rating on the counter, with a target price of Rs 1,955 per share (current market price: Rs 1,843)    ALSO READ: Ravi Dharamshi bullish on renewables, banks, but stays cautious on pharma  Meanwhile, analysts at JM Financial believe that ICICI Bank firmly remains on the path to deliver 2.2 percent/18 percent average RoA/RoE over FY24-25E with stable asset quality and continued growth momentum. Moreover, they expect favourable growth and good execution to benefit ICICI Bank. The brokerage firm had shared a ‘buy’ rating on the counter, with a target price of Rs 1,155 per share (CMP: Rs 1,017)    ICICI Bank shares have gained 8 percent in a month, whereas Kotak Mahindra Bank surged 5 percent. In comparison, the Bank Nifty climbed 8 percent.  How have ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank fared in Q2FY24?  ICICI Bank clocked 35.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in standalone profit at Rs 10,261 crore in Q2FY24, while net interest income (NII) jumped 24 percent YoY as bad loan provisions saw a significant drop.  However, analysts warned that margin contraction could be a pain point for the lender going ahead as deposit repricing plays out. Going ahead, the management expects the cost of funds to rise for another quarter but sees full-year net interest margin (NIM) for FY24E to be stable versus FY23.  Except for the NIM disappointment, other parameters remain intact for the bank, whether deposit growth or asset quality. Gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) declined by 28 basis points (bps) YoY in Q2FY24 while advances grew 18 percent YoY.  ALSO READ: Bank Nifty hits record high of 47,303, clocks biggest weekly gain since July 2022  As for Kotak Mahindra Bank, the lender saw a 24 percent YoY increase in the second quarter standalone net profit, whereas NII rose 23 percent YoY.  Deposit growth, too, was strong at 23 percent YoY but CASA slipped to 48 percent from the high range of 50s and thus weighed on cost of funds. NIMs contracted by 35 bps sequentially mainly due to higher cost of funds.  Going forward, analysts believe that margins for Kotak Mahindra Bank could be under pressure as the cost of funds stays in catch-up mode as do peers. Kotak Bank’s slippages were higher than expected for the second quarter in a row due to the grossing up of NPAs during the quarter, said analysts at Emkay Global.  ICICI Bank’s RoE best in class versus peers  Analysts at CLSA noted that ICICI Bank’s return on equity (RoE) is best in class versus its peer group. The brokerage firm shared a ‘buy’ rating for the lender, with a target price of Rs 1,225 apiece.  “ICICI Bank’s return on assets (RoA) of 2.2 percent and RoE of 18 percent are best in class in its peer group. Given the stock’s muted returns over the past year, the stock trades at a reasonable price-to-earnings (PE) ratio or price-to-book (PB) ratio. We adjust PE/PB ratio at 13 times (x)/2.1x for FY25E,” it said in a note post Q2 earnings.  Besides that, Phillip Capital analysts expect continued improvement in the return on risk-weighted assets for the bank, which is the highest in the industry. “We expect earnings growth of over 15.4 percent/13.6 percent in FY24E/25E translating into RoA of 2 percent,” the brokerage firm said, maintaining a ‘buy’ rating on the counter, with a target price of Rs 1,140.  Kotak Bank’s management overhaul raises investor scepticism  In a surprising move, the RBI cleared the appointment of Ashok Vaswani as the MD &amp;amp; CEO of Kotak Bank, effective January 1, 2024, for three years, superseding the internal candidates (EDs). It is unclear if Vaswani was the bank’s preferred recommendation or if his appointment is an unanticipated RBI decision.  Notably, Vaswani has a long and rich work experience in the consumer, corporate and digital banking arenas, given his long stint with global banks like Citigroup and Barclays as well as his recent leadership role in a US-Israeli AI firm.

The apex court upheld the division bench's decision to reject Kochhar's interim application for post-retirement benefits from ICICI Bank. Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing Kochhar, argued that the Bombay High Court's ruling was unjust, stating that the bank initially offered retirement benefits to Kochhar but later revoked the offer.  The court, however, refused to entertain the plea.  In May 2023, a division bench of the Bombay High Court upheld the order of a single judge rejecting her interim application seeking post retirement benefits from ICICI bank. The division bench held that granting any relief to Kochhar would cause irreparable prejudice to ICICI Bank, and noted that if the bank succeed in its suit it  would then be required to seek recovery of the shares acquired by Kochhar.  On November 10 2022, the Bombay High Court said the termination of Kochhar from the post of CEO of ICICI Bank was prima facie a “valid termination” and dismissed her interim application seeking post-retirement benefits. The bench also directed Kochhar to not deal with the bank's 6.90 lakh shares she had acquired in 2018. She was also told to disclose in an affidavit all dealings with respect to the shares within six weeks.  Genesis of the case:  In May 2018, ICICI Bank initiated an inquiry against its former CEO and MD Chanda Kochhar. Soon, she went on leave and later applied for an early retirement, which was accepted. The bank then said it had treated her separation as 'Termination for Cause' and had also sought approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for ending her appointment as was mandatory under the provisions of the RBI Act.  In its chargesheet filed in January, 2019, the CBI had said that ICICI Bank, under Kochhar, sanctioned loans to Videocon in violation of the credit policies of the bank. These loans later turned non-performing assets (NPAs) resulting in wrongful loss to the bank and wrongful gain to the borrower and the accused. Thus the  The ICICI Bank-Videocon case is one of the most high-profile scams witnessed  by the Indian banking industry. This marked the downfall of Kochhar, who started as a junior officer in the bank , and later rose through the ranks to head the company.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/legal/sc-refuses-to-entertain-chanda-kochhars-plea-against-icici-bank-on-retirement-benefits-11874681.html

HDFC Bank, beyond doubt, Samir Arora's all-time favourite. The fund, which comes from Arora-founded Helios house, has come up with its first monthly factsheet that shows HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and State Bank of India as its top three picks.  The celebrated fund manager made a comeback in India's mutual fund scene last month, but this time as a sponsor, and all eyes are on his hotlist. The three banks make for 18.8 percent of the total assets under management. HDFC Bank alone has a 8.9 percent weight in the AUM, despite the stock's underperformance over the past one year.  Arora acknowledges this underperformance.

However, he believes the stock's underperformance can reverse in the next one year and it can beat the benchmark.    Other holdings  The fund has allocated 3 percent each to Zomato and HPCL.

Called Elimination Investing, Helios’ unique EI framework involves weeding out the bad as the first step. “It is easier to know what is bad than what is good. Rejecting bad companies increases the chances of arriving at the good companies, reduces errors, and reduces the cost of errors,” as per the fund house.  The fund house looks at various factors for permanent rejection and temporary rejection. Permanent factors include ‘Limited Size of Opportunity’, ‘Unfavourable Industry Dynamics’, ‘Potential for Disruption’, ‘Low Quality of Accounting’, ‘Weakness in Management/Background/Strategy’, ‘Poor Corporate Governance’ and ‘Low Quality Governance’.  Temporary factors include ‘Negative Medium-term Triggers’ and ‘Unreasonably High Valuations’. The team further classifies a company as good and bad on each of these factors.

icici,2023-12-05T09:56:57+05:30,Abhishek Mukherjee,"Analyst Call Tracker: Banking, infra stocks rule the roost; no respite for IT pack","Banking, finance and select infrastructure stocks featured prominently on analysts’ wish lists in November, while IT companies continued to be at the receiving end of brokerages’ sell calls.","Banking, finance and select infrastructure stocks featured prominently on analysts’ wish lists in November as sustained business growth, improvement in asset quality and a strong capex cycle boosted their investment appeal.  IT companies, meanwhile, continued to be at the receiving end of brokerages’ sell calls, as per Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for November.  Macroeconomic challenges in the US and Europe – the bread-and-butter markets for the domestic software services industry – has dampened the outlook for the entire IT pack, though there are some notable exceptions in the mid-cap space.  But for investors looking to position themselves in relatively ‘safe’ spaces, analysts recommend loading up on frontline banking and infra names.    Street Favourites  Banking and financial sector stocks dominate the optimism list for the month of November, maintaining their momentum post robust Q2 results.  “Banks reported healthy credit growth and improved asset quality but faced net interest margin (NIM) compression on the back of rising funding cost. Term deposits growth was encouraging but CASA remained sluggish. Retail and MSME (loans) grew strongly,” HDFC Securities said.  However, the sector faced an unexpected googly last month after the RBI increased the risk weights on unsecured consumer loans, including credit cards, by 25 percent for both banks and NBFCs.  That said, analysts reckon NBFCs will see a higher impact on growth and profitability versus other financial institutions as they have seen sharpest increase in exposure to unsecured retail lending.  This was reflected in analysts’ ‘buy’ recommendations as well, with banks handily beating their non-banking counterparts.  Analysts’ tracker: Coal India sees most upgrades in a month among Nifty names  SBI Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara, in an interaction with brokerage firm Motilal Oswal, exuded confidence that RBI’s move will not pose any significant challenge for the bank.  “The overall impact is estimated to be 49 bps – of which 28bps is attributed to unsecured loans and 21bp is due to lending to NBFCs... The bank believes that it is well placed to absorb this impact, as its full year profit will keep CET-1 in the comfortable zone,” Motilal Oswal said in a note.  The bank’s Common Equity Tier-1 (CET-1) ratio, including 1H profits, stands at 11.03 percent, and after this impact, it will still be fairly comfortable at 10.54 percent while the underlying profitability remains strong and will enable sustained growth momentum, it added.  On the unsecured loan book (Xpress credit), while growth has already moderated to 18 percent YoY from 25 percent earlier, SBI said its Xpress credit portfolio has robust underwriting as 96 percent of salaried customers are government employees.  Hot Picks  ICICI Bank retained its tag as the company with the most ‘buy’ calls at 48, followed by SBI (47) and IndusInd Bank (45).  ICICI Bank hogged the limelight during the September-quarter earnings season after posting a 35.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in standalone profit at Rs 10,261 crore, beating estimates.  The company’s net interest income (NII) jumped 24 percent YoY to Rs 18,308 crore as bad loan provisions saw a significant drop.  “ICICI Bank delivered a superior performance in Q2FY24, and we expect a robust growth momentum in advances and deposits, particularly during the upcoming festive season. Diversified loan portfolio, healthy asset quality, digital capabilities, and sufficient capitalisation augur well for the company’s future performance,” Geojit BNP Paribas said in a recent note.  The other sector in focus was infrastructure, with NTPC, Adani Ports and Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro seeing a flurry of ‘buy’ ratings.  “This (infrastructure and engineering) space has been performing very well driven by capex activity, especially from the government side. Spaces like capital goods, infrastructure, engineering have posted strong performance. Margins too for these businesses have been higher, especially since pre-Covid numbers,” ASK Investment Managers noted.  The upcoming elections may moderate capex order inflows, but the long-term outlook for capex remains positive, with significant opportunities in various sectors like metros, railways, tunnels, airports, mining, and the Jal Jeevan Mission, it added.  Morgan Stanley’s Ridham Desai on what will drive 20% earnings growth over the next four years   However, it is Hindalco which tops the list of companies with the most optimism –defined as the percentage share of &quot;buy&quot; calls in analyst recommendations in total – despite a lackluster Q2 show.  The Aditya Birla Group flagship reported flat consolidated net profit for Q2 FY24 at Rs 2,196 crore, while revenue from operations fell 3.6 percent on-year to Rs 54,169 crore, it said on November 10.  However, analysts believe Hindalco is an attractive bet in the metals sector due to tailwinds like drop in input costs (thermal coal prices), focus on high-margin value-added products and gradual improvement in per ton EBITDA of its US subsidiary Novelis.  Tech Talk  The IT sector accounts for half of the companies on the pessimism list – a trend largely unchanged from the beginning of this year.    IT services companies reported weak performance in Q2FY24, with a median revenue growth of just 1 percent QoQ (in constant currency terms).  High interest rates and negative consumer sentiment in the US and Europe – the biggest markets for domestic software firms – has made 2023 a year to forget for India’s IT majors.  What’s more, analysts do not expect a reversal in fortunes anytime soon.  “An analysis of the commentary of leading global enterprises across verticals does not inspire confidence in a quick rebound in discretionary spending. Cost reduction is front and center for a large number of enterprises across sectors, with cost savings targets that extend well into CY2024,” Kotak Institutional Equities said.  However, it added that the intent to invest in tech remains, with a focus on digitalization, automation, back-end systems and AI initiatives, and catch-up is possible once the macroeconomic situation improves.  “An uptick in deal conversions in 1H CY24 is required to provide a better safety net on FY2025 growth projections,” it further said.  Divi’s Laboratories maintained its position as the stock with the highest percentage of sell/hold calls.  The pharma firm on November 6 reported a 29.50 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in its consolidated net profit to Rs 348 crore for the July-September quarter, as tailwinds from the COVID-19 drug Molnupiravir faded in the current financial year.  Revenue came in at Rs 1,909 crore, up merely 3 percent from the year-ago figure of Rs 1,855 crore.  Aside from an unfavourable base, analysts had also anticipated softening of overall active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) prices to weigh on the company's results.  “…heightened competition in the API segment poses risk. We believe the company’s earnings may have limited upside potential and margin may remain under pressure in the near future,” analysts at Geojit said.

HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are his top picks","Bulls pushed Nifty Bank index to fresh record highs on December 4 amid a rally fuelled by BJP's state election wins. The banking index surged over 1,600 points or 3 percent to hit a fresh high of 46,484, clocking its biggest single-day gain since April 2022. It settled at 46,431. The sharp rally has pushed Bank Nifty's year-to-date gains to 7 percent, trimming its underperformance vis-a-vis NSE Nifty50.  Andrew Holland, CEO of Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies LLP believes that the banking sector is set for recovery.  Bank Nifty index fell to 42,280 on October 26. Since then, the index has bounced back 4,000 points. HDFC Bank has been the biggest contributor to the Nifty Bank's recovery, contributing over 900 points, or 7 percent to this rally. ICICI Bank also rose 7 percent during this period.  Going forward, a rise in foreign investor inflows, a decline in US bond yields, and the optimistic anticipation of no further rate hikes will fuel gains for Indian equities.

Andrew Holland's top bets  Within the sector, Andrew Holland prefers private sector lenders more than PSU banks as the management of public sector banks keeps changing every three years. HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are Holland's top picks among the private sector banks.  Banks have attractive valuations and are backed with clean and healthy balance sheets, strong asset quality, and are witnessing robust credit growth, according to analysts. The financial space looks very compelling on a risk-reward basis as these stocks have not participated meaningfully in the last year and a half, they said.

However, after meeting this zone on the higher side, the market may see some profit-taking and consolidation before getting into the mood for another leg of rally, according to the experts.  The BJP victory in three states out of four that declared results on December 3 increased hopes for policy and reforms continuation at the Centre after the general elections next year, and ended the uncertainty related to elections and further boosted the confidence among market participants in addition to already getting positive vibes on the global front.  Read | BJP’s election sweep calms populism fears, allays market concerns about political risks  For the week ended December 1, the Nifty50 jumped 2.4 percent, the biggest weekly gains since June this year, to end at fresh record closing high of 20,268 and formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly charts. The index continued uptrend for fifth consecutive session with good volumes and moved into uncharted territory.  &quot;The support zone has seen a strong upliftment starting from 20,150-20,100, followed by 20,000-19,950 for the current week. While on the higher end, amid favourable conditions, the Nifty seems potent to test 20,400 - 20,500 in the comparable period,&quot; Osho Krishan, senior analyst - technical and derivative research at Angel One, said.  Pravesh Gour, senior technical analyst at Swastika Investmart also believes the Nifty effortlessly surpassing previous record high is an indication of a continuation of this momentum where 20,500 looks like an immediate target. On the downside, &quot;20,125-20,000 is an immediate support zone, and 19,800–19,600 are key support levels at any pullback&quot;, he said.  Hence, going forward, experts expect any dips to augur well for the bulls. Also, &quot;along with the heavyweights, the mid and small-cap counters are keeping up the buzz and may continue to do so,&quot; Osho said.

Breaking above the downward sloping trendline and closing above the two-month high on Friday are positive signals.  The supportive volumes further suggest a potential end to the correction phase, paving the way for an impulse move towards Rs 2,180-2,200 levels. Investors may want to keep an eye on this stock for potential trading opportunities.    Tata Power: Buy | LTP: Rs 276 | Stop-Loss: Rs 262 | Target: Rs 306 | Return: 11 percent  The stock has been undergoing an extended phase of time correction since October 2021, with prices ranging between Rs 275 and Rs 200. The formation of a Cup and Handle Pattern, accompanied by strong rising price bars and high-volume activity, suggests a potential breakout.  If the stock manages to break above Rs 277-278 levels, it could mark the beginning of the next bullish impulse for this stock. Investors may want to monitor this breakout for potential trading opportunities.  ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,457 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,380 | Target: Rs 1,625 | Return: 11 percent  The stock has not been an impressive performer since the corrective move that occurred in late 2021. However, it has been in a phase of time correction since April 2023, finding support at Rs 1,080-1,100 levels. The recent impressive range expansion on the bullish side, combined with a multi-month bullish breakout, suggests a shift in sentiment.  The volume participation during this breakout indicates the potential end of the time correction and the beginning of a new bullish price impulse for the stock.  Expert: Vinay Rajani, senior technical and derivative analyst at HDFC Securities  NOCIL: Buy | LTP: Rs 246 | Stop-Loss: Rs 228.8 | Target: Rs 270-290 | Return: 18 percent  The stock price has formed bullish Inverted Head and Shoulder pattern on the daily chart and on the verge of breaking out from the neckline. On December 1, 2023, the stock surged more than 6 percent with jump in volumes.  The stock recently found support on 50 DEMA and bounced back. It is holding above its 20, 50, 100 and 200 DEMA (exponential moving average), which indicates bullish trend on all time frame. Indicators and Oscillators like DMI (directional movement index) and RSI (relative strength index) have turned bullish on the daily charts.    GSFC: Buy | LTP: Rs 193.7 | Stop-Loss: Rs 179 | Target: Rs 214-235 | Return: 21 percent  Gujarat State Fertilizers &amp;amp; Chemicals stock has broken out from bullish “Flag” pattern on the weekly chart.

Indicators and oscillators like DMI and RSI have turned bullish on the daily charts. PSU Bank Index has resumed its primary uptrend after small consolidation.  Expert: Mehul Kothari, DVP – Technical Research at Anand Rathi  ICICI Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 946.7 | Stop-Loss: Rs 899 | Target: Rs 1,001-1,022 | Return: 8 percent  We are bullish on Nifty Bank index for the coming few weeks and ICICI Bank is a major part of the index. The peers of ICICI Bank like Axis Bank and IndusInd Bank underwent a decent rally in the past few sessions, and we expect the same in ICICI Bank.  As of now, the stock has confirmed a falling trendline breakout just above the placement of 200 DEMA.  Thus, traders are advised to buy ICICI Bank in the range of Rs 945 - 935 with a stop-loss of Rs 899 on closing basis for an upside target of Rs 1,001 and Rs 1,022 in coming 1 – 2 months.  Rolex Rings: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,451 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,300 | Target: Rs 2,700 | Return: 10 percent  Rolex Rings has been consolidating in a broad range since quite some time and in Friday’s session it has confirmed a breakout from that band.  The price action is supported with decent volumes and also the daily ADX (average directional index) is about to come out of 20 level and that indicates strength.  Thus, traders are advised to buy Rolex Rings near Rs 2,450 with a stop-loss of Rs 2,300 on closing basis for an upside target of Rs 2,700 in coming 1 – 2 months.  ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 450 | Stop-Loss: Rs 434 | Target: Rs 470 | Return: 4.4 percent  After almost 5 months of rangebound activity we have witnessed a considerable move in ITC and that too on the upside.  The stock is already in a strong up trend on the long term scale and has now confirmed a fresh breakout. This indicates that the TIGER is awake.  Thus, traders are advised to buy ITC near Rs 446 with a stop-loss of Rs 434 on closing basis for an upside target of Rs 470 in coming 1 – 2 months.    Expert: Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio  Max Healthcare Institute: Buy | LTP: Rs 652 | Stop-Loss: Rs 620 | Target: Rs 700 | Return: 7 percent  Max Healthcare has seen breaking out of a bullish pattern on the weekly timeframe with a bullish candlestick and above average volume which indicates strength as the stock is also trading above all its important EMAs on the daily timeframe which acts as a confluence.  The Supertrend indicator is also indicating a bullish continuation which supports the bullish view. Momentum oscillator RSI (14) is at around 71 on the daily time frame indicating strength by sustaining above 50. And the Ichimoku cloud is also suggesting a bullish move as the price is trading above the conversion line, base line and cloud.  Observation of the above factors indicates that a bullish move in Max Healthcare is possible for target upto Rs 700. One can initiate a buy trade in between the range of Rs 650-652, with a stop-loss of Rs 620 on daily closing basis.

At the click of a button, you can view bank balances, top spending and income categories, expense breakdowns, daily inflows, expenses, and balance analysis.","Most depositors have multiple bank accounts, and it has always been difficult for customers to visit different bank branches or navigate through different banking apps to track the balances and spends from these accounts.  To simplify managing finances for customers, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank have launched single-view dashboards, which display account information across bank accounts, on their mobile apps and internet banking platforms. Axis Bank's single-view dashboard is named one-view, while that of ICICI Bank is called iFinance.  So, how does one bank get access to information about other bank accounts maintained by the account holder? This is possible thanks to the account aggregator ecosystem.  “This feature offers a seamless banking experience and provides convenience to customers by eliminating the need for multiple mobile banking applications,” said Sameer Shetty, President &amp;amp; Head – Digital Business &amp;amp; Transformation, Axis Bank.  This will ensure an easy, quick snapshot of all their bank transactions at the click of a button.  Sidharatha Mishra, Head - Digital Channels, ICICI Bank, said, “With iFinance, we are enabling our customers as well as customers of other banks to view their account data in one place and provide them with better control over their finances.”  How it works  Existing customers of ICICI Bank have access to iFinance through its Internet banking portal and mobile applications. To initiate the process, log in to your ICICI Bank net banking or mobile application. Choose iFinance and do a mobile OTP verification. The OTP is sent by Setu, a Reserve Bank of India-regulated account aggregator.  Then choose the bank accounts you want to link. Verify the accounts via OTP and track your bank accounts using the iFinance feature.  To link your accounts on Axis Bank’s mobile application with the one-view feature, the process remains the same. Here, the OTP for mobile verification is sent by Finvu, another RBI-regulated account aggregator.  The banks’ customers do not have to pay a fee to use the account aggregator-enabled features.

icici,2023-11-18T07:03:31+05:30,Dhananjay Sinha,Will the rally in small PSU bank shares sustain?,"Expert expects to see derating in smaller PSBs as the surge in other income, the primary driver of superior RoE (return on equity) in FY23 could be transient.","The heavyweight Bank Nifty index has been languishing since the last two years, inching up merely 3 percent. But, among its constituents, stock prices of large banks and small public sector lenders have shown contrasting performance. To gauge if the outperformance of smaller PSBs versus large banks (PSBs and PVBs - private banks) can sustain, we looked at measures such as returns, operating performance, credit cycle, NPA movement, and provisioning trajectory.  In conclusion, we expect to see derating in smaller PSBs as the surge in other income, the primary driver of superior RoE (return on equity) in FY23 could be transient, while larger banks with better ALM (asset and liability management) positions and underwriting capabilities would outperform.  A peek into the business performance: One, business market shares (deposits + advances) of smaller PSBs declined in FY23 relative to both SBI and larger PVBs, but recovery of written-off loans drove up return ratios of PSBs. Two, large private banks sustained gains in business share (advances &amp;amp; deposits), credit cycle, and better underwriting track record in FY23. RoEs of PSBs rose significantly in FY23 (12 percentage points (pp) and 16.5pp for SBI &amp;amp; BoB, respectively) compared to those of PVBs (ICICI Bank up 4.7pp, HDFC Bank 0.08pp, Axis Bank -0.97pp and Kotak Mahindra Bank 1.38pp).  Also read: Opportunity in market correction: MFs added these new midcaps in Oct  Markets seem to have reacted differently: Shares of smaller PSBs nearly doubled and valuations surged by 50-60 percent, especially in the last 8-12 months. Amongst all PSBs, Bank of Baroda’s valuations benefitted the most from declining NPAs (correlation coefficient: -0.91). For instance, its business market share/total PSU share fell from 12.52 in FY20 to 10.26 in FY23, but P/B (price-to-book) more than doubled from 0.5x in December 2021 to peak level of 1.1 in December 2022.  Conversely, valuations of PVBs moderated during this period, even though PVBs (increased 0.6pp) scored over PSBs (average of 0.40pp) on NIMs, reflecting relatively better credit cycle. Major banks (SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Axis Bank) saw de-rating during this period, in contrast to the re-rating seen in smaller PSU banks (PSBs). For instance, largecap like State Bank of India (SBI) underperformed and remained stagnant since October 2021; its P/B de-rated from a peak of 1.8x in November 2021 (trailing) to 1.5x currently. Likewise, large private banks too saw muted valuations.  Also read: Bajaj Finance in double trouble from RBI’s risk-weight norms, product ban  Will the dichotomy sustain? We gather, the valuation differential for smaller PSBs does not appear to be guided by fundamentals of business cycle and market power hypothesis. Rather, the rerating of smaller PSBs appears to be guided by RoE gains. The recovery from written-off loans classified under advance under collection account (AUCA; attributed to the past NPA cycle) was substantial for smaller PSBs in FY23 at 100-200 percent YoY, which contributed disproportionately to its net profits and hence, these banks delivered superior RoEs, notwithstanding their modest NIMs and pre-provisioning profits.  Given that these are legacy factors, they are expected to decline going forward. Small PSBs have risen to peak levels recently but the recent sell offs in small PSU banks appear to be blunting the re-rating momentum in the space in last 8-12 months.  Also read: UBS says India ‘least attractive’, analysts warn of election and oil price risks  Smaller PSBs at peak valuations: Based on our study, we gather, holding pattern of PSBs (dominated by concentrated bets by certain FIIs) and fundamental factors such as recovery of written-off loans have caused return ratios and valuations of smaller PSBs to shore up. Further, a quarterly series of stock ownership, NPA ratios, yields on advanced, and cost of deposits indicate low contemporaneous correlation between valuations and spreads variables (yields, cost of deposits). There exists an inverse correlation between GNPA (gross non-performing assets) ratios and valuations, especially for Indian Bank (-0.82) and BoB (-0.91); SBI is at -0.54, but for other PSBs, it is less consistent.  Changes in shareholding patterns appear to have influenced the valuations of smaller PSBs. We envisage valuations of smaller PSBs could derate from the current level, as surge in other income, the primary driver of superior RoE for smaller PSBs could be transient, given that it comes from recovery of written-off bad loans. For SBI, it peaked out in FY21 and was down 25 percent in FY23 at Rs 7,692 crore.  Also read: Ola Electric converts to public company ahead of IPO filing  Larger banks may outperform: Evolving cyclical factors like sustained tightness in global rates, FII outflows, rising yield curve translating in trading losses, continued pressure on NIMs, and bottoming out of the NPA cycle would determine the performance of lenders, including banks and NBFCs. In this context, we believe larger banks with better ALM positions and underwriting capabilities will outperform. Overall, we maintain our underweight position for the BFSI sector.

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)| Target Price Rs 12,000| India's biggest car manufacturer's extensive product portfolio covers a wide range of price segments with six battery electric vehicles planned for release by the end of FY23. The recent successful launches have also helped the SUV class to reach a market share of 23.3 percent.

Celebrated fund manager and chief investment officer of ICICI Prudential AMC S Naren feels that there is need to be very selective with banks, be it private or public sector.  Even as some of the ICICI Prudential's leading equity funds are overweight on quality banks like HDFC Bank, Naren told Moneycontrol that quality banks will not be able to reclaim the high valuations they enjoyed earlier as their large base will not allow them to maintain the growth rates of the past without taking on additional risk.  Private sector banking stocks have been underperforming for a year now. HDFC Bank is down 1 percent, Kotak Mahindra Bank is down 7 percent, ICICI Bank is up 4 percent, while Nifty 50 is up 6.8 percent in the year gone by.  Also Read: Why ace investor Shankar Sharma doesn’t invest in large cap stocks: 'Size ceiling limits growth'  “I doubt whether they (quality banks) can go back to the valuations that they were enjoying 10 years ago, simply because many of them are much larger today.” As these banks are much larger than they were 10 years ago, it is hard to justify the high price-to-book multiple they enjoyed in the past, Naren said.  “When you're small, you can have very high price-to-book because they can they can grow at very high pace. Some of these banks were growing at 30-40 percent. It would be almost impossible to do that kind of growth going ahead.” said Naren.  He said quality banks are firmly on a secular growth story in India, which makes a case for investing in them. However, their valuations of the past may not serve as good benchmark. “Can their price to book keep going up? The answer is no. That's the challenge in some of the private banks which have now become very big.” Naren added.  Watch S Naren's full interview on Samvat 2080  As for public-sector banks, he said, across-the-board stocks have seen significant re-rating and are thus expensive. Public-sector banks will have to be evaluated individually for whether they will continue to maintain their asset-quality or fall prey to bad assets yet again.  So again, time to be selective because “There was a superb way in which they brought down their non performing loans. Due to that, they got rerated. From here, you have to look at them individually and see what happens to their net interest margin, and can they continue to maintain the very low level of non-performing loans. Some banks that declared results recently have been able to manage with almost no provisioning because the book is so pristine. Can it remain like this way, even in private sector, it won't,” said Naren.  Picking stocks when they are very cheap is easier, however, in the current markets as stocks have been re-rated substantially, it poses a challenge, he concluded.

In contrast, ICICI Bank topped the list of the most sought-after stocks, with the maximum number of &quot;buy&quot; calls, as per Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for October.    Team Optimism  Hindalco tops the list of companies with the most optimism, which is based on the percentage share of &quot;buy&quot; calls in analyst recommendations in total.  Analysts believe Hindalco is well-placed in the metals space due a number of factors such as a drop in thermal coal prices and opening of captive mines, rising focus on high-margin value-added products and gradual improvement in per ton EBITDA of its subsidiary, Novelis, led by resilient developed economies and gradual improvement in consumer demand from China.  Also read: Analyst Call Tracker: Strong Q2 performance by RIL leads analysts to upgrade outlook  But it was ICICI Bank that emerged as the company with the most number of &quot;buy&quot; calls, getting the better of previous month’s winner SBI.  India’s second-largest private sector lender clocked a 35.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in standalone profit at Rs 10,261 crore in Q2 FY24, beating estimates. The company’s net interest income (NII) jumped 24 percent YoY to Rs 18,308 crore as bad loan provisions saw a significant drop.  “ICICI Bank has been demonstrating reasonable consistency in sustaining growth leadership across segments, especially in unsecured loans, which has witnessed growth in excess of 35% for six straight quarters, while simultaneously managing a superior asset quality.  “Coupled with incremental investments around digital and physical channels, we are confident of the bank’s ability to drive productivity and efficiency gains on its way to deliver and sustain RoAs in excess of 2%,” analysts at HDFC Securities said.  Compare this to the sentiment surrounding HDFC Bank, which features in the list of firms to see the most downgrades over the past quarter as well as over the previous month.    HDFC Bank, which reported its first quarterly results after it merged with the parent Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), posted a net profit of Rs 15,976.11 crore in the July-September period, with an NII of Rs 27,385 crore.  While the Q2 numbers are not comparable to the pre-merger period, HDFC Bank’s management provided proforma numbers for the first quarter to give a sense of how the merged entity would look.  As per an analysis by Jefferies, adjusted for the merger, HDFC Bank’s net profit declined 2 percent sequentially against the reported 33 percent jump.  More worryingly, its net interest margin (NIM) tumbled 70 basis points sequentially to 3.4 percent against the 4 percent-level HDFC Bank has traditionally maintained.  One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. NIM, the difference between what banks offer depositors and what they charge for loans, is a key profitability metric for lenders.  “Once a poster boy for consistency, HDFC Bank has seen it all COVID-19 (concerns on unsecured), management transition, the RBI ban and now merger pangs,” Elara Capital has said. HDFC Bank is facing concerns regarding deserving a premium, post the merger (challenged differentiation unlike earlier cycles). &quot;While merger has its own challenges, we believe these are nearing an end, but HDFC Bank lacks positive triggers. Given near-term concerns, time correction may play through,&quot; it added.  Ctrl-Alt-Delete  One look at the pessimism list and it is clear which sector has the most naysayers at the moment. Six out of the total 10 firms belong to the IT industry.    Elevated interest rates and weak consumer sentiment in Western economies, their biggest markets, have continued to slow down discretionary spends, leading to delays in decision-making as well as deal conversions for domestic software services firms.  TCS, the country’s biggest IT company, posted a sequential decline in dollar revenue for the first time since the pandemic-marred June 2020 quarter.  The bigger shock was Infosys slashing its FY24 revenue growth guidance for the second straight quarter to 1-2.5 percent from 1–3.5 percent.  &quot;We continue to believe that Infosys is going through some company-specific issues, exacerbated by weak macros. We, hence, expect Infosys to underperform peers in the near to medium term,&quot; said Nuvama Institutional Equities.

The Bengaluru-based IT major saw its revenue decline for the third consecutive quarter, coming in at $2.7 billion for the July-September period, a fall of 2.3 percent sequentially.  The decline was primarily due to the continued weakness in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) vertical as well as the company's high exposure to consulting at a time when discretionary spending has plummeted.  Wipro had the weakest growth among its large-cap peers.  Not just that, for the upcoming quarter, the company expects a revenue decline in the 3.5 percent to 1.5 percent range.  “The near-term demand environment remains challenging as the clients remain cautious regarding the evolving macroeconomic situation, especially in the US and Europe; and consequently, we expect muted revenue performance in the near term,” analysts at Yes Securities said.  More than a bite  Another industry titan which found itself at the receiving end of downgrades was Hindustan Unilever.  India’s largest FMCG firm, considered a proxy for the broader consumer trends in the country, raised a huge red flag at the start of the earnings season after it reported an anaemic volume growth of 2 percent.

But beyond these near-term challenges, analysts have flagged HUL’s lacklustre show in the recent past. HUL has been a five-year market laggard now, in part due to unwinding of a significant past re-rating phase, HSBC said in a note.  But is there a case for a rebound?  “We see this as less likely and believe stock returns will likely remain lacklustre. Hence, we downgrade the stock to Hold. Upside risk to this view is that HUL’s defensive appeal rises if market becomes extremely risk averse,” HSBC added.

icici,2023-10-30T08:21:33+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Market crash: This research head shares his top picks with strong earnings momentum,"Profitmart Securities' Avinash Gorakshakar recommends investors buy Anant Raj, ICICI Bank, and M&amp;M during this market fall.","The domestic benchmarks and broader markets have been under significant pressure as FIIs continue their unabated sell-off, bond yields spike, and the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East continue to mount. While on October 27 the frontline indices saw some recovery, gaining over one percent in trade, the indices are lower by more than six percent from the all-time highs clocked in mid-September.  Therefore, does this market downturn signal an opportunity for the smart investor to accumulate high-quality counters at attractive valuations?  In a conversation with Moneycontrol, Avinash Gorakshakar, head of research at Profitmart Securities, shares his recommendations on counters that have growth potential over the next 12-15 months.  Anant Raj | CMP: Rs 240 | TP: Rs Rs 303  Anant Raj’s land bank is well-located and is primarily based in NCR. We expect growth in sales led by: i) growth in overall sales in NCR, ii) lower inventory levels in NCR (12 months), iii) attractively located land bank (175 out of the 240 acres located in Sector 63A, Gurugram), and iv) an experienced management (the fourth generation is running this family business).  Also Read | Bonanza Portfolio's top stock picks amid ongoing market slump; check here  The firm clocked one of its best pre-sales of Rs 749 crore in FY23, up 94 percent YoY, driven by strong growth in launches along with healthy demand in NCR (absorption grew 41 percent YoY in FY23 compared to a pan-India growth of 30 percent). Volume surged 37 percent YoY to 0.61mn sq. ft. with realisation improving 41 percent YoY.  Recently, ARCP entered the business of building and leasing data centres. We expect demand for data centres to grow manifold due to the government’s intention to implement the data protection bill.  In H1 of FY24, the company has clocked a topline of Rs 600 crore plus with a PAT of Rs 114 crore, as compared to a full year PAT of Rs 149 crore for March 2023. We expect a significant re-rating to Rs 303 in the next 12 to 15 months ahead.  Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,519 | TP: Rs 1,700  Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra reported 19 percent revenue growth and 60 percent PAT growth YoY, surpassing estimates in the first quarter of the current fiscal and projections support further growth for the upcoming quarterly earnings.  Total vehicles sold rose by 21 percent to 1,86,138 compared to the same period last year. Total tractors sold fell by 3 percent to 1,14,293 compared to the same period the previous year. Open bookings for SUVs stand at 281k+, indicating continued strong automotive demand.

Ratnaveer Precision Engineering | CMP: Rs 121 | TP: Rs 204  Ratnaveer Precision Engineering’s (RPEL) business model is extremely scalable and its major advantage is being a fully Indian-grown integrated SS Finishing Sheets &amp;amp; SS Washers player, operating across sectors like automotive, solar power, wind energy, and more, catering to a diverse customer base.  They produce finished sheets, washers, solar roofing hooks, pipes, and tubes. RPEL operates from 4 manufacturing units and has more than 138 customers and a significant export presence, with 60 to 65 percent of revenues from exports.  On a rough estimate, in FY24E, the topline is projected to reach Rs 550 crore, Rs 700 crore in FY25E, and Rs 840 crore in FY26E. We recommend a BUY with a target price of Rs 204 in the next 12 to 15 months.  ICICI Bank | CMP: Rs 213 | TP: Rs 1,150  ICICI Bank has consistently outperformed across metrics. The bank delivered a strong performance in H1FY24, and we anticipate ICICIB to sustain its growth momentum in upcoming quarters. Asset quality is robust, with stable slippages in both retail and corporate segments, bolstered by healthy recoveries.  Credit growth across segments remains buoyant. The bank hasn't seen any softening in demand for secured products and will continue to explore opportunities with a favourable risk-reward ratio. In terms of the unsecured portfolio, ICICI Bank plans to expand its credit card portfolio. However, it will closely monitor the personal loans portfolio. Asset quality trends in personal loans are concerning due to increasing delinquencies, especially in smaller ticket size loans.  ICICI Bank is currently trading at a P/E multiple of 15.6, below the industry median. We suggest a BUY with a TP of Rs 1150.  Also Read | Cash Market - Alkem Laboratories shows a breakout of an inverse head and shoulder pattern  BLS International | CMP: Rs 251 | TP: Rs 325  The visa outsourcing industry is worth $2.6 billion, with high entry barriers. The niche nature of this industry, along with the high entry barriers and few key players in the market, presents a significant opportunity for BLS International. The company currently holds a market share of close to 12 percent and is poised for further growth due to its strong brand positioning and competitive advantage.  BLS International expanded its operations across 60 countries, serving 46 client governments and processing over 62 million applications. BLS anticipates growth in its visa business revenue from both existing contracts and new opportunities in countries like China, Russia, and Malaysia.  BLS is debt-free and has consistently showcased a positive cash flow from operations over the past five years, reporting a cash balance of Rs 340 crores on June 23. The company is India’s sole listed entity in the global visa processing and government-to-citizen services outsourcing market.  The enterprise is asset-light and capital-efficient with robust cash generation and minimal cash consumption for growth. This positions the company intriguingly, especially as a potential benefactor of the anticipated global travel resurgence. We recommend a BUY with a horizon of 12 to 18 months and a TP of Rs 325.

Take a look"," As high flying mid and small cap stocks get battered, there is a growing view among investors that large caps may be a safe haven for now.  That is also because many of the large cap names have been underperforming for a while, making their valuations much more than those of small and midcap names which have seen a sharp upswing over the last six months.

Healthy credit growth (+5% q-o-q)/core fee income (+7% q-o-q) and lower credit cost (21 bps annualised) helped to sustain strong performance despite NIM compression, which was on expected lines (~25 bps q-o-q). Core PPoP grew by 23% y-o-y/1% q-o-q. Asset quality improved sequentially on the back of lower slippages and higher recoveries and upgrades.

We expect margin normalization to continue for most banks and so also for ICICIB mainly due to some moderation in unsecured loan growth amid rising stress/RBI’s rebuke and continued funding cost catch-up. However, the bank’s strong provisioning buffer should keep LLP lower and, thus, support its superior RoA of 2.1-2.4%/RoE of 17-19% over FY24- 26E. We believe the recent stock under-performance has been mainly due to the senior mgmt.’s attrition/rejig dwarfing its otherwise strong financial performance. Outlook However, we take comfort from the strong leadership back-up at ICICIB and are hopeful the bank remains adaptive to limit the unwarranted attrition, as it aspires to build up into a “sustainable &amp;amp; profitable bank” in the long run.

GNPA was lower led by lesser net slippages which resulted in benign credit costs. Loan accretion at 5.0% QoQ was ahead, driven by growth in high yielding segments (PL/CC, SME, auto). Although NIM declined by 21bps QoQ to 4.83%, it was 13bps ahead of PLe due to better treasury management and lower funding cost. Bank expects NIM for FY24E to be similar to FY23. We raise FY24/25/26E core PAT by 3.0-4.0% due to NII increase and lower provisions. Likely RoA/RoE for FY25/26E is 2.0%/17.0%.

If most people have already become believers of the story, finding new faithfuls or converts becomes a tough task","&quot;At any point in time, certain people are being enriched unjustly for the only reason they were there very early.&quot; - Robert Wilson  Bulls are on the backfoot as the mood in global markets continues to be dour. Nobody is in a hurry to load up on stocks but, at the same time, there seems to be no compelling reason to sell either.  Kotak Mahindra Bank  The announcement of a new CEO has done little to cheer analysts tracking the stock, who continue to watch the operating performance hawk-eyed. And, on that front, there does not seem to be much to write home about. Analysts have nice things to say about the asset quality and growth prospects, but are in no hurry to signal a rerating.  ICICI Bank  This stock seems to be suffering from an excess of positive ratings from analysts. But that has not made much of a difference to the price in 2023. The second quarter performance has been impressive, and bullish analysts have set a price target of Rs 1,225 to Rs 1,350. That suggests an upside of anywhere between 30 percent and 40 percent, depending on which analyst you want to believe.  Banking remains the hot favourite among fund managers and that seems to be part of the problem. If most people have already become believers of the story, finding new faithfuls or converts becomes a tough task.  Consensus sell?  Bulk drug firm Laurus Labs' second-quarter numbers have been panned by analysts tracking the stock, as the performance has been weak across    segments. Looking at the analyst commentary, one can’t help get a feeling that the stock may nosedive today. But then, the September quarter numbers are not as bad as the June quarter numbers. Gross margins have in fact improved sequentially, and the stock price too has recovered slightly since then.  Interestingly, while net profits have been steadily sliding for four quarters now, the stock price has fallen by barely 20 percent. This is a market where there are plenty of opportunities available. The management is confident of a recovery in the second half of this year. But two things here. One, the recovery it had promised a quarter back did not materialise in Q2. Two, as broker InCred points out, the company has not given any specific guidance even as it has forecast a recovery for H2. A lot of bad news already seems to be priced in, but bulls in the stock could be in for a long haul.  BSE  The bourse has announced transaction charges for Sensex options effective November 1. So, any increase in market share hereon will start showing up in the bottomline this quarter onwards. Few expected the BSE to give a meaningful fight to the NSE, but it has managed to do that. Expect NSE to get a bit more aggressive in the days ahead. If you are rushing to buy BSE just on news of the transaction charges, think again. The stock has risen almost four-fold from its March lows. The rerating story appears to have played out for the time being. The early birds in the stock will be looking to cash in on a part of their profits. The earnings will now have to play catch up with the higher PE multiple.  Unsecured lending  The RBI recently warned financial institutions that unsecured loans could be getting out of hand. Some analysts see the central bank announcing curbs post-festive season, unless banks and NBFCs start cutting back voluntarily. Some lenders already appear to be doing so.  From a Marcellus note:  “What sets high quality lenders apart is the willingness to throttle off on lending several quarters before other lenders have woken up to the altered realities. There aren’t too many lenders that exemplify this as much as Bajaj Finance and HDFC Bank do.  Bajaj Finance has cut 8-14 percent of its low-ticket unsecured lending business across products owing to concerns of over leverage amongst these customers and imprudent behaviour on the part of these borrowers. HDFC Bank has pulled back on unsecured loans as well. In Q3 FY23, HDFC Banks unsecured book grew 6.3 percent quarter-on-quarter. In the latest quarter, the corresponding growth rate is down to 1.1 percent.”  US stocks  Bank of America’s chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett feels this could be a good time to invest in US stocks as BofA’s Bull &amp;amp; Bear Indicator is now in “extreme bearish” territory at 1.9 from a previous 2.2. Hartnett and team say the buy signal comes amid continued outflows from emerging market debt for the 12th consecutive week. Investor money has also been yanked from high-yield bonds and global equity funds, while fund manager cash levels have risen to 5.3 percent.  Bitcoin dynamics   Bitcoin briefly topped $30,000 twice last week, as crypto supporters are hopeful that a spot bitcoin ETF will soon get SEC’s approval. Besides, uncertainty in US and other global markets are also prompting investors to seek safety in crypto assets.  Solar power  Shares of Nasdaq-listed Israeli solar inverter manufacturer, SolarEdge Technologies Inc crashed 30 percent on Friday after the company warned of &quot;substantial unexpected cancellations and pushouts of existing backlog from European distributors&quot;. Data by Rystad Energy shows some €7 billion ($7.8 billion) worth of solar panels - or 40 gigawatts direct current (GWdc) of capacity - currently sitting unused in European warehouses, reports Oilprice.com. Vast majority of the the solar panels are from China, highlighting the risk of Europe’s over dependence on China for solar panels.  The Japanese Yen  The yen briefly weakened beyond 150 against the dollar again as the wide yield gap between Japan and the US continues to weigh on the Japanese currency. Since US treasury bonds offer a better rate of return, many investors holding assets in the yen may want to switch to US bonds, putting more pressure on the currency. A weak yen is beneficial for carry trade investors. They can borrow in yen, and use that money to invest in any asset offering high returns.  Artificial Intelligence   Chinese technology giants including Alibaba  and Tencent  are among backers of artificial intelligence start-up Zhipu, China’s answer to US’s OpenAI, reports CNBC. Zhipu’s statement about its investors comes at a time when the technology battle between the US and China in the AI sphere is heating up.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/short-call-bulls-at-bay-but-no-kill-for-bears-too-eyes-on-kotak-bank-icici-bank-laurus-labs-bse-and-likely-leash-on-loans-11583721.html

Loan-loss provisions are expected to drop 6 percent YoY, to Rs 1,550 crore.  ALSO READ: Bank stocks take a hit as analysts predict margin pressure in Q2  That said, rising provisions and slower-than-expected loan growth on a sequential basis may lead to NII de-growth by 0.8 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), from Rs 18,226 crore in Q1FY23-24. Loan-loss provisions are likely to climb 20 percent QoQ, while deposits may see a modest growth of 4 percent sequentially, warned analysts. (see table)    Since the pressure is greater on the sequential front, net interest margins (NIMs) are pegged to contract by 35 basis points (bps) QoQ to 4.7 percent in Q2FY23-24, versus 5 percent in Q1FY23-24, due to the rising cost of funds, added analysts. The lender may see some relief on an annual basis as margins are estimated to expand by 14 bps YoY, from 4.5 percent in Q2FY22-23.  No challenges are seen on the asset quality front, said analysts, due to flattish credit costs.  Analysts at Motilal Oswal expect ICICI Bank’s gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) to improve to 2.9 percent in Q2FY23-24, from 3.2 percent in Q2FY22-23. However, no major change was seen from the previous quarter, as the GNPA stood at 2.8 percent in Q1FY23-24.  ALSO READ: Q2FY24 earnings: Bandhan Bank sees 3X rise in net profit; but brokerages raise asset quality concerns  Analysts expect the net NPA to improve to 0.5 percent in Q2FY23-24, from 0.6 percent in Q2FY22-23. It remained unchanged from Q1FY23-24.  On the operational front, analysts at Axis Securities said that the retail and small &amp;amp; medium enterprise (SME) segment will help drive growth in advances by 17 percent YoY in Q2FY23-24.  Meanwhile, deposit growth is likely to climb 16 percent YoY to Rs 12 lakh crore in Q2FY23-24, from Rs 10 lakh crore in the year-ago period, noted analysts at Motilal Oswal.  Besides that, loan growth is projected to rise 16.6 percent YoY to Rs 10 lakh crore in the September quarter, from Rs 9 lakh crore in the year-ago period.  Analysts added that the key factors to watch for in Q2 will be the bank’s commentary on the margin trajectory, traction in operating expenditure cost control, and deposit growth.

For consumer discretionary, his reasoning lies in per capita income rising above $2,000 and, for industrials, it is government policies","Veteran value investor and ex-CIO of HDFC AMC Prashant Jain continues to make contrarian bets, the portfolio of his alternative investment fund 3P Investment Managers reveals. Moneycontrol accessed 3P India Equity Fund's September factsheet to find Jain still betting on NTPC, REC and Coal India.  The fund size is about Rs 5,800 crore with 3.1 percent weightage in NTPC, 3 percent in REC and 0.5 percent in Coal India. Energy and utilities, sectors where Jain sees a steady growth and attractive valuations, make for 13.4 percent of the fund weightage.  Consumer discretionary and industrials/capex are the two sectors Jain's fund is overweight on. For consumer discretionary, his reasoning lies in per capita income rising above $2,000 and, for industrials, it is the supportive government policies.  &quot;The medium to long-term growth outlook of the Indian economy is extremely strong. Everyone is very positive on the India story,&quot; Jain said in a recent interview to Moneycontrol.  Watch: Have value stocks gone overboard right now? | Prashant Jain of 3P Investment Managers answers  Jain's top bets in these sectors include Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra (3 percent), Maruti Suzuki (2 percent), Zomato (2 percent), IndiGo (1.8 percent), Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro (3.7 percent), 3M India (1.5 percent) and Kalpataru Projects (1.1 percent).  Jain has also assigned small weightages to Landmark Cars, Wonderla Holidays, Senco Gold, Anup Engineering, RR Kable, Dynamatic Technologies and Centum Electronics.    Betting on biggies  When it comes to banks, Jain, too, is bullish on the biggest of them all — HDFC Bank. The fund has a 9.3 percent weight assigned to the stock.  Jain expects the bank to continue gaining market share though at a somewhat slower pace due to increased competition, but he believes valuations remain reasonable.  Regarding the management changes and the recent merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank, Jain said, &quot;Management change is inevitable in all companies, and mergers can have a significant impact on near-term results. However, it is well understood by the markets now, and there are several long-term positives in that merger.&quot;    Jain's portfolio also has 8.2 percent weight in ICICI Bank and 7.5 percent in State Bank of India.  Jain is also betting big on his ex-workplace HDFC AMC, with a 2.6 percent weightage. Low penetration of financial products, good growth prospects and reasonable valuations make him bullish on the space. The fund also has an exposure to SBI Life, with 1.3 percent weightage.  In healthcare, the fund is equalweight to the index, with bets in Cipla, Sun Pharma, IPCA Laboratories and Aurobindo Pharma. &quot;These are good businesses and 10-year underperformance relative to Nifty makes it a ripe time for stock picking,&quot; Jain said.  Among miscellaneous bets, the 3P India Equity Fund has 0.4 percent allocation to Time Technoplast and 0.1 percent to Vardhaman Textiles.

icici,2023-10-18T08:39:06+05:30,Santosh Nair,Short Call: Unusual bets fetch big bucks; HDFC Bank vs ICICI Bank; and ticking derivatives time bomb,Unknown traders and investors are making more money with unconventional bets than some of the seasoned players who are sticking to the tried-and-tested themes,"“You never get a bubble until the public, the brokerage community, the financial institutions, the pension funds, and even the universities are all involved.” - Arnold Van Den Berg  Afghanistan beat England, Nederlands beat South Africa. It is the season of upsets in the cricket World Cup.  And, something similar is playing out in the stock market, too, pointed out an investor in smallcap and midcap stocks. Unknown traders and investors are making more money with unconventional bets than some of the seasoned players who are sticking to the tried-and-tested themes. Also, stocks of lesser-known companies are being chased by fund houses and HNIs, much to the consternation of the managements of many large companies.  Karur Vysya Bank  The stock made a fresh 52-week high on Wednesday, after reporting record profits for the September quarter. MD and CEO Ramesh Babu said that there    was pressure on net interest margins as cost of deposits has gone up. But the market appears to be fine with that, as the company looks confident about a 15 percent loan growth for the year. Outlook for the banking sector in general is positive at the moment, but the trouble is that too many people are positive. As ICICI Prudential MF’s S Naren said in an interview to Moneycontrol, a major hurdle to bank stocks’ performance is that too many funds own it.  ICICI Bank vs HDFC Bank  The ICICI Bank may have performed better in recent times, but HDFC Bank could be a better bet at these levels, say the banking analysts at Incred Capital.  Why?  That’s because semi-urban and rural India are the next big growth areas for the Indian banks. Improving ground presence (branches) and faster paced customer acquisition will be key to winning this battle. “We believe that HDFC Bank is relatively better placed on both these formats compared to ICICI Bank, which will ensure granular retail asset growth for the bank, along with consistency in revenues,” said the analyst. Five things that gives Incred the confidence to bank HDFC Bank:  - HDFC Bank has opened more branches in the past three years compared to ICICI Bank - HDFC Bank has more individual bank branches in various locations compared to ICICI Bank - Customers acquired, as measured through debit card issuances, remain higher for HDFC Bank - HDFC Bank has managed its market share dominance in credit card issuances as well as spends - Cross-selling opportunity to existing HDFC mortgage customers is high for HDFC Bank  Derivatives time bomb  Axis Bank MF Chief Investment Officer Ashish Gupta has warned that the outsized derivatives markets themselves can itself be a source of additional macro and market risk, as has been seen global cases with (collateralised debt securities) and derivatives contracts. This is in the backdrop of the massive surge in equity options trading in India. Black swan events and resultant spike in volatility in particular can drive exaggerated moves in stock prices and result in market dislocation, Gupta writes.  And, exchanges appear to have taken a leaf out of the FMCG book to boost sales through sachets. “The introduction of shorter duration in options has effectively 'sachet-sized' trading, reducing the capital needed to take on similar risks. Weekly options are cheaper compared to monthly contracts, and buyers gain exposure to the full notional value by paying only 0.5-5 percent for the same,” he writes.  China  JP Morgan’s James Sullivan says his firm is 'overweight' on China. That is because corporate earnings revisions are below an 18-year average, indicating this could be an inflection.  Shipping  Goldman Sachs has forecast a lengthier and potentially more severe downturn for the global shipping industry, and has warned that the market was still ‘too complacent on the depth and duration of the coming shipping recession’, reports Zerohedge.com. According to Goldman Sachs analyst Patrick Creuset, freight rates and earnings must continue to decline to the point where there was pressure on pressure on shipping companies to phase out expensive tonnage. Shipping companies have been adding capacity even as freight rates continue to slide.  US treasury yields  Borrowing costs for companies in the US may be rising, but consumers don’t seem to be feeling the pinch of higher rates yet. Spending online, at stores and in restaurants rose a stronger-than-expected 0.7 percent in September from a month earlier, according to the latest US retail sales report. Soon after the report, yields on US Treasury bonds jumped around 13 basis points to 4.86 percent. If consumers keep an already robust economy’s engines humming, rates could stay high for longer, and at some point hurt appetite for stocks.  Job openings  On the face of it, the US labour market looks strong, but there may not be as job openings as one would expect. A Gallup report says employers are looking to their current employees to fill in where postings remain open, reports Bloomberg. Almost 60 percent of employees surveyed by Gallup say their organization has recently asked workers to take on additional responsibilities without additional pay.  Enter the dragon  China could come to the rescue of a tight global diesel market once again, as it did at the end of last year, reports Oilprice.com. The West is headed for the winter season of higher heating oil and gasoil consumption amid low diesel stocks in Europe and the US, lower supply of diesel-yielding higher-sulphur crudes from the Middle East. Signs have begun emerging that Chinese diesel and other fuel exports are picking up, the report says.  No diesel  Sweden’s capital Stockholm plans to ban diesel- and gas-powered vehicles from 2025 within a certain region of its downtown area to reduce traffic and pollution, reports CNBC. Stockholm is not the first to test low-emission areas, but this all-out ban is one of the boldest moves by a major European capital.

Because they have a track record of disrupting any segment they enter, telecom being a classic example,” he said.  Parikh’s view is in contrast with that of some banking analysts who feel Jio Financial may not try to disrupt the NBFC segment given that the dynamics of the lending business are much different from say an industry like telecom or retail.  “Right now Jio is quoting at one time book, which is a huge discount to other players. This gap can be bridged if they decide to do things the usual way. But if Jio decides to adopt a similar strategy that it had in the telecom sector, which is to cut prices sharply, then it is bad news for other players. When market booms, financials do well, but at this point valuations of financial services firms are not exactly cheap” he said.  Also Read: A question of values: How Jio Financial Services stacks up against rivals  “You have banks like HDFC Bank and Kotak having net interest margins of anywhere between 3-4 percent. Now it has become easier to raise money from overseas markets cheaply. If you are saying that some of the Indian banks are world class, then their margins too will have to comparable to those of world class companies. Globally NIMs are between 1-1.5. So I think in India too NIMs will contract. The second thing that will happen is that fintech companies and smart NBFCs like Bajaj Finance and Chola will take away market share in the small ticket loan segment. Right now the share of financials in the index is 40-45 percent. I think that can come down by a good extent,” he said.  Parikh said the good thing about banks and financial services right now is that the asset quality is much better than what it has been in a long time.

Like most other sectors, here too investors may have to put up with high valuations for a while, he feels.  “India’s infrastructure is also going to grow in a big way….lot of it is in the price already, I am not saying rush in to buy today,” he said.  “For instance, Timken US has stopped manufacturing two of their products in the US and now producing them in India.

A bench of Justices Aniruddha Bose and Bela M Trivedi issued notice to Chanda Kochhar and her husband on the probe agency's petition and sought their responses in three weeks.  &amp;nbsp;  Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, appearing for the CBI, said the high court proceeded on a wrong presumption that the offence is punishable with maximum of seven years imprisonment without considering section 409 of the IPC (criminal breach of trust by public servant) which entails sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.  &amp;nbsp;  The bench asked Raju how section 409 of the IPC came into play when ICICI was a private bank. Raju replied that the bank may be private but it involves public money.  &amp;nbsp;  The bench said it is issuing notice to the couple and seeking their replies in three weeks.  &amp;nbsp;  The CBI has challenged the January 9 order of the high court granting interim relief to the Kochhars.  &amp;nbsp;  The top court had on October 10 questioned the CBI over not objecting to repeated extension of the two-week interim bail granted to them in January this year.  &amp;nbsp;  The high court had pulled up the CBI for arresting the couple in a &quot;casual and mechanical&quot; manner and &quot;clearly without application of mind&quot; in the loan fraud case and granted them interim bail.  &amp;nbsp;  The CBI arrested the Kochhars on December 23, 2022 in connection with the Videocon-ICICI Bank loan fraud case.  &amp;nbsp;  The couple had moved the HC challenging their arrest, terming it as &quot;illegal and arbitrary&quot;. They had sought their release from jail on bail by way of an interim order.  &amp;nbsp;  The high court had said the Kochhars' arrest was not in accordance with the provisions of law and they were entitled to be released on bail, pending the hearing and final disposal of their petitions.  &amp;nbsp;  The grounds for arresting the petitioners (Kochhars), as stated in the arrest memos, are unacceptable and contrary to the reason(s)/ ground(s) on which a person can be arrested, it had said.  &amp;nbsp;  Apart from the Kochhars, the CBI also arrested Videocon group founder Venugopal Dhoot in the case.  &amp;nbsp;  The central agency has alleged the ICICI Bank sanctioned credit facilities to the tune of Rs 3,250 crore to the companies of the Videocon group in violation of the Banking Regulation Act, Reserve Bank of India's guidelines and credit policy of the top private lender.  &amp;nbsp;  The CBI had named Chanda Kochhar, who was ICICI Bank CEO and MD from 2009 to 2018, Deepak Kochhar, Dhoot along with a slew of firms – Nupower Renewables (NRL), Supreme Energy, Videocon International Electronics Ltd and Videocon Industries – as accused in the FIR registered under Indian Penal Code sections related to criminal conspiracy and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA).  &amp;nbsp;  Nupower Renewables is managed by Deepak Kochhar.  &amp;nbsp;  The central agency has alleged as quid pro quo (favour or advantage granted in return for something), Videocon group founder Dhoot made an investment of Rs 64 crore in Nupower Renewables through Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd (SEPL), and transferred SEPL to Pinnacle Energy Trust managed by Deepak Kochhar through a circuitous route between 2010 and 2012.

The news sent ICICI Securities shares soaring over 5 percent. The stock rose to an intraday high of Rs 652, before paring gains and closing at Rs 635, up 2.4 percent from the previous close.  Norway’s Norges Bank Investment Management's Government Pension Fund Global holds 3.13 percent stake in ICICI Securities.

While PMS directly credit the shares to their clients' accounts, they still hold the power of attorney to operate those and vote.  On June 29, ICICI Securities announced that it will delist and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of its parent company ICICI Bank. Public shareholders of the broking firm would be allotted 67 equity shares of ICICI Bank for every 100 equity shares of the company.

Over 500 shareholders have joined Guptha's Telegram channel to decide on the next course of action.  &quot;During the ICICI Securities IPO in 2018, the shares were offered at a valuation of 30x trailing earnings.

Shareholders eye re-rating of ICICI Securities stock  Minority shareholders believe that the stock, which has not shown any fireworks since listing, is finally ripe for a re-rating. The company has been diversifying its revenue streams and has a good dividend yield of 3.06 percent. As of June end, the company was sitting on cash and cash equivalents of Rs 8,093 crore.

icici,2023-08-21T12:42:48+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, TVS, L&amp;T among top picks by Jefferies; Here’s why","Within financials, its top picks include ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finance, ICICI Prudential Life, Cholamandalam Finance and SBI Cards.","Global brokerage firm Jefferies is bullish on names like ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, TVS Motor, Tata Motors and L&amp;amp;T, among others, due to factors like superior growth, demand pick up and margin recovery.  Here are the top ‘buy’ recommendations by Jefferies, categorised into various sectors.  Financials  ICICI Bank  “ICICI Bank is among our top picks across Indian financials as we believe that the bank can sustain superior growth, better asset quality and higher ROEs,” it said in a report.  The lender is well poised to leverage on growth pickup led by deeper penetration and higher market share in urban micro-markets in metro and near metro areas, it added.  Target Price: Rs 1,240  Axis Bank  “We upgraded Axis Bank to one of our top picks, a few months back as we believe past investments has made the franchise stronger and bank is on track to deliver higher growth and RoEs on a sustainable basis,” Jefferies said.  Integration with Citibank’s India retail platform is progressing well with limited attrition among staff and customers and significant scope for synergies on revenues as well as cost, it added.  Target Price: Rs 1,200  IndusInd Bank  “We believe IndusInd Bank is on track to deliver a turnaround in ROA as it continues to improve core franchise with a focus on building domain specialisation to ramp up on liabilities (NRI, HNI, wealth) and loans (new vehicle loans, micro-banking and SME),” it said.  The bank has a dominant position in segments like commercial vehicles, microfinance and diamond trade finance that form one third of overall loans. It expects 20 percent CAGR in loans over the next 3-5 years and plans to ramp up newer areas like housing, used-car, merchant financing, gold loans and business banking.  Target Price: Rs 1,750  Bajaj Finance  “Bajaj Finance is well positioned to deliver a robust growth of 28 percent CAGR in AUM over the next 3 years as it leverages on expansion into new markets and addition of new products. It plans to enter into segments like commercial vehicles financing, car loans (used and new), micro-lending among others, to capture the gaps in the existing portfolio and support growth over the medium term,” Jeffries said.  The company has built strong digital platforms over the past few years with the intention to improve engagement with existing customers. Its app has over 40 million users and is among the largest finance app downloads in the world.  This can offer scope for operating efficiencies that can compensate some compression in net interest margins (NIMs) in FY24, it added.  Target Price: Rs 8,830  ICICI Prudential Life  “We were encouraged to see pick up in premium growth as a key agenda for the new CEO and CFO of ICICI Prudential Life. Growth will be supported by an expansion in agency, measures to boost productivity, and customer-centric products,” Jefferies noted.  The pain from lower sales in ICICI Bank channel should start tapering off as annualized premium equivalent (APE) of this channel was down 14 percent in June-23 as against a decline of 38 percent in FY23. In 1QFY24, contribution of the bank fell to 13 percent of APE.  “We see limited downside from here and growth should start improving from 2H FY23,” it added.  Target Price: Rs 700  Cholamandalam Finance  “We believe Chola’s AUM should grow at 26 percent CAGR over FY23-26e led by strong demand for auto loans, expansion of loan against property and affordable housing loan branches to its auto finance branches and strong growth momentum in less cyclical new businesses,” it said.  Margins have bottomed and should inch up slowly due to loan mix shift. The company has seen the impact of higher rates upfront versus peers and its cost of funds largely reflects higher rates, it added.  Target Price: Rs 1,350  SBI Cards  “We expect SBI Cards’ card spends and receivables to grow at 23 percent CAGR over FY23-26e given healthy growth in industry card spends and as SBI Cards should gain by increasing penetration within SBI’s large addressable customer base and leveraging its wide range of co-branded card tie ups,” it said.  NIMs could slowly inch up over FY24-26e led by improving EMI/ revolver mix and higher yields on EMI loans, it added.  Target Price: Rs 1,100  Autos  Tata Motors  “We like Tata for the strong ongoing business cycle at JLR, improving Indian commercial vehicle/passenger vehicle demand and a stronger India passenger vehicle franchise,” it said.  At Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), a strong product cycle and easing chip constraints should drive strong operating and financial performance.  Target Price: Rs 800  TVS Motor  “We believe in a strong cyclical recovery in Indian two-wheelers (2Ws) after the abnormal 35 percent fall over FY19-22 for the segment that is core to Indian personal mobility; we believe 2Ws are ripe for a replacement cycle too. We see 2Ws growing at 15 percent CAGR over FY23-26E after rising 19 percent YoY in FY23,” Jefferies said.  TVS has been improving its franchise across multiple segments with attractive product propositions. TVS has risen to No. 2 position in electric two-wheelers space in recent months, and has plans to expand its EV portfolio.  Capital Goods &amp;amp; Logistics  L&amp;amp;T  “We expect 1H FY24E to bring order flow traction as elections drive front-loaded order flow; 2H should benefit from margin recovery as the execution of projects won in an inflated commodity price environment picks up,” Jeffries said.  The brokerage firm believes the peak of non-core investments is behind and L&amp;amp;T has the potential to surprise on execution and order flow expectations  Target Price: Rs 3,050  Thermax  “Management focus is on leveraging its brand in green offerings, improving capital allocation, margin improvement and seeking new renewable energy (RE) growth avenues with global tie-ups,” it said.  Thermax’s brand is well placed for its larger agenda of being a leader for India in terms of clean water, clear air and clean energy by offering new product solutions to its existing customers, Jefferies added.  Target Price: Rs 3,085  Real Estate  Macrotech  “Macrotech (Lodha) is India's largest listed developer by land bank and the largest residential developer by pre-sales in Mumbai. The company enjoys an almost even mix of premium and affordable housing segment,” Jefferies said.  It is also monetizing its large 4,000 acre+ land bank through a combination of digital infrastructure (warehousing / industrial land) and residential township development.  Target Price: Rs 860  Godrej Properties  “GPL is among the top listed residential developer by pre-sales and the only one with a diversified presence across 4 large Tier-1 cities,” it said.  The company has done well on new project adds with Rs550 billion worth of projects added since FY21. Residential prices have moved significantly since then.  Consumer  Godrej Consumer Products  “Godrej Consumer (GCPL) has faced several headwinds in the last two years, ranging from elevated input inflation (led by palm, crude etc.) and slowdown in volume growth, to a sharp decline in its Indonesia business,” it said.  However, this is changing in the last few quarters. Volume growth in India is improving, led by category development initiatives under the new CEO. Input inflation has moderated and margins are recovering to pre-inflation levels, Jefferies added.  Target Price: Rs 1,200  Zomato  “Within Food services, online food delivery at a 12 percent penetration is in its early days in India and can compound at a ~20 percent CAGR in the next decade. What makes the online food delivery market more attractive is the duopoly between Swiggy and Zomato,” it said.  Zomato turned PAT positive in 1Q FY24, way earlier than guidance. Improving profitability across both food delivery and quick commerce should continue to drive sharp earnings growth, it added.  Chemicals  Navin Flourine  “Management maintains FY24 growth guidance in specialty chemicals despite demand volatility as newly commissioned capacities ramp up and expects growth to accelerate in FY25,” it said.  Jefferies has forecast 26 percent PAT CAGR over FY23-26 -- the strongest in its chemical’s coverage.  Target Price: Rs 5,475  Pharma &amp;amp; Healthcare  Sun Pharma  “Sun Pharma is the largest player in the domestic market with market share of ~8.5 percent. With a very strong product portfolio on both Acute and Chronic segment, the business should sustainably clock low double-digit growth,” Jefferies said.  A ramp up in products like Cequa and Winlevi will help to grow the US business at high single to low double-digit even if sales of generic business do not increase from hereon, it added.  Target Price: Rs 1,310  Max Healthcare  “Max Healthcare will be increasing bed capacity by 85 percent in next 4-5 years where more than 60 percent of the beds are brownfield beds which will have shorter breakeven time and higher EBITDA margins,” it said.  Max Healthcare will get 400 new beds capacity in FY24 while 100 new brownfield beds came up in 4QFY23, where the breakeven was within the first month of operation.  Target Price: Rs 650  Medanta  “Medanta's mature hospitals demonstrate a steady margin profile, while its new hospitals in Lucknow and Patna are expected to ramp-up strongly and drive overall Ebitda CAGR of 18 percent over FY23-25E,” it said.  The flagship unit in Gurgaon has started new specialties and ramped up doctor hiring in high-demand areas, this will result in healthy growth numbers in this mature unit also, the report said.  Cement  UltraTech Cement  “UltraTech Cement, India’s number 1 cement producer with a pan-India footprint and Jun-23 domestic capacity at ~130 mtpa, is expanding its domestic cement capacity organically to 158 mn tonnes by FY25/FY26. Including International Operations, capacity will move from current 136 mtpa to 163 mtpa during the same period,” it said.  Cement demand growth has seen a sharp uptick in the last 2 years with double-digit growth for FY23/1Q FY24 at 11 percent and 16 percent, respectively. The strong growth is driven by real estate pickup and increased infra-segment allocation by the central government.

Between June 2009 to October 2011, RTLs of a total of Rs 1,875 crore were sanctioned to the group by the bank, the charge sheet said.","The credit facilities sanctioned by the ICICI Bank to the Videocon group turned into non-performing assets (NPAs) of more than Rs 1,000 crore, the CBI has claimed in the charge sheet filed against the bank's former CEO Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and Videocon founder Venugopal Dhoot.  The over 10,000 pages-long charge sheet was filed recently before a special court for the Central Bureau of Investigation cases in Mumbai.  The Kochhars and Dhoot are now out on bail.  After Chanda Kochhar became MD &amp;amp; CEO of ICICI Bank, from May 1, 2009, six 'Rupee Term Loans' (RTLs) were sanctioned to Videocon Group. Between June 2009 to October 2011, RTLs of a total of Rs 1,875 crore were sanctioned to the group by the bank, the charge sheet said.  Chanda Kochhar was chairperson of the two-member Committee of Directors which sanctioned RTL of Rs 300 crore in August 2009 to Videocon International Electronics Limited (VIEL).  Further, she was a member of the committee of senior managers (recommending committee) as well as credit committee (sanctioning committee) for sanctioning RTL of Rs 750 crore to Videocon Industries Limited (VIL) in October 2011, the CBI charge sheet said.  She was a member of the committees which sanctioned various loan limits to Videocon Group even after 2012, it added.  &quot;The credit facilities sanctioned by ICICI Bank to Videocon Group turned into NPAs in June 2017, with an outstanding amount of Rs 1,033 crore. Thereby, ICICI Bank had to suffer loss of Rs 1,033 crore plus interest thereupon,&quot; the charge sheet said.  Dhoot, the Kochhars and others &quot;engineered a plan and design in December 2008, after the announcement of appointment of Ms Chanda Kochhar as MD and CEO of ICICI Bank, to get sanctioned loans to the Videocon Group,&quot; it alleged.  Chanda Kochhar lived in a flat owned by Videocon Group in Mumbai. Later, the flat was transferred to her family trust (Deepak Kochhar being its managing trustee) for just Rs 11 lakh in October 2016. The actual value of the flat was Rs 5.25 crore, the CBI said.  She accepted &quot;illegal gratification&quot; of Rs 64 crore and also thereby misappropriated the bank's funds for her own use, the charge sheet said.  Deepak Kochhar conspired with others to get sanctioned credit facilities by ICICI Bank in favour of Videocon Group through his wife, to obtain illegal gratification of Rs 64 crore in the garb of investments (in companies controlled by him) through a web of transactions, it said.  The other accused named by the CBI are Nupower Renewables (NRL) managed by Deepak Kochhar, Supreme Energy, Videocon International Electronics Ltd and Videocon Industries Limited.

We expect NIMs to moderate QoQ (down 12bps QoQ in 1Q), as costs catch up, but should be still up 15-20bps for full year in FY24E, as the pace of fall should be slower vs the rise in FY23. Factoring-in the healthy NIMs, coupled with fees/lower LLP, we revise earnings for FY24-26E by 3-7% and expect Bank to deliver superior RoA of ~2.2-2.3%/RoE of ~18% over the same period. Outlook We retain BUY, with revised TP of Rs1,330/share, valuing the core bank at 3x its Jun-25E ABV (assigning a slight premium over HDFCB) and subsidiaries at Rs170/share. Our 12-Jul-2023 sector note The Old Order Changeth, Yielding place to New highlighted the rising mid/senior Management attrition across banks, as also for ICICIB.

Core PPoP grew 35% YoY, while NIMs moderated 12bp QoQ to 4.8%. Business growth was strong, with overall loans growing 18% YoY. Asset quality remained broadly stable with PCR at 83%. The bank maintains a total contingency buffer of INR131b. ICICIBC is well positioned to deliver steady earnings, supported by pristine asset quality and strong momentum in business growth. We estimate RoA/RoE of 2.2%/17.9% in FY25. After a strong outperformance backed by robust earnings growth (3yr CAGR of ~60%), we estimate earnings growth to moderate to an 18% CAGR over FY23-25, affected largely by a decline in margins and limited levers available on the opex/credit cost front.

Likely RoE trajectory has improved by 30-60bps to 16.4-16.8% (over FY24-26E). Sharp focus on core PPoP may lead to more upgrades. ICICIB delivered another stellar quarter with core PAT at Rs92.4bn beating PLe by 10.2% led by better NII, fees and lower provisions. Loan accretion at 3.7% QoQ was ahead, driven by superior growth in high yielding segments (PL/CC and SME). Healthy credit demand and benign asset quality provides leeway to invest in business, since NIM would be cushioned by strong unsecured growth and controlled slippages. Outlook ICICIB is trading at a premium (currently 5%) to HDFCB (merged), which should remain so in near to medium term given its superior RoA/RoE profile. Maintaining multiple at 3.0x, we raise SOTP based TP to from Rs1180 to Rs1130. Reiterate ‘BUY’.

A loan is written off when the bank thinks that there is no scope for recovery from that particular account. Banks need to set aside money, called provisions, to cover losses from such accounts, which impacts their profitability.  The bank's management said the write-offs were routine. “The write-offs in this quarter is routine and is line with our policy.

The provision coverage ratio (PCR), or the percentage of funds that a bank sets aside for losses due to bad debts, stood at 82.4 percent, higher than 79.6 percent in the year-ago quarter. A high PCR is a positive element for banks to buffer themselves against losses.

This, analysts said, would be on the back of higher provisions. By comparison, it was Rs 9,121.9 crore in the March quarter of FY23 (Q4FY23) and Rs 6,904.9 crore in Q1FY23.  Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher expect Mumbai-based ICICI Bank's provisions to rise 17.3 percent on quarter and 66 percent on year to Rs 1,900 crore. Whereas Kotak Institutional Equities pegs the same at Rs 1,700.8 crore, up five percent QoQ (from Rs 1,619.8 crore) and 49 percent YoY (from Rs 1,143.8 crore).   ICICI Bank Q1FY24 Preview  &quot;We expect provisions at Rs 1,701 crore, and expect to see lower recovery/upgrades hereon. We are building slippages of 2.5 percent (around Rs 6,500 crore) as Q1FY24 slippages could be higher from the agriculture portfolio. The key concern would be the reversal of net interest margin (NIM) as cost of funds is starting to move up sharply for the sector, especially with slower current account-savings account (CASA) growth,&quot; Kotak Institutional Equities stated in a results preview report.  Analysts expect net interest margin (NIM) to contract 10 basis points sequentially to 4.8 percent from 4.9 percent. In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, NIM stood at four percent. Operationally, net interest income (NII) is also expected to stay muted quarter-on-quarter, with brokerages forecasting a drop of up to two percent to Rs 17,571 crore.  &quot;We expect NII to de-grow by 1.3 percent QoQ even as loan growth seen at two percent, since NIM decline of 11bps QoQ would be more due to higher floating rate portfolio,&quot; said Prabhudas Lilladher.  “First quarter of NIM decline after 3 strong quarters. NIM to decline 15bp and loan growth will be 3.5 percent QoQ. NII growth will be lower than previous quarters at 1.5 percent QoQ,” said Nuvama Equities.  On average, brokerages expect cost-to-income (C/I) ratio to rise by 193bps QoQ (down 117bps YoY) to 41.2 percent. Credit costs, meanwhile, may stay between 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent. Gross NPA ratio is seen rising marginally to 2.9 percent from 2.8 percent QoQ.

Whereas, Motilal Oswal has given a target price of Rs 1,150 in a research report dated April 23, 2023.

Check out share swap ratio,Public shareholders of the broking firm would be allotted 67 equity shares of ICICI Bank for every 100 equity shares of the company.,"ICICI Securities on June 29 announced that it will delist and become a wholly owned subsidiary of its parent company ICICI Bank. Public shareholders of the broking firm would be allotted 67 equity shares of ICICI Bank for every 100 equity shares of the company.  &quot;The scheme is subject to receipt of requisite approvals from ICICI Bank and the company's shareholders' and creditors, Reserve Bank of India, National Company Law Tribunal, stock exchanges and other regulatory and statutory authorities,&quot; the exchange filing stated.  On June 28, ICICI Securities' stock closed at Rs 615.95 and ICICI Bank closed at Rs 939.95 on the NSE. Based on this, the share swap ratio indicates that ICICI Securities' shareholders getting only a two percent premium.  ALSO READ: What does the ICICI Securities delisting move mean for investors?  Explaining the rationale behind the decision, ICICI Bank said, &quot;ICICI Securities is a low capital consuming business and the internal accruals are more than adequate to fund business growth. ICICI Bank is not expected to be required to make additional capital infusion into the company.&quot;  As of March 2023, ICICI Bank held 74.85 percent stake in ICICI Securities. The delisting process is expected to be completed in 12-15 months.  Also Read: ICICI Securities is cash-rich and on a growth path.

Another reason cited behind the delisting move is that the securities broking business is inherently cyclical as it is significantly dependent on macro-economic environment and buoyancy in equities market.  In Q4 FY23, ICICI Securities reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 263 crore, down 23 percent as against Rs 340 crore reported in the corresponding period of last year.

icici,2023-06-26T15:39:32+05:30,Shailaja Mohapatra,ICICI Securities is cash-rich and on a growth path. Does ICICI Bank feel it is undervalued?,ICICI Securities is among the top five brokerages in the country with 7 percent market share of active National Stock Exchange clients,"ICICI Bank’s proposal to delist its subsidiary ICICI Securities has surprised the market. The broking firm is on a growth path and delisting it at the right time will give it more freedom to innovate in the highly disruptive sector, believe most market participants.  As cash market volumes took a hit after the COVID-19 lockdown, ICICI Securities was quick to diversify. It has been growing its derivatives segment steadily even as it expanded into loans and wealth management. It also remains among the top five brokerages in the country with 7 percent market share of active National Stock Exchange clients.  For instance, the proportion of cash equity broking in the company’s overall revenue has decreased to 20 percent from over 50 percent a few years ago. Derivative brokering revenue has now been increasing for the last seven quarters and currently stands at about 15 percent of the total revenue stack. Share of distribution business revenue has jumped from 19 percent to 22 percent in a year.  “Furthermore, the company is sitting on cash and cash equivalents of Rs 6,790 crore and is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11x. At 42 percent, it has high return on equity compared to other listed brokers. Yet, the market is not rerating the stock. So the promoter might have decided to take matter into its own hands,” said a fund manager, on condition of anonymity.  ICICI Bank holds 74.85 percent in ICICI Securities.  Big plans awaiting?  The news around the delisting comes at a point when the company is clearly gearing for a mega transition, said Nirav Karkera, head of research at financial services firm Fisdom. “ICICI Securities is improving its product mix by focusing on high-margin products,” he added. From 52 percent in FY20, the broking firm has taken its operating margins to 62 percent in FY23.    The ramp-up in the wealth management business has been a big margin driver. The firm has 78,000 customers in this segment with assets of Rs 3.2 lakh crore under management. In the quarter gone by, it also increased its market share by about 30 basis points in the derivatives segment with the launch of products such as Flash Trade, Algos, APIs, Option Plus, etc. Another such product is also in the works, said a person familiar with the development.  The third growth lever identified by the management is the distribution of loans. ICICI Securities distributed a total of about Rs 3,750 crore of loans for FY23, a 66 percent growth on an annualised basis. “We went live with our arrangement with Tata Capital for loan against shares as well as personal loans. So, we should start seeing some traction in this as well,” managing director Vijay Chandok had said in the Q4 earnings conference call.  What’s in it for the bank?  In this context, it becomes easier for the promoter to delist the company and explore cross-selling opportunities.  “It is likely that the capital required for expansion can be met in-house. Moreover, the bank can leverage ISec’s capabilities as a distribution arm which would provide more freedom to innovate,” said Rikesh Parikh, principal officer at Rockstud Capital.  Notably, most bank-owned securities companies like HDFC Securities, Kotak Securities and Axis Securities are closely held. So ICICI Bank’s announcement is in line with what its peers are doing.  “ICICI Securities is valued at a discount when analysts do a sum-of-parts valuation for ICICI Bank, as is the case with most holding companies. Once ICICI Securities is integrated with the bank, the earnings will be consolidated under the bank and that part of earnings will also get the same valuation as that of the bank, mean could result in a overall pop,” said an analyst covering the sector, who did not want to be identified.  A long-drawn process  Contrary to expectations of a cash payout, the delisting will be done through a share swap process. This means shareholders of ICICI Securities will get shares of ICICI Bank. The swap ratio will be announced after the board meeting to be held on June 29.  “The ratio has to be closely watched. The delisting process will be successful if shareholders accept the proposal and are willing to swap, thus taking promoters stake up till 90 percent,” said Shriram Subramanian, founder of InGovern, a corporate governance research firm.  All eyes are now on the merger ratio. On June 26, ICICI Securities' stock ended at Rs 626, higher by 11 percent from previous close.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/icici-securities-is-cash-rich-and-on-a-growth-path-does-icici-bank-feel-it-is-undervalued-10859191.html

Furthermore, sources told CNBC-TV18 that ICICI Bank may consider the delisting proposal through a share swap instead of a cash payout. As of the March quarter, ICICI Bank held a 74.85 percent stake in its broking arm.

Follow our live blog for all the market action  The decision comes five years after the broking firm made its debut on the bourses. In April 2018, the Rs 4,000 crore-IPO of ICICI Securities had received poor response. &quot;On its listing date, it was listed below the issue price and since then the stock has mostly underperformed benchmark indices,&quot;  Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities said.  The IPO was subscribed 78 percent overall, with retail investors bidding only 89 percent of the allotted quota.  In Q4, ICICI Securities reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 263 crore for the quarter ended March, down 23 percent as against Rs 340 crore reported in the corresponding period of last year.  The board in April recommended a final dividend of Rs 9.25 per equity share of face value of Rs 5 each to shareholders of the company.  After Q4 results, global research and broking firm Citi had said that near-term cost pressures will continue to weigh on ICICI Securities' earnings. It has a 'sell' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 440 per share.  To reduce dependence on broking, the company had been diversifying into wealth management, loans and general insurance.

The second largest private sector lender's corporate social responsibility (CSR) arm will spend the money over a nearly four-year period to build three facilities at Kharghar in Navi Mumbai on the outskirts of the financial capital, Mullanpur in Punjab and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh.  Girish Chandra Chaturvedi, the chairman of the second largest private sector lender, said the three facilities will be fully functional by 2027 and will enable TMC to handle 25,000 more cancer patients per year, which will be 25 per cent higher than the current capacity to treat about 1.2 lakh patients a year.  &quot;This (the financial commitment) is a step towards resolving a problem which we are foreseeing to aggravate, especially as urbanisation increases,&quot; he told reporters at TMC's flagship hospital here after signing three Memorandums of Understanding for the centre.  Chaturvedi said the bank has Rs 500 crore of CSR corpus ready right now for the three facilities, and will be adding to the corpus as the years go. By the end of the spending cycle, the overall CSR corpus will be Rs 2,500 crore, which means the bank will be spending 50 per cent of its overall money on this partnership, Chaturvedi said.  He added that at present, the bank spends about 25 percent of its CSR budget on healthcare which may go up or down depending on the need.  Rajendra Badwe, the director of the country's most premier cancer treatment and research institution, said cancer prevalence is higher in urban areas, and the number of those who get affected by it is set to increase with a jump in urbanization.  In all the three places, the hospital already has a presence and the money received from ICICI Bank will be put into a brownfield expansion for new phases and blocks, Badwe said, adding that the operational expenses for its running will be borne by the Department of Atomic Energy.  He added that TMC has created a hub and spoke model, under which there is a bigger facility or hub in certain pockets of the country like Varanasi, Punjab, Guwahati etc having dedicated facilities to deal with both common and uncommon cancers, while the spokes are a step down facilities having only the common cancer treatment.  Under this partnership, TMC's advanced centre for treatment, research and education in cancer in Navi Mumbai will get a radiation oncology block, while ICICI Foundation will also set up two paediatric and haematological oncology blocks at TMC's Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Centre at Mullanpur in Punjab, and Visakhapatnam.  TMC treats around two-thirds of its patients for free, while 20 per cent get it at a markup of 10 per cent over the actual costs, while the remaining ones pay over 60 per cent higher. The remaining shortfall between revenue collections and the costs incurred is received from the government and from corporate donors, Badwe said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/icici-bank-commits-rs-1200-cr-to-help-tata-memorial-centre-build-3-cancer-facilities-pan-india-10734131.html

Prasanna, group head for global markets sales, trading and research at ICICI Bank Ltd, the nation’s second-largest private lender by market value, said in an interview Monday.","India’s central bank may buy as much as 1.5 trillion rupees ($18 billion) of government bonds to replenish banking liquidity that’s expected to tighten later in the year, according to a top banker.  The Reserve Bank of India may cut the cash reserve ratio by half a point in the fiscal second half and start buying bonds in the December quarter to keep banking liquidity at current levels, B. Prasanna, group head for global markets sales, trading and research at ICICI Bank Ltd, the nation’s second-largest private lender by market value, said in an interview Monday.  Liquidity is likely to tighten in the banking system as higher spending amid state elections due later in the year may lead to money leaving the system. A number of key states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have elections due, and that will coincide with the busy credit season in October when demand picks up in the economy.  “The currency in circulation will remain high due to a number of state elections and national elections next year,” Prasanna said. “The currency coming in will go out as people take out the cash.”    Excess liquidity in the banking system has narrowed to about 740 billion rupees from this year’s high of about 3 trillion rupees in April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Economics. To ease the squeeze, the RBI injected about 468 billion rupees into the banking system on May 19 via a repo auction, the first such injection since March.  Still, some lenders like Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. have said the RBI’s withdrawal of the highest value 2,000 rupee notes from circulation this month will replenish liquidity and lower the probability of bond purchases in the fiscal second half.  The move is expected to add about one trillion rupees of banking liquidity, according to estimates. It follows the RBI’s higher-than-expected dividend payout to the government, which may also boost cash in the system.  The current liquidity addition has brought down funding rates, creating scope for a rally in notes maturing in five years and less, Prasanna said. The 5-year yield may drop to 6.8% levels, while the one-year treasury bill can fall to 6.75%, he said. The 10-year bond doesn’t have much scope for rally now with interest rates expected to having peaked, he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/rbi-may-need-to-buy-18-billion-of-bonds-to-add-cash-says-icici-bank-10656361.html

icici,2023-04-28T10:16:39+05:30,Andy Mukherjee,"India’s banks have it all, except caution","Strong profit growth has put Indian financiers’ optimism in overdrive, but is it sustainable? Skimping on loss provisions is risky, especially when this strategy has backfired in the past","India’s banks spent most of the last decade out in the wilderness, as a punishment for the lax underwriting standards on their corporate loans. Now they have regained their health, restored profitability and reestablished investors’ trust. The benchmark Nifty Bank Index is close to an all-time high. With everything going well, the lenders should be turning cautious. But recent full-year results show an opposite trend: Provisions for future loan losses are beginning to decline. This may not be prudent.  Across most of Asia, muted big-ticket consumer expenditure — such as on housing — and restrained capital expenditure by firms have led to only a mild post-pandemic recovery in credit, which makes India’s double-digit loan growth a notable exception, according to economists at Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd Just last month, New Delhi-based developer DLF Ltd sold $1 billion worth of million-dollar homes on the outskirts of the national capital in 72 hours. A one-year, 29 percent jump in credit-card debt has made even the Reserve Bank of India, the regulator, a little uncomfortable. The central bank has cautioned lenders about the risk of delinquencies on their unsecured loans at meetings over at least the past three months, Reuters reported recently.  Yet, HDFC Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd, two of the country's largest lenders by market value, slashed their loss provisions for the financial year that ended in March by 23 percent. The money ICICI has set aside cumulatively is now 9 billion rupees ($122 million) less than a year ago. That isn’t a problem yet, because gross nonperforming assets have declined at a faster pace of 27 billion rupees. However, there’s nothing to suggest that they won’t rise again.  With the incremental credit-to-deposit ratio running at 111 percent, Indian banks will have to pay more to savers — sacrificing some part of their high profitability. Although even this won’t affect all lenders equally. Higher deposit costs “will tip the scale in favor of our rated banks, allowing them larger bargaining power to price the loans and hence to defend their margins,” according to Rebecca Tan, a senior analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. Problems may erupt elsewhere. “The key risk we are watching really is the quality of these bank loans to small-and-medium-sized enterprises and that’s predominantly because of the current rising rate environment,” she said in a Bloomberg TV interview last month.  Since then, an unexpected pause in monetary tightening by the central bank has provided some reprieve, though the effects of a cumulative 250-basis-point increase in rates will be felt for some more time. High interest rates may be particularly worrisome for the risk-chasing behavior of nonbank financial institutions, or NBFIs, which don’t have access to low-cost deposits. “We believe more NBFIs are pursuing higher-yielding loans to offset greater pressure on funding costs and net interest margins,” Fitch Ratings said Thursday. Aggressive growth could “pressure lenders to take inordinate risks, which could weaken asset quality and credit profiles when the economic cycle turns,” it added.  Banks aren’t exactly oblivious to the danger. Excluding retail and rural lending, ICICI now has only 0.8 percent of its loan portfolio exposed to riskier firms rated BB or below. Two years ago, the figure was as high as 3.6 percent. Axis Bank Ltd, the fifth-largest lender, didn’t have to utilise its COVID-19-related loss cushion in the March quarter. As a result, even with a 64 percent drop in full-year provisions, it still has gross bad loans covered to the extent of 145 percent. However, all of this is backward looking. The retail loan book for both HDFC Bank and ICICI has grown by 1 trillion rupees apiece over the past 12 months. Axis saw almost a 900 billion rupee increase, while Bajaj Finance Ltd, a specialist nonbank lender to consumers and small firms, expanded its assets by about 500 billion rupees. Retail credit by just these four Indian lenders has expanded by almost the same amount in one year as the entire growth in the Thai banking system over the past four. And yet, Bajaj, too, has cut back on loss provisions by 34 percent.  Clearly, strong profit growth has put Indian financiers’ optimism in overdrive, but is it sustainable? The previous bout of unbridled enthusiasm for corporate lending ended with more than $200 billion in nonperforming assets, one of the world’s worst piles of bad loans. This time around, individuals’ data has replaced the collateral of plants and machines. Digital lending is the new mantra. The belief seems to be that any lender whose portfolio of unsecured retail loans is not increasing by 50 percent annually is simply not trying hard enough.  &amp;nbsp;  But consumer demand is being led by a small pocket of affluence. The 6.5 percent growth in gross domestic product that the government is penciling in for the fiscal year that began this month faces several risks. Turmoil in the US banking industry is making India’s $245 billion software-export industry gloomy. A sustained rise in oil prices, currently kept in check by  global growth concerns, would crimp already-limited purchasing power of urban low- and middle-income workers amid high unemployment. Meanwhile, climate change could dash any hope of a recovery in stagnant real wages in rural areas. Summer temperatures are above normal by about 5 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit) in many parts of the country. Heat waves could damage crops and cause power shortages.  It’s time lenders behaved a little more prudently. The aggregate bad-loan ratio of 4.41 percent at the end of last year was the lowest since March 2015. The system has “remained resilient and not been affected by the recent sparks of financial instability seen in some advanced economies,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in a web-streamed address Thursday. Still, the central bank has “started looking at the business models of banks more closely,” he said. As it indeed should. For years, the stock market couldn’t expect even 1 percent return on assets from a vast swathe of the Indian banking industry. Now that things have changed, 2 percent should be good enough for current investors — with the rest of the profit kept aside to deal with future losses. Unusual as it is from a regional perspective, the credit upswing in India may not be at a risk of abrupt reversal. But since it’s a cycle, at some point it will turn.

icici,2023-04-24T13:03:15+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan,Banking Central | Two private lenders make the field for bulls in banking space,ICICI Bank numbers add to the optimism in the sector while RBI clarifications offer much needed clarity to HDFC Bank’s investors.  ,"Over the weekend, all eyes were on the ICICI Bank, as the lender announced a good set of numbers on Saturday. The key numbers—both on growth and asset quality—throw up good news for the bank and map the road ahead for the industry. Typically, big bank earnings are good indicators of the banking system health and business momentum.  The lender’s loan book grew around 19 percent on a year-on-year basis, while deposits grew by 11 percent. The net interest margin, the spread between interest earned and interest expended, jumped sharply to 4.90 percent in Q4 of FY2023 as against 4 percent same period last year.  These numbers add to the industry’s optimism of a sharp turnaround.  To be sure, one needs to wait for other large banks to confirm a pattern but if ICICI Bank numbers are any indication, the Indian banking industry is looking at a bull run ahead. On the asset quality front, most of the large-ticket NPA cases are either pushed to the bankruptcy court or written off.  According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, the gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) declined to 4.5 percent in December 2022 from 6.5 percent a year ago. According to RBI rules, a loan is classified as NPA if there is no repayment of principal or interest for a period of 90 days. Banks have to set aside money, called provisions, against such loans. This impacts their profitability.   Banking Central  Loan demand too is picking up and large banks are looking at quality projects to fund on the wholesale side while the broader thrust seems to be on the retail book. In case of ICICI Bank, the lender’s retail loan portfolio grew 22.7 percent on-year and comprised 54.7 percent of the total loan portfolio at March 31, 2023. Its business banking portfolio grew 34.9 percent YoY on March 31, 2023, while small medium enterprises (SME) business grew by 19.2 percent YoY. ICICI Bank's rural portfolio widened 13.8 percent on-year and 5.5 percent on-quarter at March 31, 2023. The credit growth, across the industry shows signs of revival after the pandemic phase.  RBI clarification for HDFC Bank  The second major event for the banking sector was a clarification for the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger following certain requests made by the lender ahead of the merger. Among the issues the regulator has clarified, the two key ones-- related to priority sector lending obligations (PSL) and treatment of investments in subsidiaries—are important. The RBI has permitted HDFC Bank to spread the additional PSL over three years.  PSL refers to mandatory lending by banks to economically weaker sections of the society. Banks have to lend at least 40 percent of their money to such segments, of which 18 percent must be to agriculture. Given the size of the merged entity, this would have been a tremendous burden for HDFC Bank in the initial years of transition. Failure to meet PSL will require banks to invest in RIDF (Rural Infrastructure Development Fund) of Nabard. The staggered implementation of PSL will lessen the burden on the bank and impact on margins.  Also, permission to increase stake in HDFC Life and HDFC Ergo will help the bank mitigate the valuation concerns of subsidiaries. In the approaching days, we will see more banks announcing their quarterly earnings which should give further clarity on the business momentum.

Better NIM at 5.3% (PLe 5.2%) was offset by higher opex due to one-time employee cost. Loan growth was 4.7% QoQ (in-line), led by retail/SME while asset quality was superior due to lower net slippages. Bank further fortified its balance sheet, as provisions for Q4FY23 were mainly contingent in nature. Buffer provisions at 129bps are best in-class. As focus would be on sustaining growth, branch accretion in FY24E would be higher than FY23 (482 branches). Thus, we are factoring a higher opex CAGR of 17% over FY23-25E (earlier 14%) and lower FY24/25E earnings by ~2%.

Core credit cost &amp;amp; net slippages were almost negligible, which was a key major positive. The bank currently has contingent provision buffers of 1.3% of loans. Deposits growth marginally outpaced loan growth q-o-q, which was also a key positive. Loan growth remained healthy and was broad-based, up 19% y-o-y and 5% q-o-q. Total deposits grew by 11% y-o-y and 5% q-o-q, driven by both CASA (up 6% q-o-q/ 4% y-o-y) and term deposits (up 17% y-o-y/ 4% q-o-q). Outlook We maintain a Buy rating with an unchanged PT of Rs. 1,120. We believe now in terms of ROA expansion levers from here on, only operating leverage can help, which could be partly offset by NIMs moderation. Thus, strong outperformance and further re-rating from here on is likely to be a very gradual one based on sustainable performance and quality earnings.

Good execution and good management - in a word, good people - are rare.” - Arthur Rock  It is advantage bulls at the start of the week after a strong set of quarterly numbers from index heavyweights ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries. Renewed selling by foreign institutional investors though is a dampener, bulls will be watching closely if Friday’s net sales of Rs 2,000 crore plus by overseas investors is a one-off or a harbinger of more selling to come.  Wipro  The company will consider a buyback of shares on Thursday. The stock could see a brief bump-up, but further gains will depend on the management commentary and guidance post-quarterly earnings. The stock appeared to be the comeback trail after rising almost fourfold from the pandemic lows between March 2020 and December 2021.    Since then, it has fallen much sharper than its peers (nearly 50 percent), so much so that it hardly finds a mention when frontline IT stocks are discussed. Wipro’s business growth over the last few quarters has been erratic compared to peers, but that appears to have largely been priced in. The big question is whether the company can surprise positively when the heavyweights of the industry are guarded in their outlook for the rest of the year.  ICICI Bank  For all the talk about net interest margins shrinking for the industry in general, ICICI Bank has proved naysayers wrong with a 20-basis point improvement quarter-on-quarter to 4.9 percent. Question is whether this is peak NIM and the market has factored it in the stock price. ICICI Bank is the most loved stock among analysts at this point and the strong fourth quarter numbers justify the popularity.  The bank has delivered strong numbers four quarters in a row now, but the stock has been in consolidation mode since November when it hit a peak of Rs 950. Since banks are a proxy of the economy, ICICI Bank’s numbers may to an extent assuage concerns about a slowdown in the economy.  There has been a flood of positive analyst calls after the numbers, and bulls are counting on the earnings and target price upgrades for a breakout on the upside soon enough. Goldman Sachs is among the few who are guarded in their optimism. The broker sees pre-provisioning profits slow down in FY24-FY25 and has taken the stock off its conviction list while maintaining a 'buy' call.  Macrotech Developers  The latest earnings report shows why the market was wary in greeting the developer’s March quarter business update. Revenues, operating profit and margins are down year-on-year. The 1:1 bonus issue should, however, keep the stock in play for the next couple of sessions. Analysts are not too enthused about the March quarter performance for high-end property developers in general, because the strong demand for luxury homes was mainly because of high net worth individuals try to avoid the new capital gains tax rules on property sales that kick in from March.  The Macrotech Developers stock is yet to fully recover from the hammering in March when the price fell by 20 percent. High interest rates and a slowing job market are the big concern for the sector right now  Retail investors mellow  US retail investors still love stocks, but not with the same passion as was seen in 2020 and 2021. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, there are growing signs that the investing euphoria of recent years has faded.  “Individuals are increasingly favoring diversified ETFs over single stocks, they are trading less actively, and by at least one measure, they are pulling back from the riskier options market.”  Nevertheless, experts say sustained healthy purchases from individuals is one of the reasons for the S&amp;amp;P 500 rising nearly 8 percent despite the banking turmoil and a looming recession.  Business (not) as usual?  The global narrative surrounding the surge in aviation and hospitality stocks has been largely centred on the resumption of business travel, which is considered a major pillar of the industry's recovery. But that story may be exaggerated. The days of high-flying, big-spending business travel may be over for good, reports CNBC.com, quoting a report by Morning Consult.  “Tighter corporate budgets and new ways of virtual working have permanently changed business travel, according to the report, titled “Business, but Not as Usual.” The report says the demographics are changing too — business travelers are now younger and more likely to fly in economy class, with about half earning less than $50,000 a year.”  Lithium wars  Chile is planning to nationalise its lithium industry, using a model where the state will partner with companies to enable local development, reports mining.com. Last year, Mexico had done the same. This trend may not be music to the ears of electric vehicle makers:  “Mexico is seeking to create a regional lithium association with Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, which has which has about 65 percent. of the world’s known resources of the metal. Argentina, Chile, Bolivia and Brazil, in turn, are exploring the creation of a lithium cartel of sorts in charge of expanding South America’s processing capacity.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/short-call-wipro-icici-bank-macrotech-developers-in-focus-retail-investors-a-wary-lot-in-us-10463331.html

Nirmal Bang  ICICI Bank reported strong 4QFY23 performance on the back of healthy credit growth, margin expansion and improvement in asset quality. The result was largely in-line with broking house estimates, with PAT growing by 30 percent YoY to Rs 91 billion.  Credit growth came in at 4.7 percent QoQ (18.7 percent YoY), driven by domestic credit book. NIM expansion was strong at 25bps QoQ and 90bps YoY to 4.9 percent and stood at a multi quarter high, leading to NII growth of 40.2 percent YoY (7.3 percent QoQ) to Rs 176.7 billion.  Core fee income growth was healthy at 10.6 percent YoY, while total non-interest income grew by 7.4 percent YoY, as it was impacted by a small treasury loss.  Nirmal Bang remain positive on ICICI Bank given its growth outlook and earnings trajectory with return ratios to remain in top quartile going forward.  It maintains 'buy' on ICICI Bank with a target price (TP) of Rs 1,154 (SOTP based).  JPMorgan  JPMorgan has been given an 'overweight' rating to the stock with a target of Rs 1,150 per share. The Q4 earnings were 7 percent higher than JPMorgan's estimates. The core pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) was driven by net interest margin (NIM) expansion and loan growth. Nearly all of the provisions made in the quarter were contingent in nature.  Ex-provisions, the core return on equity (ROE) would have been 21 percent. However, it is expected that NIMs have peaked. Despite this, the bank build-up enough buffer to support high-teens growth with stable return on assets (RoAs).  JPMorgan views ICICI Bank as a steady, low-risk compounding story that is likely to deliver a 16 percent consolidated EPS CAGR over the next two years with a 17 percent RoE.  Bernstein  Bernstein has given ICICI Bank an 'overweight' rating with a target of Rs 1,000 per share. The bank reported very strong Q4 results with EPS increasing by 30 percent YoY. The EPS growth at 36 percent higher, for the full year was also strong.  The EPS growth was largely led by the 31 percent growth in Net Interest Income (NII) and a decline in provision expenses. There was little to complain about this quarter, except a weak deposit growth relative to its larger peer.  CLSA  The broking firm has kept 'buy' rating on the stock and raised target of Rs 1,200 per share. The bank delivered an impeccable Q4, with core pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) growth driven by another 25 bps QoQ/19 percent YoY of NIM expansion. Management has indicated that it does not see any growth or deposit challenges.  The bank plans to use its high profitability phase to invest in more branches in FY24. Its RoRWA (return on risk-weighted assets) of 3.1-3.2% is best in class.  The earnings multiples of 14x/12x FY24/25CL are undemanding.  Jefferies   The research house has maintained the 'buy' rating with a target of Rs 1,180 per share. The bank's profits is ahead of estimates, aided by stronger net interest margins (NIMs). Asset quality was noted to remain robust, and 99 percent of credit costs were attributed to buffer-building.  Deposit growth was modest at 11 percent, while loans plus investments rose by 18 percent, as liquid assets and Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) fell. However, Jefferies expects to see an uptick in deposit mobilisation as a plus expect this to continue into FY24.  Jefferies has raised its earnings estimates by 5-9 percent.  Goldman Sachs   Goldman Sachs has kept the 'buy' rating on the stock with a target of Rs 1,100 per share.

icici,2023-04-21T19:59:10+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan,HDFC-HDFC Bank merger: Why RBI clarification comes as a relief for the banking giant,"More time to comply with PSL requirements takes away the immediate burden from the bank. Similarly, clarity on holdings in investments and subsidiaries will clear air for investors.","The country’s largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank, recently said that it has received some clarifications from the banking regulator with respect to its proposed merger with the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC). These clarifications were given after the bank sought certain relaxations from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to make the process of merger smooth. The merger is expected to take effect by July this year.  A quick look at the clarifications shows HDFC Bank has received relief in certain major areas. The biggest relief is in relation to the priority sector lending (PSL) norms. Under the rules, a banking entity needs to lend 40 percent of the adjusted net bank credit to the so-called priority sector or economically weaker sections such as agriculture, micro-enterprises and other economically weaker sections.  If HDFC Bank (the combined entity) had to meet this on day 1 of the merger, it would have been a big jolt. But now, the RBI has clarified that HDFC Bank can calculate the adjusted net bank credit considering one-third of the outstanding loans of HDFC Limited as on the effective date of the amalgamation for the first year.  The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio of HDFC Limited can be considered over a period of the next two years equally, the RBI said. This means HDFC Bank will have around three years to comply with PSL norms. In fact, the PSL requirement kicks in only 12 months after the effective date of the merger, according to the bank.  In short, this will be a significant reduction in cost. The second big clarification is on the treatment of investments in subsidiaries. Investors were worried that the bank may be asked to cut stakes in key subsidiaries such as HDFC Life. Here, the RBI has clarified that investments including subsidiaries and associates of HDFC Limited are allowed to continue as investments of HDFC Bank.  The RBI has permitted HDFC Bank or HDFC Limited to increase the shareholding to more than 50 percent in HDFC Life Insurance Company and HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company. This is another major good news for the bank and investors. HDFC, as on March 2023, already has 49 percent stake in HDFC Life.  The parent company had earlier held a majority stake in HDFC Life at 50.14 percent in September 2020. To comply with RBI guidelines of 50 percent limit, the stake was cut to 49.99 percent in December 2020, 49.88 in December 2021 and to 48.65 percent in March 2023. Logically, the bank can now hike the stake in HDFC Life to over 50 percent, which may happen eventually.  Further, the RBI has permitted HDFC Bank to continue holding HDFC’s stake in HDFC Education and Development Services Private Limited, engaged in operating three education schools, for a period of two years from the effective date and HDFC Credila Financial Services Limited, subject to the shareholding being brought down to 10 percent within two years from the effective date.  In simple terms, what this all means is that HDFC Bank, post its merger, will get close control of all subsidiaries much like its rival conglomerates like ICICI Bank. One of the major concerns of investors in the run-up to the merger was the likely treatment of subsidiaries. With the RBI clarification, that worry is gone.  The not-so-good part of the clarification is that all the mandatory reserve requirements such as CRR (cash reserve ratio), SLR (statutory liquidity ratio) and LCR (liquidity coverage ratio) will be set in on the first day of the merger. But, considering the larger reliefs on PSL and subsidiary treatment, this will likely be a lesser worry for the combined entity.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hdfc-hdfc-bank-merger-why-rbi-clarification-is-a-relief-for-the-banking-major-10455141.html

","Despite the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) indicating its readiness to raise the rates again, following a pause in April, Rohit Srivastava, the founder and market strategist at indiacharts.com, predicts that the central bank will hold rates at the current level for a longer period.  Srivastava said the market was anticipating a 25-basis-point hike, but recent actions by central banks around the world suggest that they may be taking cues from falling bond yields and moving towards a pause.  Rohit Srivastava was speaking with Nandita Khemka and N Mahalaxmi on Thursday after the RBI policy.  The RBI must, however, exercise caution in its statement, as inflation has not fully cooled off yet, even though the trajectory appears to be lower. Therefore, the RBI will likely maintain caution until they see that the job is truly done, Srivastava said.  &quot;Australia and Poland have already done so, and there was speculation that the RBI may follow suit, as reflected in bond yields breaking below 7.3 percent yesterday. Today's break confirms this trend, which is likely to persist for several months. Nevertheless, the bond market is leading the way this time and indicating that interest rates will be lower,&quot; Srivastava said.  The RBI on April 6 decided to keep the repo rate unchanged, considering the chaos caused by the US banking crisis and amid fears of a contagion. The central bank maintained its 'withdrawal of accommodation' stance and emphasised its preparedness to take action if necessary, adding that the policy decision was a ‘pause, not a pivot’.  The Indian bond yield market cheered the RBI policy announcement. The 10-year bond yield fell 6 bps to close at 7.204 percent from previous close of 7.267 percent, the 5-year bond yield ended at 7.008 percent, down 13 bps from previous close of 7.142 percent, while one-year bond yield lost 23 bps to close at 6.896 percent from previous close of 7.122 percent.  On April 4, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) opted to maintain the interest rate at 3.6 percent. In his speech discussing the policy outlook, RBA Governor Philip Lowe explained that the decision to keep rates steady this month was made to provide additional time for evaluating the effects of past hikes. However, the Board plans to reassess the policy in May, taking into account the latest economic and inflation forecasts.  On April 5, Poland's central bank decided to maintain its current interest rates at 6.75 percent. However, it expressed concerns over the heightened uncertainty surrounding the global economy, owing to the ongoing turmoil in the banking sector in the US and Europe. The bank noted that the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank are still increasing the rates.  Srivastava said the pause in interest rates is positive for rate-sensitive sectors. Nifty Realty Index jumped nearly 3 percent while Nifty Auto advanced 1 percent post RBI policy decision.  Four-wheeler stocks are showing comparatively stronger performance than their two-wheeler peers, with the former holding up relatively better while the latter facing significant declines. Momentum investing, which involves chasing previous high-performing stocks, favours 4-wheeler stocks over 2-wheelers. If this trend persists, a portfolio manager may not switch from 4-wheelers to 2-wheelers unless there is a change in performance, he added.  Srivastava said there is a general trend of relative strength, with ICICI Bank standing out as a top performer compared to other banks. This is significant because the bank had been in a prolonged underperformance phase, indicating a meaningful shift. When choosing among private banks, the preferred approach is to select the one that has shown the strongest performance over the recent period.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/rbi-likely-to-maintain-pause-on-rate-hikes-for-longer-says-indiacharts-rohit-srivastava-10387161.html
icici,2023-04-06T16:15:01+05:30,Nickey Mirchandani,"Why Gautam Duggad of Motilal Oswal Finance thinks BFSI, auto will drive Q4 earnings growth","Consumer and IT sectors are expected to clock decent growth, while metals and cement are expected to be top laggards, he said. As far as new-age companies are concerned, valuations are still quite expensive. They are still not showing consistent profitability and the market caps are quite high, Duggad said.","Nifty50 is estimated to see a healthy 14 percent earnings growth for Q4FY23 despite a challenging global context, marked by a banking crisis in the West, macro slowdown in India, and FII outflows, said Gautam Duggad, Head of Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Service Ltd (MOFSL), in an exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol.  This growth is led by just two sectors, financials and auto. Within these sectors, a few heavyweight stocks like SBI, ICICI Bank, Tata Motors, and ONGC are doing the work.  Duggad expects earnings growth to be fuelled by the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and auto sectors, which are likely to rise 37 percent and 70 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, respectively.  Similarly, within Nifty, SBI, ICICI Bank, ONGC, Tata Motors, and BPCL are likely to contribute 82 percent to the incremental YoY accretion in earnings, he said.  He said that a narrow growth focus has led to a 1.5-2 percent earnings downgrade for FY24 and FY25, with the EPS revised down from 990-odd levels to 978. This growth is expected to face volatility in the coming months.  Edited excerpts:  India Inc will soon report earnings for the final quarter of FY23, which has been rather volatile. Which segments do you think will do well? What kind of earnings growth can we look at from those sectors?  For the quarter, we put out our strategy note just last evening. What we are estimating is about 14 percent earnings growth for Nifty and 15 percent for our coverage universe, which is 230-odd stocks.  This is quite healthy, I would say, given the context that we are going through. There is a banking crisis in the West. Interest rates have gone up, and there is a macro slowdown in India also, wherein we had just about 4.5 percent GDP growth last quarter. So the context is quite challenging. And of course, we are also seeing a lot of FII outflows over the last three months.  Given that context, for the first nine months, we had seen about a 12-13 percent earnings score for the Nifty. This quarter, we see it at 14 percent. So, basically, we will lend somewhere about 14 percent for FY23, which is very healthy because it is coming on a very high base of 38 percent growth, which Nifty earnings saw in FY22.  The only sore point is it is very narrow and led by the same two sectors. This time again, it is financials which are doing the heavy lifting. The auto sector is joining. So, financials account for 70 percent of the incremental growth that we're talking about, and auto about 20 percent growth in MOFSL's universe.  Between financials and auto, you're seeing 90 percent of the incremental earnings growth. There are 4-5 heavyweight stocks which are driving 82 percent of incremental Nifty earnings, YoY, for Q4FY23 -- stocks like SBI, ICICI Bank, Tata Motors and ONGC.  These stocks typically command a lower PE and are driving the bulk of the growth for the quarter. So it is very skewed and very narrow, led by a few stocks. Even within that, a few heavyweight stocks are doing the trick. Outside of banking and auto, we are seeing decent growth in consumer and IT, at about 10-11 percent.  On the downside, you have metals, which are declining at 35 percent, which is quite big actually, that we saw even in the third quarter. Cement is also declining at about 8-9 percent. So, net-net, you're talking about a 14-15 percent earnings growth, but led by a few sectors and very narrow in that sense.  Our forward earnings revision is also a bit muted. We are seeing a 1.5-2 percent earnings downgrade for FY24 and FY25. So, for the next year, the EPS stands revised down from 990-odd levels to 978. That will still be a 20 percent growth, but that growth can change quite significantly in the next couple of months as we go through this period of heightened volatility.  I'm just going to place the focus right now on new-age companies. That’s where the reality check has come in, right? Today, there was a Q4 update coming in even for Nykaa. Do you think Q4 would be a complete wash-out quarter for new-age companies?  We don't cover any of these new-age digital names. We were not comfortable with valuations last year. So, we still don't have coverage. Of course, prices have corrected 50-70 percent. Depending on which stock you talk about, prices have corrected 50-70 percent from the top.  Business-wise, some of them are very dominant in their respective domains, whether it is Zomato or Paytm or Delhivery or even Nykaa for that matter. Specific to Nykaa, while we don't have coverage, I think the segment, discretionary consumption segment, has been going through a bit of moderation in the last 2-3 quarters.  And it's not just specific to Nykaa. Even if you look at the old-age companies, for want of a better word, they are also going through a bit of a slowdown, whether it is QSR, retail, or staples. DMart's update came in yesterday. A large part of the growth is driven by store addition. So it's quite a well-spread slowdown in the consumption segment. Only very few companies are bucking that trend.  So, I don't want to pick out one company and say there is a problem there. Problems are across the board in the consumption space. As far as some of these new-age companies are concerned, they have corrected in terms of price. Valuations are still quite expensive, in my view, given that they are still not showing consistent profitability and the market caps are still quite high.  So while one might get tempted, given the extent and magnitude of price correction, you have to keep an eye on the underlying valuations, because the context has changed. You've seen a 300 basis point kind of interest rate hike, almost. If I factor in today's potential 25 basis point hike, it's 275, almost 300 basis point rate hike. So, the context for equity valuations has clearly changed, and therefore, the same set of cash flows two years back was attracting different multiples.  Today, they will attract a very different sort of multiples, which is what played out, to an extent, in the last 14-15 months, and it can continue in the near term as well. So, you'll have to take a dispassionate view while looking at some of these companies.  Let’s touch base on the financial space. The RBI’s monetary policy committee decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent on Thursday. For the entire financial year, we've seen good performance from PSU banks. How do you think the performance is going to be now?  On financials, we've been very clear that the fundamental performance has been the strongest in the last 15 years. When we look at the trajectory of the profit over the last five years, the profits of financials belonging to the Nifty index are five times in five years.  There are 11 companies in the Nifty, which belong to the BFSI domain. Profits are up from Rs 45,000 crore in 2018 to about Rs 2.1 lakh crore in 2023. You have seen credit growth pick up in the last year. Margins are almost at their peak so they might see a 20-30 basis point decline.  You've seen the quarter-end updates from most of the financial companies. At least 10-11 companies have put out their quarterly updates. Across the board, you have seen very strong credit and deposit growth. Banks like HDFC Bank have collected deposits to the tune of Rs 1 .5 lakh crore in the quarter that has gone by. This is outstanding, right?  You've seen very strong growth from IndusInd Bank and some of the other names like Bajaj Finance and Mahindra Finance, which have put out their updates. Fundamentally, there seem to be no issues there. In fact, even on this high base, for the next two years, we are expecting earnings to compound at 20 percent.  So, we are expecting the profits of financials alone to reach Rs 3 lakh crore in Nifty in FY25, right? Till about four years back, that used to be the number for the entire Nifty. About Rs 3-3.5 lakh crore was the profit number for FY19 and for FY20 also.  That is the journey financials have travelled in the last 4-5 years. Coming to stock performance, it's a very different ball game altogether. It's dependent on many things. More importantly, FII flows have been very challenging. In fact, we've seen outflows in the last 2-3 months. The March number, obviously, gets a bit distorted because of one particular trade, which happened at the beginning of the month. Otherwise, in January, February and March 2023, and in the entire CY22, you've seen FII outflows.  Financials are a large part of the FII portfolios, about 37-38 percent. So it's quite natural that when you see an outflow in that segment, financials will build the brand. When you compare it to a price value equation [inaudible], the valuations are looking extremely attractive.  Banks, which are trading at 4-4.5 times, are today available at 2.5-2.6 times, while their ROEs have increased to about 17-18 percent. The provision coverage ratios are 85-95 percent. So, it's a matter of time before the underlying stock price movement or market cap movement catches up with earnings.  In between, you will always see a lot of turbulence because it's a macro sector, at the end of the day. Right now, we are going through a lot of turbulence at the macro level. So macro is right now overwhelming the micro as far as financials are concerned. So, yeah, it's a game of patience and waiting.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bfsi-auto-space-to-drive-q4fy23-earnings-growth-guatam-duggad-of-motilal-oswal-finance-10373841.html
icici,2023-04-06T15:45:09+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Ten stocks gear up to deliver up to 15% returns as RBI slams brakes on rate hikes,"With the rate pause, there will be some respite for large debt companies, growth stocks, small and mid-cap space companies, and specific sectors like consumer durables and real estate in the medium term","The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India has decided to retain the repo rate at 6.5 percent with a 5:1 majority focussing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth.  The total repo rate hike by the RBI since May 2022 was 250 basis points with the objective of bringing inflation down to its target of 4 percent (+/- 2 percent).  Some experts expected one last rate hike of 25 bps, while others had forecast a long pause to assess the impact of earlier rate hikes on growth.  “This is in line with our expectations and possibly a best-case scenario and positive for the markets. The RBI has remained prudent as it evaluates the comprehensive effect of rate hikes that we saw over the last year,” said Divam Sharma, founder of Green Portfolio PMS.  Food inflation is a matter of grave concern for the RBI and it is willing to bend over backwards to slow inflation and get it back to the tolerance band, he said.  The RBI raised its growth forecast to 6.5 percent from 6.4 percent earlier, while the inflation forecast for the current financial year was lowered to 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent earlier, assuming an annual average crude oil price (Indian basket) of $85 per barrel and a normal monsoon.  But it feels the lag in the passthrough of input costs could keep core inflation elevated. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 6.44 percent in February compared with 6.52 percent in the previous month.  Anil Rego, founder of Right Horizons PMS, said the unchanged stance signals that the RBI is confident of its projections and expects inflation to cool gradually.  Hence, Divam said there will be some respite for large debt companies, growth stocks, small and mid-cap space companies, and specific sectors like consumer durables and real estate in the medium term, thanks to the RBI’s decision to not hike rates.  The benchmark stock indices extended their upward journey for the fifth consecutive session amid volatility, with the BSE Sensex rising almost 52 points to 59,741 levels and the Nifty 50 climbing 19 points to 17,576 levels, at 14:01 hours IST.  Here is a list of rate-sensitive stocks that experts said can return up to 15 percent in the short term. The returns are based on the closing prices of April 5.  Expert: Viraj Vyas, technical &amp;amp; derivatives analyst, institutional equity, at Ashika Stock Broking  AAVAS Financiers: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,672 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,580 | Target: Rs 1,900 | Return: 14 percent  The stock has been languishing since January 2022 and is trading in a falling wedge pattern. Usually, this is a reversal pattern (bullish in this context). The RSI (relative strength index) has given a positive divergence, as highlighted in the chart.  Although there is no strength now, the stock presents a low-risk-high-reward probability. After crossing Rs 1,730, some bullishness can push the stock towards Rs 1,900.  ICICI Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 885 | Stop-Loss: Rs 840 | Target: Rs 980 | Return: 11 percent  The stock has endured a corrective leg from November 2022 and although it broke away from the falling trendline, the stock has not witnessed any follow-through beyond the Rs 880-875 zone.  Also read: MPC keeps repo rate unchanged, raises GDP growth forecast: 10 key takeaways  The stock is consolidating in a narrow range of Rs 815-875 and a sustained breakout above Rs 880 is likely to inspire a move towards Rs 940-920.  Recent volume activity too shows stronger buyer interest near the breakout, making a high probability bullish setup provided it sustains above Rs 840-850.    AU Small Finance Bank: Sell | LTP: Rs 558 | Stop-Loss: Rs 585 | Target: Rs 540 | Return: 3 percent  The stock has broadly consolidated time- and price-wise since August 2021 and until recently, started forming lower highs and lower lows, breaking below the trendline around the Rs 600 mark.  The stock since then has headed towards Rs 585 and beyond, which shows bearish intent. On the RSI indicator, the stock is at 36, which denotes that it has been forming more lower lows and is in a bearish grip.    Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities  ICICI Lombard General Insurance: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,093 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,049 | Target: Rs 1,178 | Return: 8 percent  In mid-March, the stock registered a new 52-week low of Rs 1,049 and moved sideways thereafter. A bullish divergence in short-term indicators signals that the stock may bounce back, utilising the prior consolidation.  On the higher side, the stock may face a hurdle at around its prior point of polarity (Rs 1,116). As per the current set-up, the stock may surpass that hurdle easily and could move towards its 200-day SMA (simple moving average) of Rs 1,178.  In case of a decline, the stock will find support around its 52-week low.    Muthoot Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 990 | Stop Loss: Rs 940 | Target: Rs 1,100 | Return: 11 percent  After a falling channel breakout, the stock retested its extended upper band and resumed the up-move. Continuing its prior daily rising trend, the stock rose to a one-and-half-month closing high on April 5.  Key technical indicators are in favour of the bulls in the medium term as well as the short-term timeframe charts.  The stock has the potential to move towards its 200-day SMA of Rs 1,039 initially and the psychological level of Rs 1,100 subsequently.  On the lower side, the stock may respect the extended upper band of the channel.    PFC: Buy | LTP: Rs 157 | Stop Loss: Rs 149 | Target: Rs 172 | Return: 10 percent  In the last week, the stock respected its upward sloping 20-week EMA (exponential moving average) and breached its prior falling trend. Later, the stock extended gains and rose to a 12-day closing high.  The positive momentum may continue, which could lead the stock towards its long-term hurdle zone of Rs 168-172. The key technical indicators reversed from the oversold zone and gave buy signals.  In case of any decline, the stock may find intermediate support at around its 50-day EMA, which is currently Rs 150.    Expert: Rohan Shah, Head of Technical Analyst at Stoxbox  ICICI Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 885 | Stop-Loss: Rs 854 | Target: Rs 955 | Return: 8 percent  The stock plunged about 16 percent from a life high, declining from Rs 958 to Rs 796 in late January, after which it traded in a tight range. In this process, the stock recently witnessed a potential breakout from the Master Candle Pattern, with the price moving above the 20-week EMA after a good amount of time, highlighting a bullish momentum.  Also, the price decline was arrested at around its previous resistance level, which denotes polarity into play and highlights a robust price structure. Momentum indicator RSI has surpassed 50 levels with a bullish crossover, validating the bullish bias in the price.  Thes stock has the potential to scale higher towards Rs 930, followed by Rs 955, with a protective stop-loss of Rs 854.    Aditya Birla Capital: Buy | LTP: Rs 155 | Stop-Loss: Rs 146 | Target: Rs 173 | Return: 12 percent  The pattern analysis on the weekly charts exhibits a stage-2 breakout, followed by a potential base in the making. It witnessed a shakeout during the base formation and continued to hover above the breakout zone, which evinces another modest accumulation at elevated levels.  The accumulation base forming a potential Darvas box is captivating, while it trades a hair's breadth away from the ceiling near Rs 162.45.  It also shows a strong relative performance compared to the head index, which showcases further strength in the price action. We anticipate a potential upside till Rs 173 against a stop-loss of Rs 146.    Bajaj Finance: Sell | LTP: Rs 5,761 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,000 | Target: Rs 4,920 | Return: 15 percent  The stock has been under pressure for many weeks, and the price has tumbled more than 25 percent since its September 2022 highs. On the price pattern front, the stock has registered a breakdown from a contracting triangle pattern, which denotes that the dominance of bears is likely to persist.  The stock has been trading below all key daily moving averages (20, 50, 100, 200), which indicates a bearish trend and lack of strength. For the past couple of weeks, the price has been consolidating at a 38.2 percent retracement level (Rs 5,650) from its prior advance from Rs 1,783 to Rs 8,050.  We sense another round of selloff once the price decisively trades below Rs 5,650. Going ahead, if the price trades below the mentioned levels, it will open the way for Rs 5,335 and Rs 4,920, with a stop-loss of Rs 6,000.    Expert: Rupak De, Senior Technical analyst at LKP Securities  HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,654 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,615 | Target: Rs 1,725-1,776 | Return: 7 percent  The stock has given a swing high breakout on the daily chart, suggesting a rise in bullish bets. Besides, the stock has moved above the critical moving average on the daily timeframe.  The momentum oscillator RSI (14) is in a bullish crossover. Over the short term, the stock is likely to move towards a higher level. On the higher end, resistance is visible at Rs 1,725, above which further upside movement can happen. On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 1,615.    Tata Motors: Buy | LTP: Rs 427 | Stop-Loss: Rs 417 | Target: Rs 445-460 | Return: 8 percent  The stock has given a falling trendline breakout on the daily chart, suggesting a rise in optimism. Besides, the stock has moved above the 200 DMA, which points towards a positive trend.  The momentum indicator is in a bullish crossover. Over the short term, the stock is likely to move towards Rs 460. On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 417.

The stock was trading a almost percent higher in the afternoon trade on March 27.  CLSA analysts have left the target price unchanged at Rs 2,080 a share, implying an upside of 23 percent. Its valuation premium to HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank is down 10-20 percent. &quot;Discounting the CEO transition, some premium to peers is justified,&quot; they said.  With just 2 percent market share and a formidable banking franchise, they expect Kotak to be the bank leader among large banks.  &quot;Kotak Mahindra Bank's liability granularity has also improved with the low cost of fund gaps,&quot; the report added. Loan growth has picked up over the last 18 months to +20 percent driven by a higher willingness of management to lend, which allows Kotak to compete in segments like mortgages.  In Q3 FY23, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd beat Street estimates with a 31 percent growth in net profit at Rs 2,792 crore. The bank's net interest income surged 30 percent to Rs 5,653 crore, on the back of a year-on-year growth of 23 percent in loans and a jump in net interest margin to 5.47 percent from 4.62 percent.

icici,2023-03-13T11:33:33+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Trading in times of correction: Top 10 ideas from experts for next 3-4 weeks,"The 17,300 level is expected to act as a crucial support, followed by the recent swing low of 17,250 and, if the said levels get broken, then there could be correction up to the 17,000 mark","A spate of corrections sweeping through global markets after worries intensified in the US banking space weighed on the Indian equity markets on March 10, driving the Nifty50 down 1 percent on Friday as well as in the entire last week.  The index managed to defend not only 17,300 but also the 17,400 levels, and closed at 17,413 on Friday, the lowest closing level since March 2. There was formation of a bearish candlestick pattern which somewhat resembles a bearish engulfing pattern on the weekly timeframe, indicating the possibility of weakness going ahead, though there was a hammer kind of pattern formation on the daily scale on Friday, which is generally a bullish reversal pattern.  The 17,300 level is expected to act as a crucial support, followed by the recent swing low of 17,250 and if the said levels get broken, then there could be correction up to the 17,000 mark, whereas on the higher side, 17,600-17,700 could be critical hurdles for further up-move towards the psychological 18,000 mark, experts said.  &quot;Friday's low around 17,320 would be seen as an immediate support followed by sacrosanct support at February's swing low of 17,250. On the flip side, the bearish gap left around 17,570–17,600 should be considered an immediate hurdle,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.  Instead of swaying on both sides of the trend, he advised that traders should ideally prefer staying light on positions and keep accumulating quality propositions in a staggered manner.  The weak global cues and underperforming heavyweights, especially Reliance Industries, were major culprits in dragging the markets down. Going ahead, it would be crucial to keep a close tab on them as any positive development globally can elevate the overall sentiment, Sameet Chavan said.  Ajit Mishra, VP - Technical Research at Religare Broking said that while most of the sectors are trading in line with the benchmark, the performance of banking and financials would continue to play a key role in deciding the next directional move. Stay focused on stock selection and risk management, he advised.  Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the March 10 closing prices:  Expert: Viraj Vyas, Technical &amp;amp; Derivatives Analyst - Institutional Equity at Ashika Stock Broking  Linde India: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,015 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,800 | Target: Rs 4,450 | Return: 11 percent  The stock has been forming an ascending triangle pattern since April last year and broke out with volumes in the last few sessions. Post the strong breakout, the stock opened gap up and despite ongoing volatility, the stock continues to sustain higher which indicates buyer Strength.  Post such an extended consolidation breakout, the stock appears to have a price objective of atleast of 1,000 rupees rally from the breakout level which provides a favourable risk-reward opportunity.    GAIL India: Buy | LTP: Rs 111 | Stop-Loss: Rs 103 | Target: Rs 125 | Return: 13 percent  The oil and gas space is a sector which has been in a broader consolidation since almost 2 years with bouts of strengths and weakness.  Looking at weekly chart, the stock has closed at the higher threshold of the consolidation of almost 2 years. The breakout was assisted with strong volumes and such breakout after elongated consolidation usually results in sharp up move.    NCC: Buy | LTP: Rs 99 | Stop-Loss: Rs 90 | Target: Rs 120 | Return: 21 percent  The weekly chart of the strong depicts a Cup and Handle pattern formed over a period of around 4 years which depicts massive accumulation.  The stock has also closed above the previous swing high (Rs 95-level) which indicates seller exhaustion. The stock broke above the neckline last week with above average volume and continues to be resilient in turbulent market which depicts buyer strength.    Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  Persistent Systems: Sell | LTP: Rs 4,749 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,000 | Target: Rs 4,400 | Return: 7 percent  The stock is diverging negatively on the daily charts. During the pullback trend, the stock managed to surpass its previous peak, however, the key oscillators failed to gain momentum. Such a type of formation invites correction.  The strategy should be to sell at the current level of Rs 4,750 and the rest at Rs 4,900. For that put the stop-loss at Rs 5,000. On the downside, the stock may slide towards Rs 4,500 &amp;amp; Rs 4,400 levels.    ICICI Bank: Sell | LTP: Rs 843 | Stop-Loss: Rs 855 | Target: Rs 800 | Return: percent  The stock is forming an ascending triangle, which is a bullish consolidation for the stock, however, it has broken its support due to sudden weakness in the market. It is suggesting a correction in the near term.  In such cases most of the time the stock falls to the starting point of the formation which is at Rs 800. The stock may fall down 5 percent from the current levels, which is a decent downside. Sell is recommended at current levels and above Rs 850. For this, keep the stop-loss at Rs 855.    Tata Steel: Buy | LTP: Rs 108 | Stop-Loss: Rs 100 | Target: Rs 125 | Return: 16 percent  It is making a higher bottom at Rs 103.50 as compared to Rs 100, which was its previous low. The entire basket of steel stocks reversed sharply in the past week.  In fact, for the past two weeks, the stock has been facing buying pressure whenever it has declined. It is relatively outperforming other sectors and also stocks from the metal baskets.  A buy is recommended at current levels and at Rs 104. For that, keep a stop-loss at Rs 100. On the upside, it has the potential to move higher towards Rs 115 or Rs 125 in the medium term.    Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities  RBL Bank March Future: Sell | LTP: Rs 155.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 165 | Target: Rs 143 | Return: 8 percent  After witnessing a sharp weakness in January month, the stock price has shifted into a broader high low range movement within Rs 170-150 levels. Presently, the stock price is placed at the edge of breaking below the crucial lower support at Rs 150 levels-weekly 20-period EMA (exponential moving average).  The overall chart pattern indicates a formation of important top at Rs 189 in January month and there is a higher chance of further weakness emerging in coming week.  Volume has started to expand during downside breakout in the stock price and weekly 14 period RSI (relative strength index) shows negative indication. Hence, one may expect further strengthening of downside momentum in the stock price ahead.  One may look to create short position in RBL Bank March Future at CMP (Rs 155.10), add more on rise up to Rs 161, wait for the downside target of Rs 143 in the next 2 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 165.    Oracle Financial Services Software: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,242 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,025 | Target: Rs 3,480 | Return: 7 percent  The attached weekly timeframe chart of the IT stock - Oracle Financial Services Software (OFSS) indicates a sustainable upside bounce in the last few weeks.  We observe a formation broader triangle pattern (converging up and down trend lines), which is unfolding over the last few months.  The stock price is now in an attempt of upside breakout of the triangle at Rs 3,230-3,250 levels. Hence, a sustainable move above this hurdle is expected to bring strong upside momentum for the stock price ahead.  The negative chart pattern like lower tops and bottoms (during November 21 to October 22) seems to have been completed as per weekly chart and the stock price has started to move up as per the positive pattern like higher tops and bottoms recently. This is positive indication.  One may look to buy OFSS at CMP (Rs 3,245), add more on dips down to Rs 3,120 and wait for the upside target of Rs 3,480 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 3,025.    Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com  Hindustan Petroleum Corporation: Buy | LTP: Rs 230 | Stop-Loss: Rs 222 | Target: Rs 244 | Return: 6 percent  The stock witnessed a buying interest in the week gone by and showed a relative outperformance in last couple of sessions inspite of selling pressure seen in the broader markets.  The RSI oscillator has given a positive crossover indicating a positive momentum while the prices have also surpassed its ’20 DEMA’ hurdle.  We expect the momentum to continue in the near term and hence, traders can buy the stock in the range of Rs 227-230 for potential short term targets of Rs 238 and Rs 244. The stop-loss on long positions should be placed below Rs 222.  Polycab India: Sell | LTP: Rs 2,947 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,050 | Target: Rs 2,840 | Return: Rs 4 percent  The stock has seen a decent upmove in last couple of months and the momentum readings were in the overbought zone. In Friday's session, the prices breached its ‘20 DEMA’ support and the RSI oscillator also gave a negative crossover.  The volumes were also relatively good along with the price correction and hence, the stock could see further correction in the short term.  Traders are advised to sell the stock on pullback moves around Rs 2,980-3,000 for potential near term targets of Rs 2,900 and Rs 2,840. The stop-loss for short positions should be placed above Rs 3,050.

Around 24 banks have together lent money to GTL that include Canara Bank, Dena Bank and ICICI Bank among others.","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a case against GTL Ltd, some unknown bankers and directors for allegedly defrauding a consortium of banks for an amount to the tune of Rs 4,760 crore by creating an array of shell firms to divert  bank money.  As per the central probe agency, the company fraudulently obtained loans from a bank consortium of around 24 lenders and subsequently siphoned off majority of the loan amount in conspiracy with vendors and some bank officials.  Enquiries revealed that GTL was extending advances to vendors year on year without supply of material and goods. And eventually these advances were provisioned, the agency said. Moneycontrol has reviewed the copy of the First Information Report (FIR).  To facilitate the fraud, the perpetrators allegedly created various vendor companies in connivance with GTL Ltd, the CBI said. Among the banks, ICICI Bank has an exposure of Rs 650 crore to GTL Ltd, Bank of India Rs 467 crore and Canara Bank has Rs 412 crore.  The company obtained short term loan amounts for certain business activities by misrepresentation that all such loan amount will be utilised for the purpose of the said purpose. But soon after disbursement, majority of the loan amount was not utilised for the purpose for which it was granted, the CBI said.  “Thus, M/s. GTL Limited cheated the lenders and thereafter misappropriated the funds of the lenders,’ the agency said in its first information report.  Started in 1987 by Manoj Tirodkar of Global group, GTL is engaged in the business of providing telecom network deployment services, operations and maintenance services to telecom operators in India and international markets.   How the fraud was perpetrated   According to the probe agency, the GTL fraud happened in the following manner.  To begin with, huge advances were given to the purported vendors and substantial amount of such advance payments were routed back to GTL Ltd by the vendor entities after appropriating for purported marginal supply by the vendors.  Secondly, working capital funds were also used by GTL for buying fixed assets from vendors. The company allegedly made investments in various companies in purchasing their shares, the CBI said.  The lenders have disbursed Rs 1,055 crore and Rs 1,970 crore in financial year 2009-10 and 2010-11, respectively. Out of this loan amount, Rs 649 crore was invested in short-term mutual funds in FY 2009-10 and Rs 1,095 crore in FY 2010-11 immediately upon disbursement, CBI said.  Further Rs 135 crore were invested in fixed deposits immediately upon disbursement in FY 2010-11. “The company has availed sale bill discounting of Rs 3,01,08 crore (Fy 2009-10) and Rs 5,06,27 crore (FY 2010-11), out of which substantial amount has been invested in Liquid Mutual fund,” the CBI said in its FIR.  Huge advances given to vendor firms  CBI investigation revealed that an amount of Rs 1,21,397 crore is outstanding against the following four vendors - namely Acuity Trading Pvt Ltd, Lenity Trading Pvt ltd, Venerate Trading Pvt Ltd and Vinamara Multitrading Pvt Ltd.  GTL extended an advance of Rs 741.37 crore for supply of material to Acuity Trading Pvt Ltd, Rs 763. 59 crore to Lenity Trading Pvt Ltd, Rs 868.35 crore to Venerate Trading Pvt Ltd and Rs 816.04 crore to Vinamara Multitrading Pvt Ltd from financial year 2009-10 to 2011-12.  And against these huge advances, these four vendors supplied material of Rs. 109.74 crore, Rs 101. 09 crore, Rs 70.2 crore and Rs 103.44 crore, respectively. &quot;Eventually, Rs 1,213.97 crore was left outstanding towards these four vendors which was gradually provisioned till 2017 - 18,&quot; the CBI said.  According to investigators, these advances were given to vendors despite their meager net worth and their recent incorporation. The enquiry further revealed that all these vendor companies were incorporated within a short span of less than three months.  &quot;And the Memorandum of Association (MoA) of these vendors of GTL Limited is exactly same.  There are same corrections in all the MoA's which clearly establishes that all the MoA's have been drafted by the same agency/ source,&quot; the CBI said.  Further, advances were given by GTL to vendors to the tune of Rs 2,113.76 crore in financial year 2009-10 against which material received was only of Rs 65.33 crore, the CBI said.  Despite the non-receipt of goods against advances given, again in financial year 2010-11, GRTL advanced another Rs 4,438.20 crore to the same set 0f entities against which material received was only of Rs 708.70 crore.  Again, advances of Rs 256.16 crore were given in financial year 2011-12 and nothing was received against this advance. &quot;Therefore, the enquiries have established that these vendor companies were not supplying the goods commensurate with the advances given and despite that these were further receiving advances from GTL Limited year after year,&quot; the CBI said.  RBI red flag ignored?  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in its letter dated April 1, 2016 advised lDBI Bank, one of the lenders to GTL, to red flag GTL and initiate forensic audit. But two months later, lDBl Bank responded on behalf of the consortium saying not to classify the account as red flag and also not to appoint a forensic auditor as it may delay the dues settlement, the CBI FIR shows.  Enquiry further revealed that RBI in its letter dated 15 July, 2016 again directed IDBl Bank to comply with the directions of its earlier letter. Accordingly NBS and Co., Chartered Accountant was appointed to conduct the forensic audit of GTL Ltd.  IDBI Bank could not be immediately reached for comments for this story.  The audit revealed major irregularities including 'much lesser' purchases from vendors against the higher advance amounts extended. Essentially, a sizeable portion of the advance money was routed back to GTL by vendor firms amounting to fraud, the CBI said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rs-4760-crore-bank-fraud-cbi-registers-case-against-gtl-infra-directors-bankers-9943001.html

Unlike other banks, ICICI continues to build contingent buffer (Rs15bn in 3Q, taking it to Rs115bn/1.1% of loans) to smoothen its profitability trajectory and help absorb any futuristic asset-quality hiccups. Credit growth moderated a bit as the overseas book declined but remained healthy at 20% yoy/4% qoq. However, deposit growth lagged at 10% yoy, leading to higher LDR. This coupled with asset re-pricing and favorable loan composition boosted margins to an alltime high of 4.65%, up 34 bps qoq /69bps yoy. We believe margins have peaked and should ease a bit as funding cost catches up. We believe ICICI is best placed among large PVBs to deliver growth and absorb any macro/asset-quality shock, given healthy provisions/capital buffers. Thus, we expect the bank to deliver the best-ever RoA/RoE of 2.1-2.2%/17-18% over FY23-25E because of strong margins and lower LLP.  Outlook ICICI remains our top pick in the banking space, given its superior financial performance, top-management stability/credibility, and strong capital/provision buffers.

Net slippages continued to remain benign (+0.5% annualised); however, the bank further shored up its contingent provisions, taking the stock of contingent provisions prudently to 130bps. Given the benign credit cycle, we believe that the bank is currently witnessing a profitability overshoot, which is difficult to sustain. With deposit mobilisation lagging loan growth and timing differences in repricing, we believe that peak NIMs are now behind (expecting moderation in FY24E).

Motilal Oswal  Reiterate 'buy' with the target price at Rs 1,150.  The bank reported a strong performance in 3QFY23, driven by healthy NII/Core PPoP growth and controlled provisions (despite creation of contingent and additional NPA provisions) underpinned by pristine asset quality.  The stable mix of a high-yielding portfolio (retail/business banking) and a low-cost liability franchise is driving steady NII growth, resulting in margin expansion to 4.65 percent.

icici,2023-01-20T10:55:40+05:30,Aparna Iyer,ICICI Bank Q3 Preview: Expect a robust all-round act; 29% net profit growth,Healthy growth in net interest income is expected on the back of double-digit loan growth and an expansion in the net interest margin. ,"ICICI Bank Ltd is expected to deliver a robust set of operating metrics for the December quarter, powered by a strong loan growth, core interest income expansion and reduction in stressed loans.  The private sector lender is expected to report a net profit of Rs. 7,994 crore for the quarter, up 29 percent from a year ago period, the average estimate of seven securities firms showed. Net interest income (NII) is expected to have grown 28 percent Year-on-Year (YoY) to Rs 15,639 crore for the three months ended December.  The bank will detail its quarterly earnings on January 21.  The healthy growth in NII is expected on the back of double-digit loan growth and an expansion in the net interest margin. Coupled with traction in non-interest r income, the bank is expected to report an operating profit of Rs 12,193 crore, a YoY increase of 20 percent.  ICICI Bank’s loan book has expanded around 20 percent consistently for several quarters now and analysts expect the bank to have repeated this performance in the December quarter as well.  “Loan growth to be solid at 20%, led by healthy contribution from all segments,” wrote analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a note.  In the September quarter, the lender had reported 23 percent growth in its corporate loans and 25 percent expansion in retail loans.  In an interaction with analysts earlier this month, the bank’s management laid out its plans for faster business growth and reduction in costs by relying heavily on technology and digitization. The bank has multiple times pushed its digital heft through a super app that provides prospective and existing customers with a full stack of products of the ICICI Group as well as other financial companies.  Some of these efforts may reflect in the credit growth number of the bank for the third quarter as well. Further, ICICI Bank’s management also indicated its focus on loans to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) during public interactions in the previous quarters.  “As highlighted in our recent notes, we see strong opportunity for ICICI Bank in SME space where it has customised offerings for micro-segments and offered many firsts to clients,” analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd wrote in a note. SME loans form 4.4 percent of the bank’s total book. Retail and SME loans fetch more bang for the buck as they carry wider spreads compared with loans to large companies.  Margin heft  Banks hiked deposit rates sharply during the December quarter and ICICI Bank was not an outlier. Ergo, the lender is likely to have witnessed an increase in its cost of funds. The bank’s margins have expanded for three straight quarters now and may show a marginal increase in the December quarter as well despite headwinds from deposit rate hikes.  “Margins would continue to expand however at a slower rate, as CoF goes up,” analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher wrote in their note. CoF is short for cost of funds. The lender had hiked its deposit rates thrice during the quarter by 50-100 basis points across tenures. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.  Analysts believe that the mix of its loan book and a slower repricing of its deposits limit the impact on margins unlike some of its smaller peers. The share of low-cost current and savings accounts for ICICI Bank is high, at 45 percent as of the September quarter. As stated earlier, the bank’s loan mix has tilted towards retail and small businesses that are conducive to margins. Further, within retail, the bank has grown its unsecured personal loan book faster than the other categories, which supports margins.  Stress out of sight  Analysts expect the bank to report a reduction in fresh slippages for the quarter, thereby bringing down its provisioning needs. The gross bad loan pile is expected to decrease on an aggregate level as well. In the September quarter, the bank had reported a gross bad loan ratio of 3.19 percent, a sharp fall from 4.82 percent a year ago.  “We expect provisions to remain at low levels, given lower slippages and better trends on recovery/upgradation. We are building in slippages of 2% (Rs.50 billion), but we see a solid commentary on recovery to continue resulting in lower stress coming from asset quality perspective,” the Kotak note said.  Shares of the lender have outperformed the broad market for more than a year now and much of the positives are baked into valuations, according to analysts. Investors must watch for the management’s commentary on deposit accretion and the pressure on margins in the coming quarters.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/icici-bank-q3-preview-expect-a-robust-all-round-act-29-net-profit-growth-9900331.html

icici,2023-01-13T11:29:36+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan,How ICICI Bank burned an $850 million hole with wrong bet on Australian coal mine,"Three other Indian banks also put money on the table for the acquisition of the Griffin Coal mine by Lanco, which went bankrupt. The loans turned bad in 2017 and ICICI Bank is learned to have fully provided for the losses in FY18.  ","When large-scale corporate loan write-offs have come under scrutiny in India, one such sorry saga by an Indian bank is getting a lot of attention in Australia.  An $850 million (around Rs 6,919 crores at current dollar prices) loan advanced in tranches to India’s Lanco Group by ICICI Bank since 2010 when Chanda Kochhar was at the helm turned bad in 2017. The funds were lent to Lanco for the acquisition of the Griffin Coal mine in Western Australia.  Since then, the lenders are technically stuck with effective ownership of the lossmaking mine, having acquired pledged shares, and are reportedly silent on ceding control, according to an Australian media report in November.  The Griffin mine supplies coal to the Bluewaters Power station in Western Australia. Bluewaters is owned by Japanese power utility Kansai Electric and global trading company Sumitomo Corp., according to its website.  The loan  The total amount lent by the banks in the consortium—including Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank and Exim Bank—works out to about $1.4 billion (around Rs 11,396 crore at current prices), according to people familiar with the developments. Among them, ICICI Bank has a relatively significant exposure to the failed mine.  According to Australian media reports, ICICI Bank’s loans to Lanco for the Griffin buyout stood at $1.1 billion (around Rs 8954 crore at current prices) at one point, after initially lending $750 million (around Rs 6,105 crore at current prices).  The bank’s exposure to Griffin at this point is about $850 million, a person in the know told Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity. This became a non-performing asset (NPA) in 2017 and was fully provided for during FY18, the person said.  “This is one of the loans that went wrong for the bank,” said the person quoted above. “It became an NPA in 2017-18 and ICICI Bank has fully provided for it. The entire exposure to Lanco is provided for.”  Emails sent to ICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank, and Exim Bank requesting comments on the matter remained unanswered. A separate email sent to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) asking whether the regulator has looked into the matter was unanswered.  Wrong bet  How did ICICI Bank and the other lenders get dragged into the deal?  To be sure, it wasn’t ICICI Bank alone that sought a slice of the pie of risky corporate loans in 2010. Most Indian banks were upbeat at that time on the global energy story and wanted a share of it. ICICI Bank was no exception.  Additionally for ICICI Bank, the Lanco loan was granted at about the time the bank took a Rs 3,250 crore disastrous bet on the Videocon Group back home, under its former chief Kochhar. This loan was allegedly part of a quid pro quo deal between the Kochhar family and Videocon’s Venugopal Dhoot, according to later probes.  ICICI Bank’s funding enabled Lanco to try its luck in the tricky Australian coal mine business. Using the loan money, Lanco acquired Griffin Coal in 2011 through its Australian subsidiary. According to Lanco’s website, Griffin was the largest individual supplier of thermal coal to Western Australia's industrial coal market with over 1.2 billion tonnes of coal resources.  The cookie crumbles  The bet went wrong in all possible ways—for the buyer and the financiers.  In the years that followed, production at Griffin was less than optimal and Lanco reeled under a huge debt burden back home that would ultimately push the group to bankruptcy.  Lanco’s woes doubled in August 2018, when the Indian bankruptcy court ordered the liquidation of Lanco Infratech, the group’s holding company.  Analysts said Lanco paid too high a price for Griffin, which produced poor quality coal unsuited for exports. This raised the question of the efficiency of ICICI Bank’s due diligence process when it ascertained the creditworthiness of the borrower.  To cut a long story short, it isn’t an exaggeration to say that the coal mine turned out to be a white elephant for Lanco and its lenders.  Lanco finally hit a wall in 2017, when lenders took over the shares pledged against the loan after the company defaulted on payments, effectively taking ownership of the failed mine.  The Press Trust of India reported a Lanco official as saying in December 2017 that Griffin coal was no longer a subsidiary of the group after the lenders took over the pledged shares.  However, for the lenders, the damage was already done. It had to tag the funding for Lanco’s misadventure as an NPA and provide for it. A loan becomes an NPA if there is no repayment of interest or principal for 90 days. Provisions refer to money set aside to cover potential losses.  Sitting duck  An important question at this stage is whether ICICI Bank and the other lenders own the failed mine now.  According to Australia’s ABC News, since Lanco went bankrupt, ownership of Griffin is effectively with the lenders.  The reports suggest that lenders are now pushing for higher coal prices that could cause a commensurate increase for consumers in Western Australia, which faced a growing energy crisis.  “Despite the bank’s continued silence on its plans for the operation, it is understood ICICI is pushing for big increases to the price Griffin receives for its coal,” the report said. Reportedly, the Australian authorities are in talks with the lenders on this issue.  However, the person quoted above denied the lender’s ownership of the mine.  “The bank doesn’t have the ownership. Bluewaters Power wants the bank to take the ownership,” the person said.  Moneycontrol couldn’t independently verify this claim.  Will the bank get any money back from Griffin?  There is only hope left at this point. The bank expects that the Australian government’s efforts to revive the failed Griffin coal mine will help to improve cashflows and enable some writeback of the provisions made.  “If any money comes back, the bank is happy,” the person said.  But, according to ABC News, the mining lease of Griffin will expire in July and the Australian authorities need to be convinced of the owner’s financial capability. That will be another challenge for the lenders.  A larger problem  The Lanco loan is only one of many huge corporate loan bets that have gone wrong with Indian banks since 2010. When such loans were not repaid, banks resorted to large-scale corporate write-offs as part of a massive book-cleaning exercise started in 2015 by former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan.  India’s scheduled commercial banks wrote off loans of over Rs 10 lakh crore ($121 billion) during the past five financial years, according to data submitted by the government in Parliament. A loan is written off when there is no scope of recovery and banks want to take the bad asset off their balance sheets.  But this exercise comes at a cost to the bank. The provisions made on such loans affect their profitability. That’s not good news for shareholders and investors.  Recovery from such loans is always insignificant. Public sector banks could recover only about Rs 1 lakh crore from the written-off loans over the past financial years.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/icici-bank-lanco-bad-loan-griffin-coal-mine-australia-loan-write-off-chanda-kochhar-bob-iob-exim-850-million-9858651.html

The new funding round was a mix of long-term debt capital from venture debt firms Alteria Capital and Stride Ventures and working capital finance from banks such as Standard Chartered Bank, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank, the company said in a statement on January 11. LEAD plans to use the funding for financing the company's organic and inorganic growth, the company said.  Last week, LEAD acquired learning company Pearson’s K-12 (kindergarten through standard 12) business in India and the company said it would fund the acquisition through new fundraising and internal accruals. However, the company did not disclose anything on the new fundraise then.  LEAD's debt fundraise comes at a time when many direct-to-consumer edtech companies in the country are struggling to raise equity funding amid a slowdown in venture capital and private equity investments. Edtech companies are thus looking to cut costs as they are expecting slower growth in the coming quarters.  “Traditionally, startups have had limited avenues for raising capital beyond equity. However, with our strong unit economics and a clear path to profitability, we have been able to attract non-dilutive, traditional capital from India’s biggest banks and largest venture debt funds, which is value accretive to our shareholders,” said Sumeet Mehta, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of LEAD.  “LEAD is poised for 2X growth and this latest round of funding will help us fast-track our mission of providing high quality, integrated School Edtech solutions to over 60,000 schools across India by 2026,” Mehta added.  Founded by Mehta and Smita Deorah in 2012, LEAD runs a platform that tracks teacher and student progress, managing school operations on the cloud and providing digital resources to make learning more engaging. The company turned a unicorn in January 2022.  For FY22, LEAD reported a net loss of Rs 397.1 crore, which widened from Rs 126.1 crore a year earlier, as the company's employee benefit costs surged more than 2.5 times during the year. However, with schools reopening in FY22, LEAD managed to double its revenue to Rs 141.6 crore in FY22 from a year earlier.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/school-edtech-platform-lead-raises-rs-160-crore-in-debt-capital-a-day-after-layoffs-9849301.html

icici,2023-01-09T09:35:39+05:30,Tamal Bandyopadhyay, Book excerpt | How Sandeep Bakhshi set aside hierarchy and reset ICICI Bank's culture after Chanda...,"In calling up bankers four or five rungs junior to him, opening up the executive dining room and sharing credit, Sandeep Bakhshi marks a departure from the usual in many ways.","Having covered the banking sector for around 25 years, journalist Tamal Bandyopadhyay veers away from monetary policy and banking decision to focus on key bankers themselves, in his latest book Roller Coaster: An Affair with Banking.  Among the bankers whose quirks, stories, and leadership journeys Bandyopadhyay shares in the book are Uday Kotak, Sandeep Bakhshi, Amitabh Chaudhry, V. Vaidyanathan, C. Rangarajan, Bimal Jalan, Y.V. Reddy, D. Subbarao, Raghuram Rajan, Urjit Patel, Shaktikanta Das and ICICI managing director and CEO Sandeep Bakhshi—a section from the chapter on Bakhshi is excerpted here:  No Limelight Seeker  Unlike (Chanda) Kochhar, Bakhshi does not believe in grabbing the limelight. He did not take his salary in the COVID-hit financial year 2020–21, but the bank did not make this a public relations topic. The media got to know this only from the bank’s annual report for the year.  A journalist once told Bakhshi that he had done a fantastic job with the bank’s mobile banking app iMobile Pay, which was adjudged as one of the best in the world and far ahead of the competition in India. Bakhshi attributed this to the team at ICICI Bank. He reminded the journalist that the app was launched in 2008.  Bakhshi had taken the helm in 2018 after Kochhar was shown the door.  When the journalist pointed out that the bank had transformed the app to allow customers of any bank to use it (this was done in December 2020), a first-of-its-kind initiative in India, Bakhshi said: “We do upgrade our app every now and then; it’s like upgrading software for any of your devices.”  This attitude is rare in the world of bankers, where people happily take credit for good work done by others.  At internal presentations prepared by group heads, Bakhshi doesn’t like superlative adjectives such as “dominant” or “dominating” (e.g., “The bank is holding a dominant position in a particular business segment”) as he feels nothing is permanent in the stacking order. If the bank is doing well in a business, he prefers focussing on maintaining the position instead of bragging about it.   340 pages; Rs 499.  Bakhshi hates  hierarchy—something omnipresent  in Indian banking. This is evident from the way he conducts meetings—the order of speakers, the order of seating, and so on. He calls up people even four-five ranks junior to him, something unheard of in ICICI Bank’s history. He has allowed all senior leaders (some 400 top managers) to have lunch in the room that was earlier earmarked for directors. Kochhar used to occupy the head of the table, always.  Bakhshi also threw out a rule that an employee would get a loan for a car allowed by the pay grade. Now, the loan amount is linked to the pay grade, but the employee can buy any car they want. As a result, many employees drive fancy vehicles today, while Bakhshi himself has a Mahindra SUV and a mid-sized sedan. Earlier, only the directors used to drive top-end cars.  While we are on the topic of cars: One of Bakhshi’s colleagues in ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company told me this story to explain his style of leadership.  Before his current assignment, Bakhshi had stints at both the insurance outfits in the group as MD and CEO—ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company as well as ICICI Lombard. Lokanath P. Kar, fondly called “Elpee sir” by his colleagues, who left ICICI Lombard in early 2022 as the chief legal and compliance officer, told me this story.  Kar joined ICICI Lombard in 2006 when Bakhshi was the CEO. Those days, Kar used to live in Goregaon, in the Western Suburbs, and travel to the office, located at Zenith House on Keshavrao Khadye Marg, Mahalaxmi, by his car.  Driving Lesson, Life Lesson  Kar, a wildlife enthusiast, was fond of music and literature, and there was great chemistry between Bakhshi and him. Kar had his car and a driving licence, but he used to suffer from amaxophobia, or the fear of driving.  Bakhshi was quietly hatching a plan to cure this! And he got the opportunity on a rainy day in July 2007.  Fed up with the frequent absence of his driver, Kar decided to drive his car to the office that day. Pradipta Sahu, a colleague who used to be the national manager of HR in the company, and a neighbour, offered to accompany him. Pradipta kept guiding and encouraging Kar all the way while he drove.  In the evening, while it was time to go home, Pradipta informed Kar that he had already left the office to attend a meeting and would go home from there.  It was heavily raining that Monday evening. Kar sat in the driver’s seat but could not muster the courage to drive the vehicle home through the busy Tulsi Pipe Road that monsoon evening in Mumbai. He got out of the car and didn’t know what was to be done.  Seeing him standing at the portico, Bakhshi enquired if Kar had his car. A little embarrassed, Kar nodded, pointed to his parked car, and said he was waiting for Pradipta to join.  Bakhshi smiled and got into his car.  After moving a few meters, his car reversed, and Bakhshi dropped the window and asked Kar pointedly, “LP! Do you know how to drive?” Kar was stunned and didn’t know what to say. Finally, Bakhshi got down from his car, put his arm around Kar’s shoulder, and said: “What’s the big deal about driving a car? All that you have to do is to be on the wheel and manage the immediate situations. Home will come on its own.”  He insisted that Kar get into the car and take to the wheel. Before Kar started, Bakhshi repeated: “Never ever drive to reach home. Keep that objective at the back of your mind. Remain focused only on what you see through the windscreen.” He stood there while Kar slowly drove away. After Kar reached home, he received a call from Bakhshi. He sounded a little worried and enquired if Kar had reached home safely.  “You know, LP, I was very worried all this while.”  For Kar, it was not a driving lesson; it was a life lesson.  He drove down safely—and never looked back. Soon, he started driving to his office and within a few months, he started driving long distances such as Lonavala and Khandala. That was Bakhshi’s master stroke to kill Kar’s fear of driving.  This is just one example of how he helps his colleagues realise their potential and get the best out of them.  Another incident shows a different side of Bakhshi’s character as a leader.  It was March 2008, and ICICI Lombard was falling marginally short of its annual topline target. Being at the fag- end of the financial year, the company’s entire management team was trying hard to write a few crores of premium so that it could maintain its “never-missed-the-target” reputation.  There was a state government-sponsored health insurance scheme for mass insurance cover, and the government had invited ICICI Lombard to make a presentation. The existing scheme was expiring in the second half of March. The state government was eager to close the insurance contract before the existing cover’s expiry to ensure there was no gap in the beneficiaries’ cover.  The proposed premium for the scheme was enough to take ICICI Lombard far ahead of its annual budget. All of them were too eager to close the contract and book the premium before the end of the financial year.  The senior state bureaucrat who was responsible for the scheme wanted a clause to be inserted in the contract, which, for a certain set of claims, would take away the right of the company to determine whether the claim falls within the scope of the cover and vests that right with the state government. If this was accepted, the company would simply act upon the government’s instructions on determining entitlement for that set of claims. In a typical insurance structure, this amounts to handing over the claims pen to the insured.  Being responsible for contracts, Kar was negotiating the terms. He was keen on bagging the project as it would help ICICI Lombard meet its target. At the same time, he was aware that such a clause would certainly jeopardise the company’s interests. The state government was unwilling to bend and make any change in the contract which was to be signed the next day.  Kar called up Bakhshi and explained the situation. “Let me come along with you tomorrow; we will see,” was his response. The next morning, Kar and his boss went to the office of the senior bureaucrat, who was almost ready to sign the contract. Bakhshi, in his typical yogic expression, tried to explain to him how difficult it was for the company to accept such a condition. However, the bureaucrat, who was anticipating this, expressed his inability to consider his request. Bakhshi simply stood up and said he would not sign the contract.  The bureaucrat was not expecting this. He got furious. But Bakhshi held Kar’s hand and calmly walked away from the office.  While driving back to the office, Kar asked him, “Shouldn’t we have looked for some alternatives?” Bakhshi’s answer was: “It’s not about doing a business deal; it is always about performing upon the business one commits. I know none of you would enjoy this business. Just for the sake of meeting the target, I can’t undertake a tiring responsibility for all of us.”  For the record, ICICI Lombard did not miss the budget that year.  As the CEO of India’s second-largest private bank, Bakhshi sees himself playing the role of a trustee. Life is temporary, and the time spent in the corner office is even more transient, while the kurshi of the CEO is permanent. Why take yourself so seriously and behave like an emperor?

Besides, the case also highlights how top management officials, like Kochhar herself, misused their positions for wrongful financial gains, also destroying a career built over years of hard work, former bankers said.  “There was no financial rationale for lending loans of such massive amounts to companies with financial books in lakhs and some crores. The other motivation behind the deal is now out,” said Naresh Malhotra, a former State Bank of India (SBI) senior official who presently works as a banking industry consultant.  Another former banker with Canara Bank said that the root cause of such malpractices is a clear misuse of power by the top management.  “One clearly knows that whatever forging the deals today will someday come out,” the banker with Canara Bank said.  Kochhar was arrested on charges of cheating and rule violations to award a Rs 3,250 crore loan to Videocon group against which Videocon promoter Venugopal Dhoot invested in NuPower Renewables, a company owned by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar. The deal amounted to a quid-pro-quo deal, the CBI said.  The case, however, highlights the need for a total change in the way large corporate loan deals are carried out, experts say. The Kochhar-Videocon scam involved a raft of deals using which Dhoot invested in Kochhar’s firm and later transferred the ownership to Deepak Kochhar.  Apart from Kochhars, the CBI arrested Dhoot also in connection with the case.  Need for more checks and accountability?  Experts pointed out how lack of quality background checks, despite credit committees in place, can largely leave the process unchecked like in the case of the ICICI Bank-Videocon case.  “Relaxation in the process, lack of governance from members of the credit committee, and lastly personal motives can result in massive defaults,” an analyst with a global financial analysis firm said. He too declined to be named.  “One of the key things that banks have to work on is to implement routine background checks on its key management members so as to ensure that they do not induce their personal motives,” the analyst added.  Explaining his point further, Malhotra said individual accountability of officers in large corporate loan deals is a must.  “Collective accountability will only worsen the situation and lead to more fraud lending as not a single person will be held accountable in a case,” Malhotra said.  The former banker with Canara bank, quoted above, too echoed the same and said that one key person held accountable can bring important awareness and checks in the process.  What is the case?   The ICICI Bank-Videocon case is one of the most high-profile scams witnessed by the Indian banking industry which marked the downfall of Kochhar, who started as a junior officer in the bank and later rose through the ranks to head the company.  The case came into the limelight when in 2016, whistleblower Arvind Gupta, a Delhi-based activist, wrote to the Prime Minister’s Office, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and other authorities pointing to suspicious financial transactions between the ICICI bank, Deepak Kochhar and Videocon chief Venugopal Dhoot.  It was alleged that Kochhar and her family members received various kickbacks over her tenure in lieu of loans provided to the Videocon group, many of which would eventually turn into non-performing assets (NPAs). The CBI alleged cheating and irregularities in loans sanctioned by the bank to the Videocon group between 2009 and 2011 when Kochhar was heading the bank.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/chanda-kochhar-arrest-highlights-need-for-stronger-checks-tighter-scrutiny-in-credit-process-in-banks-experts-9766871.html
icici,2022-12-26T12:25:45+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan,How Venugopal Dhoot’s quid-pro-quo money led to Kochhars’ downfall,"Dhoot’s investments Deepak Kochhar’s companies, shortly after securing a loan from Chanda Kochhar-headed ICICI Bank, became the corner stone of India’s biggest banking scandal  ","In March, 2018,  even when a whistleblower letter unearthed one of the biggest scams in Indian banking involving the quid-pro-quo deal between Chanda Kochhar’s family and industrialist Venugopal Dhoot, the Videocon group chief maintained that he didn’t know Chanda Kochhar personally.  In one of his non-agenda meetings with a financial journalist at Mittal court office in Mumbai’s Nariman point shortly after the revelations, Dhoot vehemently denied about any links with Chanda Kochhar or the loan deal. “I don’t know her personally. My hands are clean. Let the investigators probe if there is anything amiss,” said Dhoot.  But the probe agencies didn’t buy Dhoot’s story. Probes subsequently revealed a clear quid-pro-quo deal between the two parties. The Central bureau of investigation (CBI) which filed the chargesheet in 2019 January, arrested Chanda Kochhar three years later on 23 December along with her husband Deepak Kochhar. Three days later, the agency arrested Dhoot too.  How did the scam happen?  It was a clear quid-pro-quo deal, the CBI alleged. The Videocon promoter allegedly invested crores of rupees in Deepak Kochhar-owned NuPower Renewables Pvt Ltd (NRPL) months after the Videocon Group got Rs 3,250 crore as loan from ICICI Bank in 2012, the CBI had said in a statement after filing of the FIR in 2019.  Subsequently, Dhoot reportedly handed over full ownership of the Joint Venture to Deepak Kochhar for a small investment some six months after the sanction of the abovementioned loan. This amounted to criminal conspiracy and cheating, the probe agency said.  What is Nupower?  NuPower was set up by Dhoot and the Kochhars as an equal JV in 2008. Dhoot-owned Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd pumped Rs 64 crore into NuPower in 2010, in the form of fully convertible debentures. Between 2008 and 2012, through multiple transactions Dhoot, who originally owned half of NuPower, transferred a majority stake to Kochhar. These transactions involved Supreme Energy, Pinnacle Energy, a trust where Deepak Kochhar was the managing trustee, and Dhoot’s associate Mahesh Chandra Punglia. Parallelly, a Mauritius-based firm, DH Renewables, also invested in NuPower.  That’s one side of the story. The loan deal is even more mysterious.  Investigators found that between June, 2008 to October, 2011, the ICICI Bank sanctioned six high value loans to Videocon group companies. The agency accused Chanda Kochhar for cheating the bank by abusing her official position as the CEO by sanctioning these loans. Later, as mentioned above, the probe revealed that this was part of a quid-pro-quo deal between Kochhars and Videocon's Dhoot.  At one point, NuPower was equally owned by Videocon and Kochhar, with each holding about 75000 shares each. This means the initial share base and investment was very small. Thereafter, when Kochhar invested Rs 1.89 crore, he received 18.9 lakh shares, taking his total to 19.72 lakh shares, whereas Videocon's remained the same. In percentage terms, Kochhar thus controlled 96 percent of the JV. Subsequently, Videocon's shareholding fell to less than three percent.  Kochhar allegedly misused her position as the top executive of the bank while sanctioning these loans. In its chargesheet, the CBI had said that ICICI Bank, under Kochhar, sanctioned loans to Videocon in violation of the credit policies of the bank. These loans later turned Non-performing assets (NPAs) resulting in wrongful loss to the bank and wrongful gain to the borrowers and accused persons. The CBI also sought probes into the role of the senior officers of the sanctioning committee which had cleared the loans to Videocon. Further, the investigative agency highlighted that the credit limit for the Videocon group companies was approved after Kochhar took over charge as top executive of the bank in May, 2009.  The ICICI Bank-Videocon case is one of the most high-profile scams witnessed  by Indian banking industry. This marked the downfall of Chanda Kochhar, who started as a junior officer in the bank and later rose through the ranks to head the company.

This amounted to criminal conspiracy and cheating, the probe agency said.  Kochhar's termination  In May 2018, ICICI Bank initiated an inquiry against Kochhar. The former CEO went on leave thereafter and later applied for early retirement, which was accepted. The bank then said it had treated her separation as &quot;Termination for Cause&quot; and had also sought approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for Kochchar's termination of appointment as is mandatory under the provisions of the RBI Act.  On November 10, the Bombay High Court said the termination of Chanda Kochhar from the post of CEO of ICICI Bank was prima facie “valid termination” and dismissed her interim application seeking post-retirement benefits.  A single bench of Justice RI Chagla also directed Kochhar to not deal with the bank's 6.90 lakh shares she had acquired in 2018. She was also told to disclose in an affidavit all dealings with respect to the shares within six weeks.  Read More: Chanda Kochhar: A look at the career and controversial exit of ICICI Bank CEO and MD  In her application, Kochhar sought specific performance of the entitlements and benefits that were unconditionally provided to her when the bank accepted her early retirement in 2018.

The benefits granted to her, unconditionally, included employee stock options that were exercisable till 2028.  But the court wasn’t convinced by Kochhar’s arguments. Besides, Kochhar contended that the Justice Srikrishna inquiry was a preliminary probe and could not result in disciplinary action.  The court said didn't find merit in that argument. “I further find no fault in the inquiry headed by Justice Srikrishna (retired), which is with the view to ensure a fair and independent process, particularly with regard to the allegations of misconduct made against the MD and CEO of the ICICI Bank,” the court said.

However, investors should rotate out of staples and cement in six months, he added.  “In the cement sector, there is good demand visibility for the next few months till Q2FY24, when the seasonally weak quarter begins,” said Shah. He said Budget 2023 will create many opportunities, with subsidies expected for infrastructure schemes including Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and rural employment guarantee projects. These subsidies eventually lead to creation of an asset, so they are as good as capital expenditure, he explained.  Staples are expected to do well as rural sentiment is slowly turning the corner.  “All factors for a bounce-back in demand are lining up, like moderating of inflation and increase in non-farm income,” he said.  Foreign institutional investors and domestic mutual funds are materially underweight on staples versus their historical averages. Thus, the sector could see greater inflows in 2023, BofA Securities said.  Also Read: Nifty to hit 20,000 in 2023, driven by FII flows, says BofA Securities  Another good defensive bet, according to Shah, is the utilities sector.  “Reforms that are currently in the draft stage which propose privatisation of power distribution operations could be a game-changer,” he said.  Valuations are undemanding, with one-year forward price-to-book ratio at 1.4x.  Underweight sectors  BofA Securities is underweight on the information technology, automobile and healthcare sectors.  “21 percent of the Nifty is export-linked and these sectors will see the sharpest earnings cut,” said Shah.  The firm expects the earnings cut for the automobile sector to be 79 percent, the highest. Healthcare will likely get a 19 percent cut and IT 14 percent.  “Despite heavy outflows, FII positioning still remains slightly overweight on the IT sector and this has potential to reduce further. Valuations at 24x versus an average of 19x don’t give us any comfort,” he said.  Also Read: IT stocks head for worst year since 2008 as growth winter sets in  Long-term bets  The bottom line is India will outperform developed market equities but will underperform emerging markets next year. With India’s structural story intact, financials and industrials will be good long-term bets, said Shah.  “There could be some contraction in net interest margins as the competition for deposits takes off amid banks. But there is good visibility on earnings and strong asset quality,” he explained.  The recent run-up in public sector banks is not keeping BofA at bay.  “The stocks are still trading below their book value and there is more steam left,” he said.  BofA Securities’ pecking order in the financials space is private and public sector banks over insurance companies. Non-banking financiers come last in the list.

The bank has also partnered with multiple newage fintechs/start-ups in co-lending, liability, analytics, and collection space to acquire digitally native customers, increase wallet share, manage credit risk and, thus, improve customer-level RoE.

However, those are smaller tickets loans and banks have been their tightening the underwriting norms.”  A loan turns bad when a borrower does not pay interest on it for over 90 days.  Banks are continuing with the strategy to aggressively build their retail loan book. Lenders find retail loans safer compared with risky corporate loans because default rates are relatively lower.  Also read: Banking Central | Will aggressive retail loan drive boomerang on banks?  What’s driving retail loan growth?   In the July-September quarter, most banks reported a sharp rise in retail loans. HDFC Bank, for instance, grew its retail loan book by 21.4 percent against a 2 percent increase in corporate and other wholesale loans.  ICICI Bank reported 25 percent growth in retail loans on a Year-on-Year (YoY) basis. State Bank of India’s retail personal advances alone grew by nearly 19 percent YoY in the quarter.  Not just that, a majority of banks have guided that the share of retail loans on their book will be higher than corporate loans in the coming quarters.  IDBI Bank’s Deputy Managing Director Suresh Khatanhar told Moneycontrol that the bank is looking at diversifying to other products apart from mortgage loans. These include auto loans, personal loans and education loans.  Bank of Baroda’s Managing Director Sanjiv Chadha said that from a risk-management viewpoint it is better to have a higher proportion of retail than corporate loans.  “I would expect that our growth in retail would continue to outstrip corporate growth for a few quarters, going ahead,” Chadha said.  COVID-hit economy recovers   According to bankers and analysts, the primary reason why banks are bullish on retail loan growth is that the COVID-hit economy is seeing signs of recovery.  There has been a revival in consumer spending, credit growth has picked up and banks’ collection efficiency has improved.  According to data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for September, personal loans jumped 19.6 percent YoY, compared with 13.2 percent a year back.  Within retail loans, credit card outstanding loans has risen sharply by 27.2 percent, compared with 11.3 percent in the previous year.  “We believe banks have focussed on retail for some time as capex demand is weaker and not secular. It does imply confidence in the retail book and some opportunities after the coming off of bottlenecks in some sectors like auto,” said Hemali Dhame, associate vice president – research at Kotak Securities. “On a low base, revolving rates are lower, implying credit card (lending) could be aggressive.  Home loans remain a strong proposition as well.”  Also read: What is causing the sudden surge in banks’ education loan books?   Asset quality woes ahead?   The key question to ask is whether these loans will prove to be risky for banks. These loans carry a high risk in an economic downturn. In the event of a major global economic slowdown, accompanied with high interest rates and massive job losses, these could turn bad and create for problems for banks.  “Although the delinquency levels in aggregate consumer credit (across all categories) have declined in the last fiscal year for both public and private sector banks, with inflation still being high and without sustained growth in wages and job creation, there is a risk of consumers’ repayment capacity being hurt,” Abhishek Kumar, associate fellow, and Divya Srinivasan, research analyst, at Centre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP), wrote.  Inflation has been the buzzword in the economy. Persistently higher inflation has been the pain-point not just for the RBI, but also for borrowers. The RBI has hiked the repo rate by 190 basis points since May to curb inflationary pressure. Banks are quick to pass on the impact of rate hikes to customers.  Buying power   High inflation, on the other hand, erodes the purchasing power of borrowers and erodes their disposable income. That apart, instances of job losses have been quite high and that could hurt the repayment capacity of borrowers.  The RBI has failed to meet its price mandate, with the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for September confirming a third straight quarter in which average inflation has stayed outside the tolerance band of 2-6 percent.  According to data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on October 12, headline retail inflation rose to 7.41 percent in September from 7.00 percent in August.  Already, some banks have seen higher retail slippages in the July-September quarter. For instance, Bank of Baroda’s fresh retail slippages rose to Rs 585 crore compared to Rs 451 crore last year and Rs 575 crore in April-June.  Bankers said that although risks persist, the overall asset quality of banks is healthier, enabling them to absorb such stress.  “Right now, the focus for banks is to grow the retail book and gain a share of the pie. Yes, incrementally stress can crop up; we are even bracing for some slippages but you have to remember that overall health of the banks have also improved,” said a banker with a state-run bank on condition of anonymity.  The banker added that retail loans are generally small ticket loans, and with tighter underwriting practices, adequate provisions and early warning signals could help banks prevent huge asset quality risks.  Kotak Securities’ Dhame said that there is little evidence of high retail slippages as yet, and the trend will only become visible with time.  “We may (have to) wait to see a few more signs. Banks balance sheets are stronger now and these loans are granular, which is de-risking for the banks,” added Dhame.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks-may-see-higher-retail-loan-slippages-as-inflation-job-losses-bite-borrowers-9480861.html

That’s the view of Arun Srinivasan, head of fixed income at ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd., the country’s fourth-biggest by market capitalization, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.  In anticipating yields are close to their peak, he’s betting the Reserve Bank of India could possibly revive its Operation Twist program of 2019, when it sold shorter-dated debt while buying longer maturities to flatten the curve.    “This is the appropriate time to add longer duration bonds,” said Srinivasan, who oversees 1.3 trillion rupees ($15.7 billion) in fixed income debt. “We have been increasing duration and will continue to target every auction.”  Although the global bond market has suffered a 20% rout this year as central banks ratchet up interest rates to rein in inflation, ICICI is one of a number of investors growing more bullish on the asset class.  Rick Rieder, BlackRock Inc.’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, told Bloomberg last week he sees opportunities in corporate credit. Strategists at Barclays Plc wrote that high-grade credit looked more attractive than equities.  But the ICICI investor is still staying away from corporate bonds because the yield differential -- currently roughly 30 basis points for 10-year debt -- isn’t large enough yet to be enticing in light of of the additional risk.  “I expect spreads to go back to their long term average of 55 to 60 basis points, if not more,” said Srinivasan.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/icici-pru-life-is-buying-more-long-dated-government-debt-9425391.html
icici,2022-10-31T15:46:50+05:30,Siddhi Nayak,"Rate war to mop up deposits may hurt banks’ margins, say experts","Net Interest Margin — the amount of money that a bank earns in interest on loans compared to the amount it pays in interest on deposits — is an indicator of profitability and growth. If deposit rates outpace lending rates, then bank NIMs will shrink","The aggressive drive for deposits in the backdrop of tight liquidity conditions may have an adverse effect on bank margins next fiscal year, say experts.  Banks have been aggressively accumulating deposits by offering higher, lucrative interest rates to depositors following four consecutive repo rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  The central bank is fighting a tough battle to contain persistently high retail inflation, which is hitting common households hard.  The impact of aggressive deposit mobilisation is likely to weigh on banks’ net interest margins (NIM) in the coming quarters, banking experts and analysts told Moneycontrol on October 31. In banking parlance, NIM refers to the amount of money that a bank earns in interest on loans compared to the amount it pays in interest on deposits. It is an indicator of a bank's profitability and growth.  “There are expectations of a rate hike in the next monetary policy, which will still allow banks to pass on the incremental cost to advances linked to the benchmark, and deposit rates will continue to rise with a lag, protecting the NIM for FY23,” said Aditya Acharekar, associate director at CareEdge.  “However, some impact on margins may be seen in the first half of FY24,” he added.  Also read: In search of deposits, bankers embark on door-to-door campaign  Rate transmission and NIM  Rate cues from the RBI are transmitted to the economy when lenders adjust their lending and deposit rates based on the RBI's rate actions. For instance, if the RBI hikes the repo rate, then banks will have to borrow short-term funds at a higher cost from the central bank. Banks are also expected to pass on the benefit to borrowers by offering high-interest rates.  Often, monetary transmission happens based on the prevailing liquidity situation. Typically, banks are quick to pass on rate hikes to consumers through loans, but a pass-through to deposits comes with a lag. For much of FY23, banks took advantage of this scenario, which helped them sustain or improve their NIM.  “We are prepared to take a hit on NIMs next fiscal year, but that is an obvious situation given that we have to fund the credit growth through deposits,” said a banker with a private bank on the condition of anonymity. “Mobilising deposits looks like the way forward.”  According to Arun Malhotra, founding partner and portfolio manager of CapGrow Capital Advisors, banks will have to forego NIMs as they could be compressed in the range of 20-25 bps in the short to medium term. Banks, according to Malhotra, may need to increase spreads on fresh repo-linked loans in the next two to four quarters.  In the July-September quarter, HDFC Bank’s core NIM was at 4.1 percent on total assets, and 4.3 percent based on interest-earning assets. Axis Bank’s NIM was at 3.96 percent, while Kotak Mahindra Bank’s NIM stood at 5.17 percent in the reporting quarter. Relatively smaller peers IndusInd Bank and IDBI Bank reported NIMs of 4.24 percent and 4.37 percent, respectively.  The rate picture   State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, recently made an upward revision in retail term deposit interest rates on amounts below Rs 2 crore, by up to 80 basis points. One bps equals one-hundredth of a percentage point. Indeed, most banks have increased their FD rates following the RBI’s 190 bps repo rate hike in the current cycle to rein in inflation.    According to bankers and experts, the ‘war’ for deposits is likely to continue as the RBI hikes rates further and as credit growth continues to expand. This could happen via aggressive deposit mobilisation in the coming months, said bankers. Analysts and economists expect the RBI to increase the repo rate to 6.50 percent by March from 5.90 percent currently.  Sumant Kathpalia, managing director and chief executive officer of IndusInd Bank, said that the lender would continue with its strategy to granularise deposits. The bank’s liabilities will be priced 50-to-75 bps higher than the market, he said at a conference call after the July-September earnings.  On average, banks have raised interest rates in the range of 25-80 bps across tenors. Fixed deposit rates of top banks in the three-year to five-year tenor for amounts below Rs 1 crore currently stand between 5.65 percent and 6.75 percent.  “It is natural for banks to be aggressive as liquidity remains constrained and credit growth is way ahead of deposit growth,” said Hemali Dhame, associate vice-president, of research, at Kotak Securities. “Many banks have been aggressive already, and some have reached a point where a further increase in rates will cause a passthrough in borrower rates.”  Rush for deposits  The primary reason for the rush for deposits is the tightening liquidity in the banking system due to heavy currency leakage and heightened spending on account of the festive season. The RBI’s dollar sales in the foreign exchange market to prevent the rupee’s depreciation have also tightened liquidity.  The mismatch between credit growth and deposit growth has forced most banks to offer high rates on deposits and increase promotional activities for the same.  “If we look at the July-September banking results for FY23, one consistent finding is that advances are growing faster than deposits,” said Punit Patni, a research analyst at Swastika Investment.  “As a result, we anticipate banks raising their deposit rates in order to maintain CASA (current account savings account) deposits or raise money through term deposits. Additionally, due to the dearth of liquidity and good credit growth demand, all the banks are expected to be aggressive in mobilising deposits.”  This trend is likely to continue as credit growth continues to expand, interest rate hikes become more entrenched and liquidity in the system dries up further.  “We are expecting inflationary pressures to persist, and so rates may keep climbing till the end of this financial year,” said Adhil Shetty, chief executive officer at BankBazaar.com. “We may see small banks offer 8 percent or more (FD rates) during this period. If inflation persists, large banks will follow the trend.”  Analysts and industry experts said that the impact of the deposit rate hikes will also depend on the bank's liability and asset profile. Banks having granular, retail-based liability and floating advances are better placed and will witness a minimal impact on their NIMs, they said.  Jindal Haria, a director at India Ratings and Research, said that most banks would have to continue to increase deposit rates till they are confident deposit growth will mirror loan growth. NIMs, however, could expand some more before deposit pricing catches up fully, he said.  Fund-raising to continue  Apart from mobilising deposits, experts also expect banks to tap the market for funds to meet credit demand.  “Banks will have to raise funds from the capital markets through infra bonds, sub-debt and perpetual bonds quickly for long-term funding requirements to augment credit growth as CDs (certificates of deposit) and FDs may not match their long-term funding requirements,” said Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner at Rockfort Fincap, a Mumbai-based debt advisory firm.  Further, banks that are not able to get sufficient funds through FDs and CDs due to tight liquidity conditions will have to continuously increase rates to compete with their peers, added Srinivasan.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rate-war-to-mop-up-deposits-may-hurt-banks-margins-say-experts-9419661.html

icici,2022-10-19T16:35:44+05:30,Siddhi Nayak,Rising global interest rates take sheen off foreign currency deposits,"Measures announced by RBI to boost inflows have failed to work, data shows","Fund flows into Foreign Currency Non-Resident Bank, or FCNR (B), deposits failed to rise significantly in July and August, despite measures unveiled by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to boost inflows and alleviate pressure on the rupee.  An FCNR account is meant for those who wish to hold deposits in a foreign currency.  FCNR (B) inflows reached $16.02 billion in August, only marginally higher than $15.87 billion in July and down from $19.33 billion in August 2021, according to RBI data released on October 17. In March 2022, FCNR (B) deposits totalled $16.92 billion.  On July 6, the RBI, as a part of broader set of measures to halt the rupee’s rapid depreciation against the dollar, gave banks greater freedom to raise foreign currency deposits from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs).  Announcing the measures, the RBI said it exempted FCNR (B) deposits of banks from computation of Net Demand and Time Liabilities to maintain Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), among other changes.  This relaxation is available for deposits mobilised up to November 4.  CRR is the percentage of banks' deposits maintained in the form of cash. SLR is the percentage of commercial banks' net demand and time liabilities maintained as approved securities  The RBI also decided to temporarily permit banks to raise fresh FCNR (B) and NRE deposits without reference to current regulations on interest rates with effect from July 7. This relaxation is available up to October 31. NRE, or Non-Resident External account, is an account maintained by NRIs to transfer foreign earnings to India.  Following the RBI’s move, banks had increased FCNR (B) deposit rates to mobilise deposits given continuous hikes in the repo rate by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).  At present, State Bank of India (SBI) offers an interest rate of 3.45 percent to 3.90 percent on FCNR (B) US dollar deposits for tenors of one year to five years. ICICI Bank’s rates range from 3.30 percent to 4.15 percent for the same tenors.  Presently, interest rates on FCNR (B) deposits are subject to ceilings of overnight Alternative Reference Rate (ARR) for the respective currency/ swap and a premium of 250 basis points for deposits of 1-3 years maturity, according to bankers. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. ARRs are considered to be free of bank credit risk.  Lacklustre response   Bankers said the response had been lacklustre. This is largely due to the narrowing rate differential with global deposits as the US Federal Reserve has embarked on an aggressive rate hike path to quell inflation, they said.  The Fed has increased the federal funds rate by 300 basis points so far in 2022, compared with a 190 bps repo rate hike by the MPC in the same period. Rate transmission typically happens when banks pass on the rate hikes to consumers through loans and deposits. NRIs typically hold FCNR (B) deposits primarily because of an interest rate advantage.  “Banks very well want to mobilise FCNR (B) deposits and rates are increasing across the board,” said Ajay Khurana, an executive director at Bank of Baroda. “The question to ask is whether NRIs are sufficiently incentivised (to deposit dollars in India) at a time when globally policy rates are increasing faster than those of the RBI.”  Before the start of the rate hike cycle, the Fed funds rate was 0-0.25 percent, while the RBI’s repo rate was 4 percent. Currently, the Fed funds rate stands at 3.00-3.25 percent and the repo rate is 5.90 percent.  A slowdown in growth worldwide and high cost of swaps are also among the reasons why FCNR (B) deposits not increasing at the desired pace, added Khurana.  Other bankers agreed with Khurana’s view.  “If foreign inflows have to pour in significantly, there has to be an incentive for depositors to park their money,” said V Lakshmanan, head of treasury at Federal Bank.  Also read: Rupee sinks to new low of 83 against the dollar  Swap scheme unlikely   In 2013, the taper tantrums caused by the unexpected and potential tightening of US monetary policy led to a precipitous fall in the rupee to a then record low of 68.80 per dollar.  In response, newly appointed RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan announced measures in September 2013 to bolster forex reserves and stabilise the rupee. Those measures garnered $34 billion.  As a part of the measures announced in 2013, the RBI bore the risk in a swap scheme for banks. This made mobilisation of leveraged FCNR (B) deposits highly lucrative.  However, such a scheme is unlikely to be announced this time looking at the rupee’s depreciation against the dollar and the extent of forex reserves, bankers and analysts said.  “We do not expect the RBI to announce measures in which it will bear the risk in a swap scheme for banks,” said Bank of Baroda’s Khurana. “Today, the pace of rupee’s depreciation is far less than what it was in 2013. The RBI, too, has enough forex reserves to defend the rupee.”  In 2013, the LIBOR-linked overseas rates were less attractive than what was offered in India, said Shyam Mani, head - NRI and SME, CSB Bank. Currently, the ARR, is equal or more attractive in the country of residence of NRIs, he added.  LIBOR is short for the London Interbank Offer Rate.  Will flows increase?   According to experts, an significant increase in FCNR (B) deposits may not be on the cards at least until there is stability across markets and the interest rate differential widens further.  “Since the current structure is not like how it was in 2013, we were not quite surprised with the data and in the current situation, any substantial increase in FCNR (B) deposits appears unlikely,” said Federal Bank’s Lakshmanan.  According to Arun Malhotra, founding partner and portfolio manager at CapGrow Capital Advisors, the differential between US interest rates and FCNR (B) deposits needs to be wider for banks to increase inflows, and the global economy also needs to stabilise.  Apart from that, bankers said a lot would depend on how interest rates fare in the coming months, especially the pace at which the Fed hikes rates, given US inflation.  “How the interest rates offered by Indian banks fare over interest rates available in their country of residence will be a key determining factor in the coming days,” added CSB Bank’s Mani.  According to Punit Patni, a research analyst at Swastika Investmart, the rate hikes globally and hawkish commentary by central banks are expected to continue internationally to tame scorching inflation.  Domestic banks won’t be able to match international rates, leading to a muted response toward FCNR (B) deposits despite the regulatory relaxations and incentives on offer, he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rising-global-interest-rates-take-sheen-off-foreign-currency-deposits-9356861.html

icici,2022-10-11T10:34:25+05:30,Siddhi Nayak,Fintech Files Part 4 | Why tie-ups with fintechs are the best way for banks to make tech strides,"Collaboration between banks and fintechs is the new normal in the banking space. Indeed, rather than competing with each other, it makes eminent sense for the two sides to combine their respective strengths and play the market together, say industry players","The date was October 6, 2022. The stage was set, and the room was abuzz, flickering with multiple disco lights. HDFC Bank was all set to launch its newest digital initiative in one of Mumbai’s fancy five-star hotels. Bankers, fintech players and journalists were all there, revelling in one of the most glittering events in the banking landscape.  The event was the launch of the SmartHub Vyapar Merchant app, which would facilitate instant, digital and paperless merchant on-boarding for the bank’s customers. The app was developed by HDFC Bank in partnership with Mintoak Innovations, a merchant SaaS (software as a service) platform.  Such events, to launch their digital initiatives, have become the new normal in the banking space. Banks today are no longer confined to their traditional brick-and-mortar setup or the exhausting paperwork of old. They are getting with it.  Fintechs fuelling change   A major reason for banks constantly revolutionising and upgrading their digital services is the rise of fintechs. Relying on smartphones for almost everything is the new normal, particularly when it comes to financial services. Fintech companies have become an integral part of the country’s economy, keeping it on the move.  Today, India has more than 7,000 fintech startups, operating in various segments. Such is the breadth of their presence that they have a finger in every pie, from payments and online credit facilities to subscription management and peer-to-peer lending.  With the growing presence of fintechs, banks have realised that they need to gear up on the technology front. Banks are using artificial intelligence to ensure smooth customer identification and authentication, while also mimicking live employees through chatbots and voice assistants.  The use of Aadhaar and video know-your-customer (KYC) along with card-less cash withdrawals and paperless customer on-boarding are some of the tools that reflect acceleration in the digitisation of banking in India.  Gone are the days when consumers had to wait for hours to reach the front of the queue, complete formalities, fill forms and access customer care for assistance at banks. With fintech banking solutions, self-service capabilities provide customers with operational processes that were previously only available via a physical branch. Not just that, bank-to-bank payments have become the new normal.  The opportunity to tap this trend is huge. According to an E&amp;amp;Y report, only about 12 percent of Indian adults—fewer than 20 percent of account owners —had made a digital merchant payment in 2021. However, two-thirds of those who made a digital merchant payment did so for the first time after the onset of COVID-19. Also, the share of account owners with an inactive account in India is 35 percent, which was the highest globally in 2021.  Fintechs have been driving this change.  “The primary evolution that the fintech players in the country have brought in is that they have digitalised financial processes. One of the major trends in the fintech sector is digital lending, through which borrowers can avail of a loan through applications on their mobile,” said Mahesh Shukla, founder of PayMe, a fintech.  According to Shukla, fintechs have also significantly reduced and also simplified the documentation process. One of the major challenges in conventional banking is that it was earlier difficult for people in rural areas to access loans. Fintech has made it easy for people from all parts of the country to do so online, added Shukla.  Globally, too, cross-border remittance is a growing opportunity, with payment volumes expected to cross the $156 trillion mark in 2022, according to the E&amp;amp;Y report. Banks would require technology to cater to this growth, something that fintech companies are already providing.  Also read: HDFC Bank aiming to onboard 2 crore merchants in the next three years: top official  Rise in fintechs  As of July 2022, India had over 7,300 fintech startups, according to &quot;The Winds of Change&quot; report presented by EY during the 2022 Global Fintech Festival in Mumbai. The EY report said Indian fintechs received $7.8 billion in funding in 2021, way more than the $2.9 billion they received in 2020.  According to the Chiratae and EY report, lending AUMs in Indian fintech have the potential to grow from $38 billion currently to $515 billion by 2030.  Fintechs are increasingly looking to capture underserved markets with their presence, convenience and technology. With the growing number of fintechs in India, banks are beginning to feel the heat and are gearing up on the technology front.  Kotak Mahindra Bank, for example, hired a chief technology officer recently, while other big lenders such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are ramping up tech teams through lateral hiring.  Fino Payments Bank has also appointed a Chief Digital Officer and plans to recruit many people for this division to drive digital banking among the youth.  “Several years back, most banks and large institutions began hiring Chief Digital Officers or Chief Data Officers. These trends are normal every time an industry goes through a massive change,” said Amit Das, chief executive officer and co-founder of Think360.ai, a Mumbai-based data science company.  “In a way, with the growth of fintechs, banks are aspiring to become savvier, and the advent of transformative technologies like AI (artificial intelligence) will force these realignments.”  Das’ views were corroborated by Kotak Mahindra Bank’s first chief technology officer, Milind Nagnur. In an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol on September 14, Nagnur spoke of an important shift — that of viewing the bank as a software engineering-focused organisation. In his view, the new definition of trust in banking for customers is not about the safety of assets, but about how dependable a bank’s digital offerings are.    Are banks worried?  According to bankers, the rise of fintechs has indeed revolutionised the lending industry, with most traditional banks trying to catch up with fintechs. If anything, fintech lending has only threatened the ‘traditional’ way of banking and lending, which is good for customers and the market. However, it is too nascent to say that they could replace banks altogether, they added.  Banks have superior funding franchises, arguably more underwriting expertise, and a widespread distribution or collection network that is also becoming a lot more digital. Fintech companies have better technology capabilities, user interfaces, and innovative solutions.  According to industry players, both banks and fintech companies have realised the advantages the other offers and have come together to offer comprehensive solutions.  “Over the decade, especially after the start of the pandemic, it has been clearly proven that fintechs and banks have a collaborative relationship rather than a competitive one,” said Murali Ramakrishnan, managing director and chief executive officer at South Indian Bank.  “I feel that fintechs will continue to have the role of an enabler rather than a competitor. Even with banks’ legacy infrastructural gaps, they do have a firmly established long-term client base that is unlikely for fintechs to replace,” Ramakrishnan added.  According to Akhil Handa, chief digital officer at Bank of Baroda, while technological advances are not new to finance, digital innovation has brought major improvements in the connectivity of systems, in computing power and cost, and in newly created and usable data. These improvements have alleviated transaction costs and given rise to new business models and new entrants like fintechs.  “Fintechs have demonstrated that they can transform the financial-landscape, where consumers get to choose from a larger set of options at competitive prices and build efficiency through lower operational costs,” said Handa. “Banks may have lost some customers to mobile fintech applications, but this has also created an opportunity like never before for banking institutions and inspired them to embrace change.”  Also read: Fintechs need to ‘live' compliance, knowing regulations is not enough: Axis Bank MD &amp;amp; CEO Amitabh Chaudhry  Large unbanked population  Another reason why there is a tremendous opportunity for both players to survive in this landscape is the large number of unbanked Indians. Around 200 million Indians are unbanked, according to the Global Findex Database –2021. That’s quite a large number for both fintechs and banks to tap into.  “In India, we have enormous unmet demand for credit and enough space for many players. So, thinking that fintechs are eating into banks’ business is rather odd,” said Sugandh Saxena, chief executive officer at the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE).  Saxena added that most traditional banks are trying to catch up with fintechs, which only pose a threat to the ‘traditional’ way of banking. Banks in India have capital, scale, credibility and a much larger mandate, he added.  Bank of Baroda’s Handa said that while there has been increased competition from fintechs in the last few years in segments like payments and lending, banks have taken on this challenge as an opportunity.  Fintechs, according to Handa, have to an extent inspired banks to make product delivery seamless and on the go. Banks are delivering products with enhanced user experience and have made customers transition back to using the products and services of incumbents, he said. Rather than fear, he feels it is “healthy competition” between two entities striving to constantly push each other to serve their clientele better every day.  Can fintechs replace banks?  For a while back in 2021, the question often asked was: will fintechs be a threat to banks? Today, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has left no one in doubt about the answer, going by the slew of circulars that it has issued to rein in fintechs.    “The RBI seems hell-bent on regulating fintechs through banks or NBFCs (non-banking finance companies), and hence our models will have to evolve around that,” said a fintech founder, on condition of anonymity. “Our wings are clipped, so we have to depend on banks and NBFCs for survival. With the kind of regulations that the RBI has brought in, it is impossible for fintechs to replace banks altogether.”  According to Rajat Deshpande, chief executive officer and co-founder of FinBox, the plan for legacy players—banks and NBFCs—looks like this: improve your technology stack, partner with fintechs where you can’t build it yourself, and convert the entire suite of offerings into a digital-first business where the cost of delivery is lower.  This way, there’s much more potential to increase revenue per customer, said Deshpande. Direct acquisition of customers, added Deshpande, is becoming increasingly expensive and hence eats into margins quickly.  However, some bankers said that while banks’ cost of spending on digital transformation has increased, the costs may be plateauing.  “I think we are plateauing; 50 percent is at an aggregate level. At an aggregate level we are clearly seeing a plateauing of costs already,” said Parag Rao, group head – payments, consumer finance, technology and digital marketing at HDFC Bank at the launch of the SmartHub Vyapar app.  The way forward: collaboration or confrontation?  At least seven bankers and fintechs Moneycontrol spoke to said that collaboration, and not competition, is the way forward. Rather than competing with each other, it would be best for fintechs and banks to identify each other’s strengths and play the market together, added industry players.  “It's no longer going to be an 'us versus them'. Banks and fintechs have both realised that they accomplish more when they are collaborating, instead of competing,” said Srikanth Mopidevi, managing director and head of technology at DBS Bank India. “By working in tandem, banks are able to provide customer-friendly technology, while fintechs benefit from the large-scale network and customer data available with the banks.”  The next few years, Mopidevi said, will see a host of new collaborations expected to further improve the banking experience. Bank-fintech partnerships have especially enabled smaller banks to innovate and become competitive. However, fintechs will complement and enhance the existing banking landscape and not replace it, he added.  HDFC Bank’s Rao concurred with Mopidevi’s view. Rao said that he believes “very strongly” in the partnership philosophy and that the bank is open to more partnerships with fintech players.  Fintech players, too, believe that the partnership model will work well for both sides. “We believe that neo-banks and traditional Banks can work together to increase the size of the pie and play off each other’s strengths,” said Kunal Varma, co-founder and CEO of Freo, a consumer neobank. “This would lead to a win for the consumer, reduction in costs, and rapid market expansion with sustainable profit pools for the industry.”  This trend is currently visible. In September, Axis Bank partnered with fintech firm PayNearby to launch savings and current accounts for last-mile merchants. IDBI Bank has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Vay Network Services as its first fintech partner for digital supply chain finance solutions (e-SCF). There are many such examples.  According to the EY report cited earlier, collaborations between traditional financial services players such as banks with fintech startups is “business as usual” now and enabled by the proliferation of APIs (application programming interfaces, which allow myriad software types to communicate with each other) and data sharing norms.  With limited new licences, fintech startups only have the partnership route to go to market, and that is being welcomed by banks, the report said.

According to Morgan Stanley’s latest report co-authored by Jonathan Garner, emerging markets (EMs) first got into trouble in February 2021. That means, we are almost 600 days into this bear market. On an average, a bear market lasts only 289 days.  Morgan Stanley also believes that the peak-to-trough move of -40 percent is greater than the average. In 2001, during the dotcom bust, the peak-to-trough move took 589 days, while this time it has taken 590 days.  Light at the end of tunnel  After this long stretch of loss, the global brokerage now believes that emerging markets and Asia are close to the end. The bear-market cycle will be over soon and it is time to &quot;plant saplings for next cycle&quot; as &quot;a lot of the wood has been chopped.&quot;  Investors should &quot;rotate towards proven early-cycle beneficiaries,&quot; Garner and his colleagues said, and upgraded Korea and Taiwan equities to Buy.

For Morgan Stanley’s own MSCI Emerging Market index, it is 1,000.  What’s the view on India?  The firm is Underweight on Indian equities. According to them, Indonesia, Singapore, and India’s economies are fundamentally sound on macros but are still expensive. “Since Indian markets have relatively outperformed in 2022, it might ultimately lag in the Emerging Market rebound,” the report stated. The Nifty is down only 1.7 percent this year so far, while the MSCI EM index is down 35 percent.  The Indian market has been downgraded to accommodate their Overweight upgrades of Korea and Taiwan.

Deposit growth has also been strong","Banks’ provisional business updates for the July-September quarter suggest that loan and deposit growth continues to be robust.  Banking analysts and industry experts said the trend is likely to continue even in the upcoming quarters, despite worsening global macro headwinds and the central bank’s tightening monetary policy regime.  “Over the medium term, a well-capitalised balance sheet, improving loan growth and lower credit cost forecast are positive catalysts that should allow valuation multiples to improve as macro stability returns,” said Nilanjan Karfa, an analyst at brokerage house Nomura.  In this context, three narratives—banks’ current account savings account (CASA)-dominant compounding franchises, earnings geared to growth, and lower credit cost—will likely play out, said Karfa.  Also read: Bank lending rates set to rise further on expected RBI tightening, say experts  Numbers game  Banks’ July-September business updates paint a rosy picture for the sector. Top banks, including State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank, have reported a double-digit increase in loan growth for the July-September quarter on a year-on-year basis. Deposit growth has also been strong.  HDFC Bank, for instance, reported a 23.5 percent increase in loans and advances year on year in the July-September quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, loan growth increased by just over 6 percent. The deposit base grew 19.5 percent on-year.  IndusInd Bank, too, said its advances rose 17.6 percent and 4.7 percent on a yearly and quarterly basis, respectively. Deposits grew at 13.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.  State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, said its advances stood at Rs 67,981 crore in the fiscal second quarter, up 16.6 percent on a year-on-year basis and just over 5 percent on a quarterly basis. Deposits were at Rs 88,503 crore, up 1.9 percent year on year.  Relatively smaller peers Federal Bank, Bank of Maharashtra and Karur Vysya Bank reported a similar trend as seen in the chart below.    Not just banks, mortgage lender HDFC was also party to the trend. HDFC’s assigned loans stood at Rs 9,145 crore in the July-September quarter, up 28.2 percent on a year-on-year basis. Individual loans sold were at Rs 34,513 crore, up about 27 percent on a year-on-year basis.  What’s driving loan growth?  Indian banks are recovering from the COVID-19 crisis, which rendered many Indians jobless. Now that the economy is recovering, credit offtake has improved significantly. According to RBI data, bank credit registered a yearly growth of 16 percent in August. Also, the July-September quarter numbers come on the back of a low base.  Now that the festive season is around the corner, analysts expect banks to capitalise on higher spending and report healthy credit growth in the upcoming quarters as well.  “We expect strong (credit) growth for banks. System credit is at 16 percent, this is likely to translate into strong growth for banks,” said Hemali Dhame, associate vice president–research, at Kotak Securities. “There has been better credit utilisation driven by MSMEs, strong personal loan growth, credit cards and housing.”  “We expect festive season credit growth to be healthy, too. We expect healthy credit growth trends for the year,” added Dhame.  According to Punit Patni, an analyst at Swastika Investmart, a rise in spending, the opening up of the economy as the coronavirus pandemic eases, strong housing and real estate demand, government spending, the thrust on infrastructure, and high capacity utilisation levels are some of the reasons that explain the improved credit growth.  “Following the normalisation of COVID effects, the banking sector is experiencing positive growth momentum, which is expected to last for the next few quarters,” added Patni. “The impending festival season will be the icing on the cake as retail spending and credit demand remain strong.”  Credit demand is expected to stay robust despite four successive rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said analysts. The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has increased rates by 190 basis points since May to quell inflationary pressure . Rate cues from the RBI are transmitted in the banking system when lenders adjust their lending and deposit rates.  Moneycontrol reported on October 3 that even though lending rates are edging higher, bankers and analysts do not expect the rate hike cycle to curb demand for loans.  Also read: Banks’ loan book to grow 14-15% YoY in FY23; GNPAs seen at 5% by March end, analysts say  Deposit mobilisation to continue  To fund the credit growth, analysts expect banks to mobilise deposits, especially in the wake of banking surplus liquidity tightening at a faster pace.  Already, lenders such as Axis Bank, DCB Bank, ICICI Bank and RBL Bank have increased fixed deposit (FD) rates following the RBI rate hike. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, in his post-policy briefing, said there would be more traction with regard to the adjustment of deposit rates, going forward.  “We expect a rate war sort of situation to mobilise deposits, especially in the mid- and small-sized banking segment,” said Swastika Investmart’s Patni. “However, banks with high CASA share, high liquidity coverage, and low credit-to-deposit ratios are better positioned to navigate the upcoming liquidity dearth.”  Kotak Securities’ Dhame concurred with Patni. “Deposit mobilisation is likely to be the way forward,” she said. Banks have raised deposit rates since the rate hike cycle has begun but not commensurate with the hikes in repo.

","Analyst optimism lingered mostly around banks and financials as of September-end as credit growth peaked at as high as 16 percent and the condition of the Indian economy improved post-pandemic.  Data available with Bloomberg showed that most of the analyst optimism – measured as the percentage of analysts that have a ‘buy’ call on a stock – was centered around ICICI Bank, Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;T), and ITC among others.  ICICI Bank, which is one of the best performing bank stocks right now, has 52 ‘buy’ calls and just one ‘hold’ call, translating into an optimism score of 98 percent. The company has been delivering expectation-beating earnings for a while now and has become the apple of analysts’ eye. Analysts have praised its top-of-the-class net interest margins and investments into technology that is reaping rewards now.  L&amp;amp;T also has an optimism score of 98 percent with 40 ‘buy’ calls and a solitary ‘sell’ call. The stock is regarded as the best play on the infrastructure boom in India. The company is building some of the most important projects in the country including the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train project. It also has maintained its run rate of fresh orders resulting in revenue visibility, analysts underline.  Cigarette maker ITC is also one of analysts' top favourites with an optimism score of 97 percent. As many as 35 analysts are bullish on the stock with one analyst with a ‘hold’ call. The stock is also one of the best blue-chip performers of the current calendar year with returns of 51 percent.  Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and State Bank of India (SBI) are two more stocks in the financial space that have the same optimism score – 96 percent. HDFC – the largest mortgage lender in India – is in process of merging with HDFC Bank which analysts  believe will be value accretive. Hence, the stock has also attracted investors. Meanwhile, SBI which is the largest bank in the country is riding on a high credit growth phase and relatively cheaper valuations.  Two top life insurers – SBI Life Insurance and HDFC Life Insurance – are the next two stocks where optimism is high. Insurance penetration in India remains very low and it is likely to go up as awareness increases. Analysts are banking on this trend and are bullish on these stocks.  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, UPL, and NTPC are others in the top 10 where analysts are most bullish. Analysts believe Sun Pharma is likely to gain from ramping up sales in the US. It will also benefit from rupee depreciation. NTPC is investing heavily in new energy which will become another source of revenue for the firm and hence grabbed attention.  IT, metals continue to face flak For another month, metals and IT sectors remained the pockets where analysts were not as bullish. JSW Steel, Wipro and Shree Cement were among the top stocks where the pessimism score was the highest. Pessimism score refers to the percentage of analysts that are not bullish on a stock.  JSW Steel, which is a victim of rich valuation and declining metal prices, has 17 ‘sell’ calls and 9 ‘hold’ calls compared to 7 ‘buy’ calls. The steelmaker is also likely to face a slowdown in export sales as western countries will be under recessionary pressure that will lead to fall in demand.  Wipro, along with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies, are IT stocks that are part of this list. IT companies, being export-facing, are also bearing the brunt of the slowdown in Europe and the US. Any recessionary phase leads to lesser tech spending and hence analysts have cut down their expectations.  Besides them, FMCG majors Britannia Industries and Nestle India are others that are seeing a concentration of pessimism. Both companies have been struggling with a slowdown in demand in rural India, which is likely to become even more challenging as kharif sowing has been lower than expectations. That means rural income is likely to be lower going ahead. Rich valuations of both stocks is also playing spoilsport for them.

He said he prefers ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and SBI among them. He is also positive on NBFCs like Chola Finance.","The rally in the recent month has been broad-based. In fact, many pockets of the broader market have performed a lot better than the largecaps. However, this hasn’t come as a surprise for analysts.  Varun Lohchab, head of institutional research at HDFC Securities, is one of those analysts who believe the rally in the broader market may continue given the recovery in the Indian economy.  Mid- and small-caps are more exposed to how the economy does. As things get better on the economic front, we believe mid- and small-caps will do well. Even in terms of valuations, we are seeing better opportunities in select mid- and small-caps compared to large-caps,” said Lohchab, speaking with CNBC TV-18 on September 8.  He added that HDFC Securities is positive on the Indian economy from a 12 to 18 month view.  His optimism comes at a time when major western economies are likely to enter a recession due to the fallout of war in Ukraine. The market in those countries has already sensed the doom and the selling has deepened. Meanwhile, the Indian market has outperformed them by a wide margin.  However, this unchecked rally has made headline indices more expensive than others. Nifty currently trades at a trailing PE of 22 times and 1-year forward PE of 20.56. This is about double of how Hong Kong and Taiwan trade. It is also significantly more expensive than Jakarta, US and Japan that trade in the range of 15-17 times their 1-year forward PE.  “At an index level we don't see a runaway sort of opportunity given the fact it's already trading at 21-22 times,” said Lohchab, highlighting his concerns that the index may not rise much from hereon.  Lohchab said he is positive on large banks, echoing many others including those at Morgan Stanley that rerated the entire banking sector earlier this week. He said he prefers ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and SBI among them. He is also positive on NBFCs like Chola Finance.  Lohchab is also banking on private capex that he believes will likely grow and surprise on the positive side through FY25. “So from that perspective, we are positive on Siemens, GR Infra, KNR Constructions and NCC,” he said.  He believes mild recession in other parts should work in India’s favour but a deeper recession will mean lower export and may be detrimental for the country’s economy.

icici,2022-09-08T13:02:16+05:30,Gaurav Sharma,"Industrials, financials, discretionary to gain on capex boom: Morgan Stanley","Given the perception that growth may be accelerating, led by investments, the domestic cyclical sectors could gain, the global investment bank has said","India's coming capital expenditure cycle implies that the country is in the midst of a strong earnings cycle with positive implications for industrial and financial stocks, global investment bank Morgan Stanley has said.  The confidence stems from an improving trend in corporate and financial sector balance sheets, along with a strong reform push by the government, Morgan Stanley said in a recent report.  The fact that India’s corporate debt-to-GDP ratio is at a 15-year low and impaired loans in the banking sector are at a 10-year low makes a strong case for a likely surge in investments to strengthen supplies.  “We believe that India will see a new capex cycle changing the growth dynamics and fostering a virtuous cycle of productive growth and we see both the supply side and demand side factors favouring the onset of a new capex cycle,” the report said.  The investment bank is also seeing nascent signs of improvement in high-frequency data.  What will drive the capex?   Supply-side factors   A number of factors are seen in play for the revival of private sector capex. These include cyclical improvement in demand and capacity utilisation, cleaner corporate and financial sector balance sheets, structural reforms such as corporate tax rate reduction, implementation of Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes and focus on infrastructure and supply-chain diversification.  The corporate sector continues to deleverage its balance sheets with “the corporate debt to GDP ratio expected at 47 percent in FY23 from a peak of 62 percent in FY15”,  Morgan Stanley added.  It expects the corporate debt growth to surpass nominal GDP growth in FY24 after staying below it in the past nine years.  The banking sector's balance sheet position between FY10 to FY18 was constrained as impaired loans continued to increase, peaking at 12.4 percent of bank assets in FY18.  “Impaired loans have now decelerated to a 10-year low of 7.5 percent in FY22, indicating an improving balance sheet position to fund the capex cycle,” said Morgan Stanley.  It is also seeing an inflection in credit growth with better domestic demand. Year-to-date credit is growing at one of the highest rates in 10 years. Year-on-year (YoY) credit growth was 15.3 percent as of August 22, partly because of a low base.  However, “we note that trailing three-year credit growth has accelerated to 8.7 percent as against 6.8 percent as of end March 2022 and retail/SME demand has resumed and capacity utilisation has improved which has led to normalization of loan growth at Indian banks.”  Also read: Morgan Stanley rerates banking sector, sees 41% upside in select stocks  The government has shown strong intent to push structural reforms. The policy reforms have been meaningful, starting with the significant reduction in the corporate tax rate, the introduction of fiscal incentives under the PLI schemes for the manufacturing sector, expansion of public infrastructure spending and opening up of new sectors for private businesses.  The recent spate of supply-chain disruptions in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and geopolitical tensions have brought to the fore the vagaries of dependence on a few sources of supply. Global companies are making a shift toward a &quot;China plus&quot; strategy to reduce their dependence on that country and India is one of the biggest potential beneficiaries of the shift.  “Indeed, we are seeing signs of improvement in foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, multinational corporation (MNC) sentiment and more news flow suggesting India should benefit from relocation of supply chains,” the investment bank added.  It expects India’s export market share to more than double to 4.5 percent by 2030 from 2.2 percent currently.  Demand-side factors   After the pandemic brought the global economy to a standstill, the complete reopening of the economy is enabling a strong recovery in India.  The recovery has been the strongest in almost a decade. “It is the breadth of the recovery where we are seeing growth firing on almost all cylinders, which is very encouraging,” said the report.  The strength of the economy can also be gauged from the improvement in key economic indicators like the Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) and a surge in Goods and Services Tax collections.  Growth in car and two- wheeler sales compared to pre-COVID levels has been more than 30 percent each, new property sales and launches have reached 11- and 8-year highs respectively and capacity utilisation rose to 75.3 percent in the first quarter of the current financial year.  According to Morgan Stanley’s proprietary MNC Sentiment Index, which has a strong association with FDI inflows, corporate profits and the direction of share prices, the sentiment towards India is close to all-time highs.  “Relative to China, where we run a similar index, India took its outperformance to an all-time high,” it added.  The report stated that from a geographical perspective, the improvement in sentiment was led by the US and Japan. From a sector perspective, real estate, materials, communication services and industrials outperformed, whereas energy, utilities and consumer staples and technology were the laggards.  Also read: FPIs park record $6.5 billion in Indian equities in August, financials beat FMCG this month  Economic outlook   The investment bank estimates that the overall investment rate will rise to 36 percent of GDP by FY27 from around 31 percent of GDP in FY22. This implies that total investment growth (nominal) will average around 16.7 percent in the next five years compared to average growth of 8.8 percent in the previous five years.  Risks to the banks’ outlook emerge from external factors such as a sharper-than-anticipated slowdown in global growth and or a sharp rise in commodity prices, particularly oil prices, which can impact business confidence.  Corporate profits still have steam left to go grow for the next few years. The most important ingredient in profits is the rate of investment. In turn, higher profits drive investments, creating a virtuous cycle of higher wages, more consumption, more investments and more profits.  “The profit cycle breaks when investments start getting unproductive or &quot;excessive&quot; but that point is a few years away,” said the investment bank. “As investments rise, profit share in GDP (aka profit margin) will likely go past its previous high which means Indian stocks are not as rich as they appear on a headline basis.”  Catch all the market action on our live blog  Sectors and stocks   Given the perception that growth may be accelerating, led by investments, Morgan Stanley thinks domestic cyclical sectors could do well relative to external-facing sectors or defensive ones.  “Accordingly, we prefer industrials, financials and consumer discretionary. We are also overweight on these sectors in our sector model portfolio with a 12-18 month view,” it said.  Industrials are likely benefiting from strong capex plus inexpensive valuations, while for financials, rising interest rates support margins, low leverage levels in the economy and rising capex favour a loan boom and benign credit costs further boost earnings.  Consumer discretionary valuations look attractive, given expectations of strong growth in the coming months. Long-term fundamentals are robust, underpinned by rising incomes.  Among the stocks, the investment bank’s top picks are Hindustan Aeronautics, L&amp;amp;T and Bharat Electronics in the EPC (erection, procurement and construction) and capital goods segments.  It expects a few industrial goods companies like Havells, Voltas, Astral and Kajaria to benefit from improving real estate cycle and rising electrification.  In the financial space, it believes that retail deposits and competitive intensity will be high, and the ability to gain deposit market share gains will be the key. Large banks like ICICI Bank and State Bank of India are best placed to capitalize on this.

ICICI Bank and ITC – two of the Street favourites in recent months given how much they have rallied – followed with all but one analyst having a ‘buy’ rating on them.  Since mid-June, L&amp;amp;T has rallied 31 percent. The company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the government's thrust on improving public infrastructure in the country. As of June-end, the consolidated order book of the group was at a record Rs 3,63,448 crore, with international orders having a share of 28 percent.  ICICI Bank, which is arguably the best performing large private bank, continues to hold a favourable position among analysts. Out of 53 analysts who track the stock, 52 have BUY calls while one has 'hold' call, the data shows. The stock has also delivered 27 percent since mid-June when the market had hit a recent low.  ITC, which is on a dream run since February, is the third most favourite stock among analysts with just one of 37 analysts having a 'hold' rating while others advising to 'buy' the stock. ITC is the cheapest available FMCG stock and the company has seen a strong growth in revenue. The outlook for its hotel, and paper businesses have also improved.  HDFC, which is in process to merge with HDFC Bank, and SBI are the next two stocks where analysts see value emerging. The former is the largest mortgage lender whose merger is likely to be value accretive, according to money managers and analysts. Whereas the latter is the largest banking entity in India that many analysts believe is undervalued. Both these stocks are also beneficiaries of increased credit growth in recent quarters.  SBI Life Insurance Co, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, UPL, NTPC and Apollo Hospitals Enterprise are the next five names where analysts are overwhelmingly positive.  SBI Life delivered strong growth in June quarter. Analysts say the company has diverse distribution network, has been investing in technology which provides a robust base to ensure steady growth. On the other hand, Sun Pharma is attracting analysts thanks to its growth in speciality segment. NTPC has been adding capacity in not just traditional sources but also in solar, which will likely to reap rewards going ahead.  Analysts are positive on Apollo Hospitals as they see its superior positioning in the pharmacy segment through and enhanced outlook for healthcare services segment to work for the stock.  IT remains out of favour JSW Steel continues to have a high number of 'sell' and 'hold' calls – 16 and 9, respectively – as analysts find it to be overvalued, especially given the diminishing growth avenues for the steel sector. International metal prices are down 30-40 percent from their peak, which means steel companies are getting lesser revenue on selling the same amount of steel.  Sector-wise, IT has the largest representation among those stocks where analysts are most pessimistic. As many as three names from the sector – Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Technologies – are in the top 10 list. Analysts have turned cautious on the IT sector, fearing recession in their key western markets and declining margins for the last couple of quarters. Shares of IT companies have also seen heavy selling in recent months partly due to these reasons and in part due to global sell-off in technology stocks.  Similarly, analysts continue to be pessimistic about FMCG majors Britannia Industries and Nestle India. They believe them to be overvalued stocks. Both these firms have also struggled to grow in rural markets in recent quarters. Now the monsoon has been erratic, and with lower sowing rural income will likely be affected. This may add further to the woes of Britannia and Nestle in rural market.  Shree Cement and Asian Paints – two names serving the infra sector – have been facing declining margins, especially when raw material prices have been a concern. Though to be fair, some of these concerns have abated but analysts maintain their cautious stance on the stock.  Both names have also been facing pressure from new entrants in their respective industries, which may lead to lower margins for some time as competition will intensify, say analysts.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/l-pessimism-centres-around-it-fmcg-9131431.html
icici,2022-08-29T11:32:45+05:30,Priyanka Iyer,"MC Investigation | Indian banks' repeated failures on mobile, internet platforms show the rot runs deep","Core banking systems that can't keep pace with rising load and fast digital changes, lack of an adequate number of talented tech professionals, and reluctance to invest in infrastructure for unremunerative UPI mean more system outages and glitches. ","Wonder why your bank's system is down quite often or why you face transaction declines repeatedly?  A Moneycontrol investigation into tech glitches reported by Indian banks across multiple platforms — mobile and internet — over the last few years has revealed major fundamental problems in their operations.  For one, most banks, including bigger ones, continue to use outdated technology platforms, making upgrades difficult. Secondly, these banks severely lack the adequate number of talented tech professionals to support large-scale tech-enabled banking operations, often resulting in major delays in the event of an outage.  Moneycontrol studied the tech outages reported by at least six banks in the recent past and spoke to at least 10 officials from these banks and technology firms.  Rising customer complaints  According to the central bank’s 2021 ombudsman scheme annual report, customers submitted a total of 44,385 complaints related to mobile and electronic banking between April 2020 and March 2021, higher than the 41,310 complaints recorded by the regulator in the previous year.  This is at a time when banks continue to launch new digital initiatives and so-called super apps.  To give an example, on June 30, a Twitter user posted a “maintenance” break screenshot from State Bank of India’s (SBI) banking application YONO. He complained that the bank had shared no communication with customers to alert them of the service outage.  As per the screenshot, the app’s services were not supposed to be available till 7 pm on June 30.  “19:00 hours already passed…,” Verma replied to his original tweet after the maintenance break passed its deadline. The same day saw many similar complaints by users saying that India’s largest public sector bank had not sent any prior notice for the scheduled break at a time when the country is pushing for further digitisation.   Source: Twitter  SBI is not the only one facing heat for such issues. On August 17, multiple Twitter users posted complaints of not being able to log into the bank website or app of India’s largest private sector bank – HDFC Bank. Similarly on August 13, many complained that net banking was not working since morning that day.  @HDFC_Bank your netbanking site not working from today morning, please check and resolve the problem — Satish Kumar (@SatishKRoy1976) August 13, 2022   “@HDFC_Bank your netbanking is down since an hour. I have payments to make and your site is just not working. Is it down for maintenance? If yes, no email or messages or any prior intimation was given to me,” tweeted user Ishita Shah.  Last year, the bank faced the wrath of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) after five major outages between November 2018 and March 2021. While RBI lifted the ban on all launches of its upcoming digital business-generating activities later, RBI’s diktat set the bank behind in competing with its peer ICICI Bank in credit card issuances as well as new digital initiatives.  Both SBI and HDFC Bank did not respond to detailed queries by Moneycontrol on the scheduled maintenance break or on the service outage.  Twitter is full of similar complaints across banks -- multiple users facing problems at once on some days.  What is the core issue?  The biggest strength of India’s largest banks is also the biggest Achilles' heel when it comes to technology – scale. Besides the burden on internal tech systems to handle the rising volumes of digital transactions, these are legacy systems with a heavy dependence on external service providers that plug in each layer of tech for banks.  “The large banks have the issue of using legacy technology from years ago. The bigger you are, the more difficult it is to upgrade. The risk is immense even while migrating from a large old database to a new one,” said the technology head of a leading fintech.  The core banking system of most banks is provided by large information technology players, including Infosys’ Finacle, Oracle and BaNCS by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). With the core system being operated by tech teams of these IT giants, internal teams of most banks only ensure that these systems are kept up and running.  “In one of our conversations with a smaller private bank that positioned itself as a digital bank, we were told that they have a tech team of 400 people. But not a single one of them wrote any code. Their entire job was to deal with their IT vendors,” the person added.  In such a situation, many experts believe that internal bank teams are largely deployed for ‘requirement management’ and not equipped to fix larger issues or build for evolving needs of customers.    Legacy problems  Aishwarya Jaishankar, who has led digital initiatives at various private sector banks and is now Co-Founder of Hyperface which provides tech stack for credit cards, said, “The core banking systems were built for the back offices and branches of banks and have scaled from there. But now modern customers want to be served digitally, needing a front-end focussed experience that banks are struggling to create with pure-play core banking systems.”  The core banking systems too are legacy software built over the past two decades and have reached a scale that makes it difficult to upgrade these to handle the increasing volumes. Hence, the knowledge required to operate these systems too is similar to what was required years ago.  Harshavardhan Godugula, Partner, Forensic and Integrity Services, EY, said, “Traditionally, core banking platforms are centralised systems – on top of which banks have built newer applications and capabilities, such as mobile banking, Unified Payments Interface (UPI), etc. Sometimes, these legacy systems are unable to perform adequately and face system downtime, vulnerabilities, hardware failures, etc. If banking apps are not built and tested properly, they are bound to throw back errors.”  Another disadvantage for large legacy banks is the difficulty in attracting the right talent and pay disparity as compared to large IT players and startups. “Large financial institutions have a hierarchical structure that makes decision-making difficult,” said another fintech founder.  Hyperface’s Jaishankar added, “While core banking is resilient, it has not evolved at the rate that innovation has taken place. Banks have to plug more third-party switches into the existing systems as the usage of real-time payments and other innovations increase pressure on the system.”  Nilufer Mullanfiroze, who has over two decades of experience working with banks like Standard Chartered and Federal Bank and is now Head of Banking at investment startup Groww argued that the time for technology to become redundant is only becoming shorter. Hence, it is not practical to expect large institutions to redo their systems.  &quot;But what needs to be the practical approach with most banks is to have the right infrastructure to build things on top of their core banking systems. Having the agility to be able to use the core banking system more as the backend system and build the right interfaces with newer age technology is the way to go for the future,&quot; she added.  The tide, however, has changed for the better after the regulator took cognisance of major outages across banks. Top management across banks are now more aware of the limitations of their technical capacities and seem to be working with the regulator around challenges.  Finally, the UPI hiccup…  “Since the last few days, when we try to send or receive money through UPI apps, the SBI server is down very often. Nowadays, people carry very less cash in hand. How are we supposed to transact seamlessly in such a scenario,” Sanket Rathi, an SBI customer for more than 10 years told Moneycontrol.  Failures on UPI payment systems are basically of two types, technical decline (TD) and business decline (BD). Technical declines are caused due to issues with the bank's system or NPCI systems, while business declines are caused due to issues pertaining to customers, such as incorrect PINs or transactions beyond stipulated limits.  “If we compare TDs to BDs, the former is always lesser than the latter. This is a clear result of seamlessness,” Venkatraman Venkateswaran, chief financial officer (CFO) at Federal Bank said.  To counter issues relating to reconciliation of timed out and declined transactions on the UPI platform, we might soon see the emergence of a tech that will allow real-time settlement of such transactions, he added.  Numbers don’t lie  The top five UPI remitter banks in terms of volumes in July were SBI, HDFC Bank, Bank of Baroda, Union Bank and ICICI Bank. For example, SBI's approval rate of UPI transactions was at 92.1 percent in July. The bank’s business decline rate stood at 7.26 percent as compared to 6.96 percent in June. The technical decline rate saw a steep drop to 0.68 percent in July from over 5 percent in June.  While the decline rates keep fluctuating every month, for the user dependent on UPI for all transactions, this is a major road bump. So why do UPI downtimes happen with banks?  Banks as well as the RBI have taken cognisance of the burden that the rise in UPI transactions has put on bank servers. Since the pandemic struck in March 2020, UPI monthly transaction values have grown by 5x from Rs 2 lakh crore to Rs 10.62 lakh crore in July 2022. What’s more is that UPI is used for multiple small-ticket transactions, including paying for an auto ride or even your local tea stall owner.  With over 600 crore transactions a month, the stress on bank servers is high.  “To add to that, the innovation is happening faster than the time banks can take to handle the growing transactions. With RuPay credit cards on UPI and UPI 123Pay, the number of transactions is expected to grow significantly,” said a senior executive of a payments company.    So, what are banks doing to address these problems?  Large banks are working towards pre-empting the problems that may emerge in the coming years as digital adoption increases further.  “While other private banks are trying to get their house in order, ICICI Bank is preparing for a wider presence in getting embedded across a large number of platforms where users transact. It is also preparing to scale horizontally and vertically,” said the founder of a fintech and bank infrastructure provider.  ICICI Bank did not respond to Moneycontrol’s request to participate in the story.  HDFC Bank chief executive officer Sashidhar Jagdishan, in a mail to employees in April 2021, had said that the bank has invested heavily in scaling up the infrastructure to handle any potential load that it will encounter for the next three to five years.  The bank is also setting up a digital factory and an enterprise factory to roll out new digital offerings and to help augment the bank’s IT infrastructure.  As for SBI, multiple reports suggest that the bank is in the process of upgrading its YONO app to offer a completely digital banking offering.  Another outlier is Federal Bank. The bank is known to invest heavily in modernising its internal tech capabilities, cloud adoption as well as target growth through tie-ups with fintechs. As per, customers are extensively using the bank’s internet banking platform due to the constant investments it has made.  “The enterprise or individual of today doesn't want to experience buffering pages. The 'lift and shift' model (migrating apps and data to cloud) of ensuring early adoption of tech will ensure that the sector is near glitch-free,” Federal Bank’s Venkateswaran said.  Union Bank of India General Manager Sanjay Narayan, who leads the lender’s digital initiatives, said that the lender has put in place a board-approved compensation policy whereby the bank compensates the customer for any financial loss that they may incur due to deficiency in service on the part of the bank, or any act of omission or commission directly attributable to the bank.  “With the growing customer base and increase in the number of digital products, robust infrastructure is a must. Adding new hardware to accommodate the continuous increase in digital transactions and customer base has become one of the important aspects of providing hassle-free banking services. Cloud is one of the growing spaces being used by entities for expansion of infrastructure,” Narayan said.  The UPI puzzle — To invest or not?  On UPI, industry experts have pointed out that banks see less incentive in investing further for UPI transactions as payment systems don't fetch enough revenues for banks and payment service providers, as per government norms.  “UPI has also introduced an orchestration approach due to its scale, something that was rarely conspicuous in the Indian banking system. But ensuring scalability with the right agility and security has its own costs. Government incentive will be helpful to take care of some of the costs associated with UPI,” Venkateswaran said.  In December 2021, the government had announced a Rs 1,300 crore scheme to incentivise banks, and through them payment gateways and UPI players for transactions. To be eligible for the full incentive, banks were required to show at least 50 percent year-on-year growth in UPI transactions by the end of the last quarter of the scheme.  With the Union Ministry of Finance’s recent clarification that the government has no plans to levy charges on UPI transactions, CRISIL Research Director Aniket Dani said that further government incentives in promoting UPI will aid in the upgradation of the existing services.  “The Ministry of Finance asserted on August 22 that would continue lending financial support to boost the digital payments ecosystem in the country. This help from the government will, in turn, aid the parties in the transaction to get monetary remuneration for the probable expenses associated with the same,” Dani said.  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/mc-investigation-indian-banks-repeated-failures-on-mobile-internet-platforms-show-the-rot-runs-deep-9100191.html

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increased the key policy repo rate — at which it lends short-term money to banks — by a steep 50 basis points or 0.5 per cent to a three-year high of 5.40 per cent to tame high inflation.  Retail inflation has remained stubbornly high at over 6 per cent for more than the past six months in a row.

State-owned Punjab National Bank (PNB) also raised the repo, the external benchmark, linked lending rate to 7.90 per cent.  &quot;Consequent upon an increase in repo rate by RBI, the Repo Linked Lending Rate (RLLR) has been revised from 7.40 per cent to 7.90 per cent with effect from August 8, 2022,&quot; PNB said in a regulatory filing. Earlier this month, ICICI Bank also revised the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 0.15 per cent across all tenors ahead of the RBI policy rate announcement.  A report by an internal study group of the RBI in 2017 said the internal benchmark rates like base rates or MCLRs were not delivering effective transmission of the monetary policy repo rate decisions of the central bank. It then recommended switchover to an external benchmark. Subsequently, all new floating rate personal and retail loans (housing, auto), and floating rate loans to Micro and Small Enterprises by banks were linked to an external benchmark (repo) from October 1, 2019.  Banks can take the external benchmark as the RBI's repo rate or the government's treasury bill-based yields published by the Financial Benchmarks India Private Ltd (FBIL) or any other benchmark market interest rate published by FBIL. The lenders are free to decide the spread over the external benchmark as well as to offer such external benchmark-linked loans to other types of borrowers as well.  As per the RBI directions, the interest rate under the external benchmark is supposed to be reset at least once in three months.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/icici-bank-pnb-hike-external-benchmark-based-lending-rates-8963581.html

icici,2022-07-26T13:06:53+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"Bullish on banking stocks, Hiren Ved says market corrections are over",Alchemy Capital Management Chief Investment Officer says the banking space pecking order has changed from what it was before the coronavirus outbreak ,"Hiren Ved, CEO, Director and CIO, Alchemy Capital Management, thinks the correction seen in the May-June period is over and Indian companies seem to have done well on the earnings front despite the odds.  “We are constructive about the market. The single reason for that is despite macro headwinds, earnings in India have held up reasonably well. For the next two years, Nifty can still deliver mid-teen earnings growth. That is the reason Indian markets have been fairly resilient,” he told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.  The biggest driver of the market over the last month has been a rally in banking and financial services stocks. They have a large weight—40 percent—in the Nifty as well as the Sensex. After months of sluggishness, these stocks have finally seen some buying, pushing up the indices.  The Nifty has rallied nearly 9 percent since hitting lows in June. The Nifty Bank index is up 14 percent from its 52-week low hit in June 2022.  “Financials should lead the market hereon. Credit growth has moved up sharply. Net interest margins are expanding for most of the banks,” said Ved, adding the largest delta of earnings within Nifty would be in that space.  He said that going deeper into the banking space, the pecking order was changing from what it was before the coronavirus pandemic.  “Even within the banking space, leadership is clearly changing. ICICI Bank clearly leads both HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank–both in terms of consistency of performance across parameters and growth,” Ved said.  His thoughts echo those of several analysts who believe ICICI Bank is the best investment in the banking space. The stock is one of the few stocks on which every analyst has a “buy” rating, as per Bloomberg data.  Says no to Tata Steel  Tata Steel beat analyst expectations in its earnings announcement on July 25 but Ved is not a fan of such stocks. It is difficult to make money from cyclical names in the long term, he said.  “There are better structural plays at this time where there is clear visibility in growth and not that kind of volatility,” he said.  Tata Steel was one of the best-performing stocks in the calendar year 2021, riding on huge demand and rising international prices. However, this year, it is among the biggest losers in the Nifty pack, down about 40 percent.  Also Read: Can the recession in the US, Europe catalyse adverse ‘chemical’ reactions on D-St?  Ved identified four structural growth areas—engineering, research &amp;amp; development (ER&amp;amp;D) software companies, speciality chemicals both across pharma and agro chemicals, consumer discretionary– liquor, QSR and retails, and financials.

Asset quality continued to improve, with the GNPA ratio down 19bps qoq to 3.4%, while the bank carries an industry-best PCR of 80% and contingent buffer of 0.9% of loans. The bank continued to clock strong credit growth at 21% yoy/4% qoq, led by retail growth of 24% yoy and BB/SME, supporting high loan yields, and thus leading to high margins of 4%. We believe that margins may further improve given the bank’s strong growth, increasing share of retail portfolio, including unsecured loans, and higher floating rate book, which all could support core-operating profitability (20% CAGR over FY22-25E). As per management, higher slippages in Q1 at Rs58bn/3.2% were mainly due to the seasonal stress in the KCC portfolio, and should reverse, while recovery trends are improving. That said, the bank has made additional prudent contingent provisions of Rs10.5bn, given rising systemic disruption, and it should help keep incremental LLP under check. We are raising our FY23-25 earnings estimates by 1-3%. Outlook ICICI continues to outperform its large peers on core-profitability, led by better margins/fees and cost management, while lower LLP should lift RoEs to a historical high of 17%.

icici,2022-07-25T11:32:55+05:30,Aparna Iyer,ICICI Bank vs HDFC Bank: A tale of outperformance,ICICI Bank’s valuation boost began more from HDFC Bank’s troubles than its own outperformance. But the first-quarter performance of both lenders shows that ICICI Bank’s outperformance is the main driver of valuations. ,"  What began as a series of unfortunate events at a rival bank has now turned into a story of personal outperformance.    India’s top two private sector lenders, ICICI Bank Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd, were born together in 1994 but diverged in their performance and path many times.   When it comes to investors, ICICI Bank has reclaimed its position as the most favoured company in the banking space after a gap of many years. Indeed, most analysts now tag ICICI Bank’s stock a buy even though this seems to be the most crowded trade.  For perspective, ICICI Bank’s shares have risen by 18 percent over the past one year. The broad Nifty has gained about 5 percent. HDFC Bank has disappointed investors with a 3 percent fall. If we take their share price journey from pre-pandemic highs, the story doesn’t change much.   Last month, Jefferies India Pvt Ltd highlighted the fact that ICICI Bank offers the best risk-reward mix among all global banks. It said the lender would report superior returns on assets on a consistent basis and has enough firepower to participate in India’s credit recovery without accidents of bad loans.   “Our target multiple for ICICI is now on a par with HDFC Bank,” wrote analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a July 24 note.   As said earlier, ICICI Bank’s valuation boost began more from HDFC Bank’s troubles than its own outperformance. But the first-quarter performance of both lenders shows that ICICI Bank’s outperformance is the main driver of valuations. The private sector lender has trumped its rival on almost all profitability metrics for the quarter.   Bank in shining armour   ICICI Bank’s strongest performance point has been its operating profit growth. The bank reported 19 percent year-on-year increase in core operating profit for Q1FY23, higher than HDFC Bank’s 15 percent.   True, the bank’s operating profit growth has been volatile even as HDFC Bank’s has been more consistent. But operating profit growth has been consistent over the past four quarters.    While operating expenses continue to remain relatively elevated, the bank’s core interest income leaves the rest of the private sector lenders ny the wayside. For Q1FY23, net interest income growth was a smart 21 percent versus HDFC Bank’s 15 percent and other banks’ single-digit or low double- digit growth.    In a troubled quarter for treasury operations, ICICI Bank reported a small trading income unlike a trading loss by several lenders. That said, the bank too suffered a hit on its bond portfolio just like the others.   The bank’s loan book has shown interesting changes. Post-pandemic, ICICI Bank’s book has turned retail heavy while HDFC Bank has ventured big into wholesale lending. The share of retail loans now stands at 53 percent in ICICI Bank’s book, mostly driven by secured lending.    HDFC Bank’s loan portfolio is now corporate loan-heavy with a growing share of small business loans. With this divergence, the largest private sector lender’s margins are expected to remain superior to others. That said, low-cost deposits will help ICICI Bank too.   Return on assets    A key swing factor in investor sentiment towards ICICI Bank has been the sharp drop in dud loans. As the lender shed loans that were not generating income, the drag on core operating profit has stopped.    Further, the lender’s need to set aside a large part of its profits as provisions has also come down. This double benefit has meant that the bank’s return on assets has expanded quickly. No wonder analysts have increased their expectations here.    Those at Jefferies see an RoA increase of 2 percent for FY23. Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd expects 2.1 percent growth. Unlike a year ago, when 5.2 percent of loans were non-performing, only 3.4 percent of loans do not generate any income for ICICI Bank. The improvement has been because of the bank’s renewed focus on retail and a conscious effort to be cautious on wholesale lending.    The management has indicated, though, that it would seek out opportunities in corporate lending during the current economic recovery. HDFC Bank continues to retain its premium as far as asset quality goes. The bank has been consistent in keeping its bad loan ratios low even during times of crisis.   Verdict of the markets   If one goes by the valuations, the markets favour ICICI Bank compared with HDFC Bank now. The rally in the former’s share price still has some steam left, according to analysts. At current price, ICICI Bank’s shares traded at roughly twice the estimated book value for FY24, similar to HDFC Bank’s multiple.    The gap has been bridged largely because of HDFC Bank’s valuation erosion over the past two years owing to concerns over technology, uncertainty surrounding the merger with Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd and a management change.    However, from here on analysts believe that ICICI Bank’s performance, if sustained, could continue to keep it in favourable books of investors.   “The stock return will be a function of earnings growth and re-rating over the coming years and ICICI Bank has all the ingredients in place to take over the pole position in the Indian banking space,” wrote Motilal Oswal analysts.   ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/icici-bank-vs-hdfc-bank-a-tale-of-outperformance-8881781.html

Sharp fall in provisions:  ICICI Bank’s provisions, excluding provision for tax, declined by 60 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,144 crore in the April-June quarter, down from from Rs 2,852 crore last year. The provisions for the first quarter include contingency provision of Rs 1,050 crore made on “a prudent basis,” the bank said. The provision coverage ratio on non-performing assets was 79.6 percent at June 30.

The rural portfolio grew by 8 percent year-on-year and was flat sequentially at the end of the first quarter.  Further, domestic advances grew by 22 percent year-on-year and 4 percent sequentially in the fiscal first quarter. Total advances increased by 21 percent year-on-year and 4 percent sequentially to Rs 895,625 crore in June.

Profit for the June 2021 quarter stood at Rs 4,616 crore.

The bank further said the net interest margin at 4.01 percent for the June quarter improved from 3.89 percent in year-ago quarter, and 4 percent in March 2022 quarter.  The loan book increased by 21 percent year-on-year to Rs 8.95 lakh crore for the June quarter, with domestic book growing 22 percent and retail loan portfolio, comprised 53 percent of total loan book, rising by 24 percent during the quarter.  Corporate loan growth was a modest 14.4 percent. The management sounded optimistic on loan demand but refrained from giving a target for the financial year. The bank said total period-end deposits increased by 13 percent year-on-year to Rs 10.5 lakh crore in Q1FY23.  A strong traction in core interest income and resilience in other income resulted in the double digit growth in operating profit.  The bank registered a 15.9 percent year-on-year growth in pre-provision operating profit at Rs 10,309 crore, with operating expenses rising 25.3 percent YoY to Rs 7,566 crore for the quarter.  Non-interest income (other income) for the quarter increased by 16.75 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,665.2 crore, with fee income growth of 32 percent YoY. &quot;There was a treasury gain of Rs 36 crore in Q1FY23 compared to a gain of Rs 290 crore in Q1FY22,&quot; the bank said. The bank took a mark-to-market hit of Rs 400 crore on its investment which dented treasury income.  Also read - Kotak Mahindra Bank reports 26% growth in Q1 profit at Rs 2,071 crore on lower provisions  Another factor contributing to net profit rise was decrease in provisions. Provisions and contingencies fell sharply by 60 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,143.82 crore for the quarter, but there was 7 percent increase on sequential basis.  Asset quality improved further with gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances falling 19 bps sequentially to 3.41 percent in the quarter ended June 2022. Net NPA in the same period fell by 6 bps to 0.7 percent.  However, ICICI bank’s fresh slippages more than doubled sequentially, a sign that incremental stress has risen. Slippages during the quarter were Rs 5,285 crore, up from Rs 4,204 crore in the previous quarter. The bank’s management said that the increase is not worrisome as slippages may be upgraded in the next quarter. “It is more technical slippages. These tend to get upgraded in the coming quarters,” said Executive Director Sandeep Batra in a media call.  Batra added that the spike in slippages is also due to those coming from Kisan credit cards, which tend to bunch up during the first quarter.  To be sure, the bank’s recoveries and upgrades during the quarter have risen by 16 percent sequentially. The bank’s provision coverage ratio remains high around 80 percent.

It trades at 1.1x on PB/RoA, as its one-year forward core banking PB of 2x is well justified by its RoA of 1.8-1.9 percent, which also has a potential upside risk,” the brokerage said.  “In fact, among global banks that are near 1x on PB/RoA, ICICI Bank offers among the highest RoA,” it said in a report.  Jefferies has set a 12-month target of Rs 1,070 on the stock in the base case, and said it can even touch Rs 1,170 if a few things work in ICICI Bank’s favour. A potential upside of 64 percent from the current levels will be a big push for the stock. In a bear market scenario, it has set the target at Rs 660.  The lender is better placed given lower exposure to riskier sectors and manageable share of SME or unsecured retail loans. It also has among the strongest deposit franchises and, thus, should benefit from deposit polarisation, the report said.  ICICI Bank currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 21 times and price-to-book ratio of about three times. In 2022, the stock was down nearly 7 percent but in the last five years it has jumped 2.5 times.  It has outperformed many of its peers, both in terms of stock performance and financial performance, in the recent years and also edged past its biggest competitor HDFC Bank, turning street opinion in its favour.  Analysts believe that there are multiple catalysts present for the bank such as easing of Covid restrictions and normalisation of lending activity, unsecured retail portfolio asset quality holding up better than expected, deposit rate cuts and higher CASA as benefits of deposit polarisation and early resolution of stressed assets.  Jefferies sees ICICI Bank averaging a 17 percent annual growth rate in profit over FY22-24 and a 16 percent return on equity (RoE). “An area of potential positive surprise is its overseas NIMs, which could expand, as the global liquidity market in tightening, which could lead to higher margins in the medium term for lenders,” it said.  ICICI Bank is placed suitably to leverage on the uptick in bank credit growth that has improved from 8-9 percent to 12 percent on-year. It could also leverage an uptick in capex cycle given its domain expertise in project financing.  Domestic analysts have similar views. They see the stock rising in the range of 20-50 percent in the next 12 months.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jefferies-rates-icici-bank-as-best-banking-investment-sees-50-upside-for-stock-8742161.html

icici,2022-06-21T19:59:32+05:30,Priyanka Iyer,RBI nukes multiple Indian fintechs through guidelines on prepaid instruments,RBI’s notice to many fintechs on June 20 is pushing fast-growing fintechs to pull breaks and reconsider their core business offerings.,"&quot;I think the RBI is in a civil war. One faction talks about innovation and inclusion. Another faction works hard to undermine this. This circular makes no sense to me at all.&quot;  &quot;They seem to have decided to close fintech companies in India. One blow coming after the other.&quot;  These were just some of the messages being exchanged between founders of fintechs in India on WhatsApp groups on the evening of June 20th, minutes after a letter by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) threatened to endanger their very existence. In a missive that went out to many startups in the evening, the RBI said that loading credit lines into prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) such as wallets and prepaid cards is not permitted.  What seemed like a routine Monday swiftly turned into an existential crisis for many Indian fintechs. RBI reminded these entities that a prepaid instrument can only be loaded using cash, a bank account debit, or a proper debit or credit card, and other PPIs and ‘other payment instruments issued by regulated entities’.  It was just a two-paragraph-long clarification, but words so potent that it threatened to junk the business model of a number of fintechs that have seen tremendous growth over the past year. Apart from unicorns like Slice, others like Uni, PayU owned LazyPay, KreditBee, extend loans through prepaid cards which are issued by their partner banks including SBM Bank India, RBL Bank, among others.  Many of these fintechs have grown in size and visibility and have managed to become well-known brands in the past year. They have actors as brand ambassadors, are even IPL sponsors and have raised millions in funding. This clarification potentially puts a question mark on all of this, some industry insiders say.  RBI continues to play Cupid to ensure Fintechs Banks — Amrish Rau (@amrishrau) June 21, 2022   What is the confusion?  The clarification, viewed by Moneycontrol, was addressed to &quot;All Authorised Non-bank Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) Issuers.&quot;  At first glance, it looks like these players are safe because prepaid cards under their branding are issued by their partner banks. However, the loan itself comes from non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in most instances, and the customer can avail of it through a bank-issued prepaid card. That is what the RBI may be against.  Secondly, as the communication said that norms don’t allow for credit lines to be loaded in PPIs at all, it puts a question on the overall model, even if the prepaid instrument is issued by a bank.  What’s worrying is none of this has been explicitly stated. So, what are the fintechs supposed to do? A few have already stopped issuing cards or will soon pull the plug.  A senior executive of one of the impacted fintechs said, “My sense is all PPI regardless of who issues it will get affected now or very soon. This is a concern. We will have to stop issuing cards very soon until there is more clarity.”  The move may also impact players like OlaMoney Postpaid Plus and Paytm Payments Bank. While OlaMoney Postpaid Plus uses a wallet to load credit from its NBFC partner Aditya Birla Finance, Paytm has been loading customers’ wallets with Paytm Postpaid credit lines. According to Macquarie, more clarity is needed on the impact on Paytm.    RBI’s mixed signals  Over the past few months, multiple instructions have come from the RBI. On the one hand, RBI aims to be a friend of the fintechs, working hand in hand and consulting with them to release a set of guidelines on digital lending. These guidelines are being worked on by the newly formed fintech department within the RBI.  On the other hand, clarifications or changes in guidelines like these are aimed at one set of players – those facilitating loans to be used through a card form factor.  On April 21, RBI released new norms for co-branded cards as part of the Master Direction on debit and credit cards, a document that consolidates instructions on rules and regulations.  The Master Direction limited the role of co-branding entities to marketing and distribution of credit or pre-paid cards, casting a shadow on the viability of the business models of these fintechs. The changes which are set to come into effect on July 1 also said that the co-branding partner shall not have access to information relating to transactions undertaken through the card.  “The signals from RBI have to be looked at in totality, despite separate communications. What is unclear is that there no reasons assigned. If you say this is wrong and hence we are stopping it, it makes it clear,” said the founder mentioned above.  How the industry reacted  The central bank has left all fintechs confused with its cryptic wording. These budding startups are now looking for answers (and some even a workaround) on whether this means that they need to stop their core offering altogether and go back to the drawing board.  While founders wondered why the RBI was dealing a deathly blow,  Amrish Rau, the CEO of Pine Labs, tweeted suggesting that this was another move to ensure that fintechs remain dependent on banks.  Already reeling from a slowdown in funding, upending the key product offering, marketing and branding is going to be a question of survival with many risking losing customers in the process.  A fintech founder remarked, “If it actually means what we fear, the move will impact 10-15 million customers who currently use these products.”  Advantage banks  But banks have been long concerned about the spurt in the growth of these companies, especially that of Slice which had been adding 200,000 to 300,000 per month, at par with leading credit card issuers like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.  “These banks have been wanting to know what Slice is doing to achieve such numbers. They have been a worried month after month with their disbursal numbers,” said a source on the condition of anonymity.  A day after this clarification by the RBI, Macquarie said in a note, “We believe this regulation could significantly impact the fintechs involved in this business and would be advantageous to banks, as they can further accelerate card acquisition with less competition.”  In a direct impact, the stock of SBI cards closed higher by 6.78 percent in trade on June 21.  Was this expected?  The move by some is also being seen as expected. Over the past few months, RBI has been more cautious of card issuing fintechs as compared to other lending or Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) players who extend credit independent of any prepaid instruments.  Customers too had been misunderstanding these products, taking them to be a credit card. In fact, this is a personal loan being linked to a card, a fact that came as a shock to many customers leading to many complaints on social media against these fintechs. Fintechs on the other hand claim to be transparent about the product.  On this, the note by Macquarie said, “The main purpose of a PPI license is to act as a payment instrument and not as a credit instrument, and we believe many fintechs were using this as a channel to load credit.”  “We also believe many customers were unknowingly taking a line of credit through their wallets at the point of check-out. Some of these practices have not gone down well with the regulator, in our view.”  While many of these players grew aggressively in a high liquidity-low interest rate scenario, many believe RBI sees these models as a systemic risk with agreements such as First Loan Default Guarantee (FLDG) in the picture under which fintechs agree to compensate lending partners to a certain extent in case of a default.  That said, fintechs too seem to have done their due diligence before launching these products.  “It's not like these entities have just gone ahead and done what they want. They've had someone advising them. This is the destruction of value and trust, how will customers trust these brands now,” said a founder quoted above.  In a legal opinion dated February 11, 2022, former Chief Justice of India VN Khare concluded that lending through PPIs can be allowed, and many players have banked on this. The opinion was sought by one of the card players, according to sources.  The legal opinion document as seen by Moneycontrol mentions players including OlaMoney Postpaid Plus, Dhani Loans, and Services, TVS Credit Services, a joint offering by Bajaj Finserv and Mobikwik, and LazyPay.  “It is opined that it shall be permissible under the payment and settlement systems laws as well as RBI regulations and directions (including PSS Act and PPI Directions) to undertake loading of funds into PPI Card of the Customer by the Financing Partner through the credit line/facility in an aforesaid manner,” the opinion by the former Chief Justice read.  While fintechs can use this in their favour, RBI’s word shall prevail on these matters.  For now, there are many interpretations, disappointments, and reactions after the two paragraphs issued by RBI on June 21. Fintechs meanwhile are scrambling for clear answers, or by some miracle a change of heart by the RBI.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/rbi-just-nuked-multiple-indian-fintechs-with-its-circular-on-prepaid-instruments-8719211.html

The global rating agency has upgraded the baseline credit assessments (BCAs) to baa3 from ba1. The upgrade of the BCAs does not result in any change in the deposit ratings because these are already at the same level as the India sovereign rating (Baa3 stable), Moody’s said in a statement on Friday. The upgrade of the two banks’ BCAs is driven by improvements in asset quality, capital, and profitability. Their asset quality has seen a significant improvement, with both the gross and net non-performing loans (NPL) ratios declining. ”Credit costs have also reduced at the same time as provision coverage has increased. Lower credit costs have resulted in higher profitability,” it said. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank’s return on assets for the year ending March 2022 was 1.8 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively, compared to an average of 0.8 per cent and 0.4 per cent over the four years ending March 2020, it said. ICICI Bank’s profitability has also benefited from rising net interest margins as the share of the low margin international business has come down in the last four years, it added. Both lenders have raised equity capital, resulting in significantly higher capital ratios, it said, adding the core equity tier 1 ratios of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank at end March 2022 were 17.6 per cent and 15.2 per cent respectively, compared to 13.6 per cent and 11.3 per cent at end March 2019. However, it said, Axis Bank’s proposed acquisition of Citigroup Inc’s India consumer assets will result in an approximately 230 bps decline in capital at the bank. As Axis Bank has good access to capital markets, the ratings agency expects the bank to raise capital to maintain its current capital ratios. Axis Bank is targeting to close the acquisition by March 2023.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moodys-upgrades-baseline-credit-assessments-of-icici-bank-axis-bank-8703981.html

icici,2022-06-08T13:55:53+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"RBI monetary policy: Repo rate hiked by 50 bps, 9 rate-sensitive stocks can give 6-20% return",We have collated a list of rate-sensitive stocks that experts say can give 6-20 percent return over the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are calculated based on the closing price of June 7:,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has unanimously decided to hike the repo rate by 50 basis points (bps) to 4.9 percent as inflation is likely to be above 6 percent till December 2022 given global growth risks and geopolitical tensions. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target range, while supporting growth.  After the repo rate hike, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 4.65 percent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the bank rate to 5.15 percent, but the MPC has decided to keep cash reserve ratio (CRR) unchanged at 4.5 percent.  “The supply-side measures taken by the government would help to alleviate some cost-push pressures. At the same time, however, the MPC notes that continuing shocks to food inflation could sustain pressures on headline inflation. Persisting inflationary pressures could set in motion second-round effects on headline CPI (Consumer Price Index). Hence, there is a need for calibrated monetary policy action to keep inflation expectations anchored and restrain the broadening of price pressures,” the RBI said in its note.  The central bank raised its full year FY23 inflation forecast to 6.7 percent, from 5.7 percent earlier, as the tense global geopolitical situation and the consequent elevated commodity prices impart considerable uncertainty to the domestic inflation outlook. While considering the inflation forecast, the RBI hopes for a normal monsoon in 2022 and an average crude oil price (Indian basket) of $105 per barrel.  “The MPC increased its CPI estimates to 6.7 percent from 5.7 percent for FY23, which now appears to be a more realistic level. This contributes to enhanced credibility and confidence in the RBI’s policy decisions. The status quo on CRR certainly comes as a positive surprise for the banking sector and augurs well to nurture credit growth revival,” said Yesha Shah, head of equity research at Samco Securities.  Overall, as the repo rate still has some catching up to do compared to global peers, this policy seems to be in the right direction to achieve governor Shaktikanta Das’ aim to bring back the policy rates to at-least pre-Covid levels, she believes.  The RBI expects further input and output price pressures considering early results from manufacturing, services and infrastructure sector firms polled in the its surveys, but it has retained real GDP growth projection for FY23 at 7.2 percent, though spillovers from prolonged geopolitical tensions, elevated commodity prices, continued supply bottlenecks and tightening global financial conditions weighed on the outlook.  “The recovery in domestic economic activity is gathering strength. Rural consumption should benefit from the likely normal southwest monsoon and the expected improvement in agricultural prospects. A rebound in contact-intensive services is likely to bolster urban consumption, going forward,” the central bank reasoned.  Investment activity is expected to be supported by improving capacity utilisation, the government’s capex push, and strengthening bank credit, the RBI said.

The stock has now approached a significant support at Rs 1,300 levels (61.8 percent Fibonacci levels from the March 2020 low of Rs 560 to October 2021 high of Rs 2,598). The interweek/intermonth technical outlook will shift to buy mode only if the stock stays firm above Rs 1,300 levels. Confirmation of strength only above Rs 1,421 mark.

The memorandum of understanding (MoU) between ICICI and Santander UK Plc, signed in Mumbai, is designed to establish a framework of partnership between the banks to meet the financial service requirements of corporate customers operating within the India-UK corridor.  ICICI Bank said it will provide banking solutions across trade, cross-border payments, supply chain, treasury solutions and retail banking to the UK corporates operating in India and Santander UK will support Indian corporates and new age businesses for their banking requirements in the UK.  Historically, India and UK have strong bilateral relations and India has been a preferred foreign investment destination for UK businesses. UK ranks amongst the top 10 countries investing in India, said Sriram H Iyer, Head of the International Banking Group who signed the MoU on behalf of ICICI Bank.  This MoU helps to provide seamless banking services for corporates in the UK-India corridor.  With our wide network, industry-first digital offerings, and comprehensive suite of corporate ecosystem banking, we are confident that ICICI Bank will support Santander UK and help its customers grow their business in India, and make India one of their key markets, he said.  The partnership is aimed at serving the banking needs of the corporate ecosystem in the growing UK-India corridor, the banking executive noted.  According to official government statistics, the UK is the sixth-largest investor in India’s economy, with cumulative foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows of USD 31.7 billion and contributing 6 per cent to India’s total FDI inflows.  John Carroll, Head of International and Transactional Banking at Santander UK, said its pact with ICICI will help the bank support even more UK companies to realise their international ambitions in India.  ICICI Bank stands out as a pioneer in the Indian banking industry, bringing industry-first digital solutions as well as local expertise, client focused solutions and a tailored sectoral approach, said Carroll.  This is twinned with a shared belief in the power of our international ecosystems, which will support ambitious UK SMEs looking to succeed in India.  Next month, we’ll be launching our digital platform to help UK companies navigate their way through the unknown and sometimes daunting path to international expansion, he said.  We have already established a significant number of agreements with banks and other key trade facilitation experts worldwide but with India increasing in importance as a destination for UK businesses to explore, adding ICICI Bank and India to our ecosystem means we’re now able to support even more UK companies to realise their international ambitions, he added.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/icici-bank-ties-up-with-santander-for-india-uk-business-ease-8482821.html

These lenders include Bandhan Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Jana Small Finance Bank, Bank of Baroda, and ICICI Bank. These lenders have announced deposit rate hikes across multiple tenor baskets for retail customers.  Kotak Mahindra Bank, in a statement, said it has increased fixed deposit interest rates by 30 basis points and 35 basis points for the tenure of 390 days and 23 months, respectively. Similarly, Bandhan Bank, too, raised the interest rate on deposits by 50 basis points for one year to 18 months and above 18 months to less than two years tenure deposits.  This follows banks hiking lending rates. A host of banks have increased their lending rates already. These include Bank of Baroda and ICICI Bank. ICICI Bank has raised the external benchmark lending rate by 40 basis points to 8.10 percent.  Analysts predict more banks may soon announce increases in lending and deposit rates.  On May 4, the central bank increased the repo rate by 40 basis points to 4.4 percent for the first time in almost two years since the start of the pandemic in 2020. While this move by the RBI is bound to affect the individuals with loans, it came as good news for those investing in fixed deposits, according to analysts.  &quot;Since around 40 percent of banking system's loan is linked to REPO, all of those will automatically become costlier with the increase in REPO by the same amount,&quot; added Prakash Agarwal, a banking analyst and president of financial services at India Ratings and Research.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/at-least-five-banks-raise-fd-rates-a-day-after-surprise-rbi-rate-hike-8460101.html

ICICI Bank raised its external benchmark lending rate by 40 bps to 8.10 percent. Bank of Baroda also hikes the repo-linked lending rate by 40 bps to 6.90 percent.  The monetary policy committee (MPC) on May 4 raised lending rates by 40 basis points to 4.40 percent and also hiked the cash reserve ratio by 50 basis points. The decision was taken by the MPC during an off-cycle meeting with the central board held May 2-4.  “The decision to raise repo rate may be seen as a reversal of rate action of May 2020. Last month, we set out a stance of withdrawal of accommodation. Today's action needs to be seen in line with that action,” RBI governor, Shaktikanta Das said in his statement.

Touted as the UPI moment for lending, the AA framework ensures swift data sharing with the consent of the user and eliminates the need for physical documents.  Since it went live in September 2021, 332,000 customer accounts have been linked and over 310,000 consent requests have been fulfilled.  The framework facilitates sharing of financial information on a real-time basis between regulated entities. AAs are licensed by the Reserve Bank of India to enable the flow of data between Financial Information Providers (FIPs) and Financial Information Users (FIUs).  FIPs are institutions that hold customer data and FIUs are entities that consume data to offer better service, underwrite loans, and so on. Banks and other financial institutions must become FIPs to be able to also become users of data from other financial institutions.  An AA is data blind and only receives encrypted data which is decrypted only by the FIU.  Union Bank of India has said that it will work both as an FIU and FIP to allow its customers to share data digitally on a real-time basis.  Major private sector banks like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are already live as FIPs and FIUs. There are 34 banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and other institutions so far live on AA, including Federal Bank, IDFC First Bank and IndusInd Bank.  Moneycontrol had reported on January 17 that the next step for the ecosystem is to grow the number of FIPs and get more banks to go live, mainly the State Bank of India (SBI) which has the largest share of accounts in India.  As per information on the website of Sahamati, a not-for-profit self-organised collective for the AA ecosystem, SBI is in the testing mode.  The ecosystem is also working on linking accounts of Small and Medium Enterprises as only individual current and savings accounts are linked currently. Insurers are working on integrating too and the next step will be to get mutual funds on board.  CAMS, FinVu, NADL and OneMoney have launched AA app and website interfaces for customers to use.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/announcements/union-bank-becomes-first-public-sector-bank-to-go-live-on-account-aggregator-framework-8434251.html

Small businesses from other banks can log in as guests to get instant and paperless overdraft facility of up to Rs 25 lakh and open current accounts digitally. Users should download the new version of the InstaBIZ app, the lender said.  “Named ‘InstaOD Plus,’ the industry-first proposition enables customers of any bank to avail of an overdraft instantly through a few clicks either on the new version of InstaBIZ or on the corporate internet banking platform,” the lender said on April 28. “Customers of ICICI Bank can activate the OD in their current accounts instantly while customers of other banks can do so after opening a current account with the bank digitally through video KYC.”  MSMEs buoyant ICICI Bank executive director Anup Bagchi told reporters that while some micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), especially those operating in contact-intensive sectors, had been impacted during Covid-19, the overall health of ICICI Bank’s MSME customers remains buoyant.  “Our portfolio is looking very good. Yes, there are certain parts of MSMEs which got deeply impacted… But that is opening up quite nicely,” Bagchi said.  Most companies in the bank’s MSME portfolio are now at pre-Covid levels, he added.  ICICI Bank’s loans to small and medium enterprises (SME) rose 34 percent to Rs 40,450 crore at the end of March. SME loans accounted for 4.7 percent of the bank’s overall advances, which climbed 17 percent to Rs 8.59 lakh crore.  Asked whether the bank’s risk appetite in the MSME sector was increasing, Bagchi said though risk appetite is high, the objective is to achieve risk-calibrated growth.  He said during Covid-19, MSMEs became more efficient in terms of resilience and cashflows and the good ones became better. The businesses that suffered were large MSMEs that were overleveraged, although some of them have started performing well after restructuring their loans.  Bagchi said another key difference that is visible and should become a trend is lending to MSMEs based on their cashflows and not on their solvency. He said solvency-based MSME lending created many issues but with the rapid adoption of digital services, there are many high-frequency data points that a bank can use to lend on the basis of cashflows.  Asked about the growing competition from fintechs, Bagchi said: “That is a question that they have to answer more than we have to. They have to figure it out. Let them make a comprehensive app like this because they can’t lend, they can’t do instant, they can’t do many things.”  He said it was for fintech companies to demonstrate how they will be relevant.  “We are already relevant. We will become more relevant and we will learn from them because they are also doing some fantastic stuff,” he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/icici-bank-upgrades-digital-services-for-msmes-to-maintain-risk-calibrated-growth-approach-in-lending-8425421.html

The bank reported a RoA/RoE of 2.1%/17% in 4QFY22. Business growth continues to gain traction, with a jump of 17% YoY and 6% QoQ, led by Retail, SME, and Business Banking. RoE crossed the 15% mark in 3Q and 4QFY22 saw a further rise (~170bp). While the stock has done well on a relative basis, current valuations leave ample scope for a re-rating. The stock is well-positioned to undergo a swift re-rating over FY23, generating strong returns for the investors, as ICICIBC continues with its journey to deliver solid return ratios and growth.

Asset quality continues to trend well, with the GNPA ratio down to 3.6%, while the bank carries a strong specific PCR of 79.5% and a contingent buffer of 0.8% of loans, which should support profitability, going forward. Overall credit growth remained healthy at 17% yoy/6% qoq, mainly driven by retail, SME and business banking, which is reflected in the bank’s healthy margin performance (domestic @ ~4.1% vs. HDFCB @ 4.2%). There is a change in KMP with the resignation of corporate head Mrs. Vishakha Mulye who is being replaced by Mr. Anup Bagchi (retail head) and the elevation of CFO Mr. Rakesh Jha as ED-Retail Banking. Given top management’s approach to provide all-around exposure to managers, which we believe is long-term positive, we hope for minimal near-term disruption with retail growth largely being self-sustaining now. Factoring in healthy credit growth (19-21%), better margins (nearly 70% of asset portfolio on floating rate) and lower LLP (better asset quality + part usage of contingent buffer), we upgrade FY22-24E EPS by ~3% and RoE to ~16-17%. We trim our standalone bank target multiple to 2.7x from 2.9x, taking into account higher CoE across banks. However, adjusted for better earnings and rolling fwd target multiple to FY24E ABV from Dec’23, we retain Buy with TP of Rs1,025.  Outlook ICICI, trading at 1.8x FY24E ABV, has narrowed the valuation gap with close peer HDFCB (standalone: 2.2x/merged: 2x) at a faster-than-expected pace due to the former’s strong core performance, with the latter struggling with management changes, tech issues and now the merger overhang. The valuation gap has further room for reduction, as ICICI sustains its core performance and HDFCB faces merger drag. ICICI's top management premium has yet to be realized, and HDFCB may struggle to reclaim the management premium it had in the past.

According to analysts, a fall in non-performing assets and a better digital presence were among the factors that helped the bank overcome pandemic problems in the last quarter of FY22.  Like other banks, ICICI too was hit by the COVID-19 waves but the economic momentum recovered in February and March.  Digital initiatives, technology  Analysts said ICICI Bank’s growth was driven by its corporate customers, of which small and medium enterprises (SME) constituted a major part.  “The corporate book was led by well-rated entities as per its stated strategy,” analysts at Motilal Oswal said.  They said the considerable growth in small business banking credit was driven by digital initiatives. The bank said growth in the SME and business banking portfolios was driven by its digital offerings and platforms such as InstaBIZ and Merchant Stack.  “The bank has higher exposure towards working capital loans compared to term lending,” said analysts of Systematix Group.  Credit growth  The bank’s retail loan portfolio, excluding rural loans, grew by 19.7 percent year-on-year and 6 percent sequentially. Growth in personal loans and the credit card portfolio was 31.9 percent year-on-year.  The value of credit card spending grew by 77 percent year-on-year in Q4, driven by a higher activation rate. According to analysts, the factors that contributed to this growth included tie-ups in credit cards.  “The bank has recently tied up with Emirates, while its Amazon co-branded card is performing well. RBI master guidelines on credit and debit cards should not have any impact,” Motilal Oswal analysts said.  The SME loan portfolio grew by 33.6 percent y-o-y and 11.3 percent q-o-q. Overseas loans also contributed significantly, growing 9.8 percent y-o-y.  “Overseas loan book growth was primarily driven by India-linked trade finance book,” stated a report by Systematix Group.  Fall in NPAs  With the recovery in the economy, the financial position of customers, including individuals, improved gradually, leading to a reduction in non-performing assets or bad loans.  “The last two years were very bad in terms of growth and repayment,” said Vinod Nair, a banking analyst. Now, new business growth is happening, he added.  ICICI Bank’s net NPA ratio declined to 0.76 percent on March 31 from 0.85 percent on December 31, 2021. Net deletions from gross NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale, were Rs 489 crore in the quarter.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/icici-banks-q4-results-three-key-takeaways-8408781.html

NII for the quarter grew by 21% YoY/3% QoQ to INR 12,605 cr, led by strong advances growth of 17% YoY.

Asset quality of the bank improved with GNPA at 3.6% vs. 4.1% QoQ led by strong recoveries &amp;amp; upgrades and negative net slippages. Restructuring pool of the bank declined from 120 bps to 100 bps QoQ at INR 8,267 cr. The sequential decline in outstanding balance was mainly due to prepayment by a borrower in the construction sector. Bank has made additional contingent provision of INR 1,025 cr during the quarter and holds provision buffer of INR 7,450 cr (0.9% of advances) which provides comfort over balance sheet position.

Provision for the reported quarter slumped 63 percent on-year to Rs 1,069 crore. Provisions for Q4 included contingency provision of Rs 1,025 crore made on a prudent basis, ICICI Bank said.  The strong growth in net interest income of the lender was led by a 17 percent year-on-year growth in loan portfolio. Analysts had expected the private sector bank to report 15-18 percent growth in loans in the reported quarter.  The non-interest segment of the lender also showed firm growth as sales grew by 11 percent on-year to Rs 4,608 crore.

Rupee revenue grew by 7.3% QoQ to INR 6,817Mn (with a CC revenue growth of 7.4% in Q4FY22), powered by Embedded Product Design (EPD) growing at 7.5% QoQ, while Industrial Design and Visualization (IDV) grew smartly at 8.0% QoQ. Operating margin for the quarter stood at 32.1%. The overall growth was fueled by digital and platform-led deals. Significant growth in the automotive market helped TELX to win large and strategic deals with both OEM and suppliers in EV and autonomous technologies. Reported Net profit grew by 6% QoQ to INR 1,600Mn with margin of 23.5%. In-spite of the ongoing talent crunch, margins to remain stable in the near term, led by higher offshoring/utilization, deeper customer mining, large sustainable deals, rebalancing vertical/geographical mix and operating leverage.

Our target price of INR 8,884 is based on 64x Mar-24E EPS with EPS CAGR of 25.4% over FY22-24E.  Outlook TELX is currently trading at a valuation with a P/E multiple of 70.2x/56.9x on FY23E/FY24E earnings. We expect strong deal momentum across verticals, addition of new clients from newer geographies, higher focus on IDV especially in design-led digital projects, and multi-year tailwind in EPD and hence we are assigning a P/E multiple of 64x to the FY24 estimated EPS of INR 138.8 to arrive at a target price of INR 8,884 per share (Earlier INR 7,504), an upside of 12.4% over the CMP.

icici,2022-04-22T19:06:00+05:30,Pushpita Dey, Account aggregator system in banking ensures enhanced customer experience with better data security:...,The network is a financial data-sharing system regulated by the Reserve Bank of India,"The account aggregator (AA) ecosystem, introduced in September 2021, can ensure better security and stronger protection of banking data while enhancing customers’ experience, say experts. Nine private banks including, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and IndusInd Bank went live on the AA system last year and five public sector banks will join this year.  The AA network is a financial data-sharing system regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). One of its main features is that data cannot be shared without the consent of the individual concerned.  The finance ministry in the first week of September 2021 said eight of India’s largest banks had introduced the system, even though its concept was approved by the RBI in 2016 itself.  Better user experience  The government when introducing it said the AA system was aimed at helping individuals securely and digitally access the information they have with a financial institution as well as share this information with any other regulated financial institution within the AA network. Banks that have implemented the system say the network has been built with the customer at the center. It empowers customers to effectively manage their data.  “They have the power to decide with whom their data can be shared, for what purpose it can be used, and for what duration it can be retained,” said Deepak Sharma, president and chief digital officer, Kotak Mahindra Bank.  At its launch, the government said the AA system replaces the complex ‘terms and conditions’ form of ‘blank cheque’ acceptance with granular, step-by-step permissions and control each time the customer’s data is used.  “In a regular scenario, there is significant effort involved, wherein the customer has to share their banking data with another bank/financial institution using hard copies or PDF documents. However, with the AA framework, it is very easy for customers to share information either one time or on an ongoing basis for a defined period of time,” said Sameer Shetty, president, and head, of digital business and transformation, Axis Bank.  Moreover, as pointed out by various lenders, the system makes things easier for customers, eliminating duplication and paperwork to offer seamless information to banks.  “The ease of on-boarding and managing consent by customers will ensure large-scale adoption in every nook and corner of the country,” said Murali Ramakrishnan, MD and CEO, South Indian Bank.  Enhanced encryption of users’ data  The system aims to create a third-party trusted source of information that allows seamless data flow between all players, say experts. “In various cases, once customers’ data is shared with a bank for one purpose, it gets circulated among other departments too. For example, if a customer shares her/his data for a housing loan, it might happen that the vehicle loan department may get access to it. But the AA system prohibits that,” said Nageen Kommu, founder and CEO, Digitap, a tech company providing AI-driven solutions for the banking industry.  Customers can choose which department their data will be shared with and the system minimises the chance of data sharing even within various departments of the same bank. “The system enables customers to offer authentic information in a controlled and managed environment to all the players in the ecosystem, including banks,” said Kunal Jhunjhunwala, founder and MD, Airpay, a payment gateway for banks.  It helps customers take real-time lending decisions in multi-bank personal finance management (PFM) and maintain a consolidated financial dashboard while also enabling wealth assessment and planning, all the while ensuring encryption.  “AA handles the consent management part on behalf of the customer and the data is exchanged only between financial information users (FIU) and financial information providers ensuring that only the right FIU receives the data,” said Sharma.

icici,2022-04-21T10:23:27+05:30,Aparna Iyer,ICICI Bank tops rival HDFC Bank in valuation multiple for first time,"Strong investor interest has helped the lender topple rival HDFC Bank as an expensive stock in what some analysts would call a “crowded trade,” which means a position or theme embraced by a large number of investors.","ICICI Bank’s share price has been on fire for the past one year, raking in gains of over 30 percent. Strong investor interest has helped the lender topple rival HDFC Bank as an expensive stock in what some analysts would call a “crowded trade,” which means a position or theme embraced by a large number of investors. On a 12-month trailing basis, ICICI Bank shares traded at 3.3 times the book value on April 20 compared with HDFC Bank’s multiple of 3 times. Sure, the gap isn’t much and there is a long way to go in terms of market capitalisation. HDFC Bank’s market cap stands at Rs 7.5 lakh crore while that of ICICI Bank is Rs 5.25 lakh crore. However, it is noteworthy that ICICI Bank’s shares have crossed that of its rival for the first time in terms of a key valuation multiple.  Why do investors love ICICI Bank so much? The private sector lender has cleaned up its balance sheet, increased provisioning cover for stressed loans, and turned its corporate-heavy loan portfolio into a retail-dominated one. Its provision coverage ratio stood at 80 percent as of the December quarter of FY22, the highest in the sector. The ratio was a mere 54 percent five years ago. Notwithstanding the pandemic, the lender reported robust net interest income growth in FY21 and in the first three quarters of FY22. This supported operating profit growth. Its net profit growth has shed the volatility of earlier years, credit costs have dropped and return on equity has improved sharply. Free of its stressed corporate book, ICICI Bank’s loan growth has been robust. Another factor favouring ICICI Bank is the fading away of misgivings over its top management and corporate governance. The bank was mired in controversy when its head Chanda Kochhar was alleged to have circumvented conflict of interest norms. She stepped down in October 2018 and her successor Sandeep Bakhshi has steered the bank out of the trouble. The top management transition pain and misgivings over the bank’s governance are now behind it. Investor confidence in the bank’s earnings trajectory remains high. For FY22, analysts expect return on equity to increase to 15 percent and improve further in the coming financial years. The upshot is that earnings growth is expected to trump that of HDFC Bank and profitability metrics look supportive of premium valuations. “ICICI Bank appears firmly placed to deliver healthy sustainable growth, led by its focus on core operating performance. We estimate an RoA/RoE of 2.0%/16.5% for FY24,” analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services said. Will ICICI Bank continue to outperform the market and HDFC Bank? Given the outsized gains in the share price over the past year, analysts note that the margin of outperformance may narrow now. Even so, the lender’s stock will still find enough support among investors despite premium valuations. “There has been a significant outperformance of Axis Bank/ICICI Bank over HDFC Bank but there still appears to be room for further outperformance,” analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note dated April 16. Another factor in support of ICICI Bank shares is that rivals HDFC Bank and Axis Bank are poised for merger and acquisition costs, respectively. HDFC Bank needs to implement its merger with Housing Development Finance Corporation, while Axis Bank has to absorb Citibank India’s retail business that it acquired. Both transactions could be a significant overhang for their respective shares.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/icici-bank-tops-rival-hdfc-bank-in-valuation-multiple-for-first-time-8388041.html
icici,2022-04-18T15:35:05+05:30,Siddhi Nayak,"With interest rates set to go up, Indian banks look to time debt raising","Fund-raising now will help banks take advantage of a lower interest rate given that the RBI is expected to make continuous rate hikes this fiscal year, and also help address growing credit demand. Some banks, including HDFC Bank, have already received board approval to raise funds.","Indian state-run and private banks are likely to tap the debt market to raise capital in the coming months, before the central bank embarks on its rate-hike cycle, top analysts and bankers told Moneycontrol on April 18. Among the banks that plan to hit markets for funds are ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and some large state-owned banks, according to people familiar with the development.  Banks are charting out their fund-raising plans in anticipation of a hardening corporate bond yield curve as rising inflation worries could prompt the Reserve Bank of India to hike the key repo rate by 25 basis points in the Monetary Policy Committee’s next policy in June. The repo rate is the rate at which the central bank lends short-term funds to banks.  Inflation, measured by retail prices, escalated to a 17-month high of 6.95 percent in March from 6.07 percent in February, driven by high food prices. Market participants anticipate a hardening corporate bond yield curve as rising inflation worries could prompt the RBI to hike the key repo rate by 25 basis points in June.  “What we are likely to witness is an increase in banks’ fundraising in the next few months, before the RBI’s policy,” said Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner at Rockfort Fincap, a Mumbai-based debt advisory firm.  “Moreover, banks are likely to refinance their earlier borrowings in the coming months. A few banks, including Canara Bank and Union Bank, issued perpetual bonds before March to capture the lower interest rates and are likely to continue this fiscal year too, besides other large state-owned banks,” Venkatakrishnan added.  In the April round of the monetary policy review, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had kept the key repo rate steady at 4 percent for the 11th straight time, but had flagged worries over rising inflation. Economists expect retail inflation to stay over the RBI’s tolerance band in the coming months, assuming energy prices remain elevated due to the Russia-Ukraine war. The MPC’s next policy decision is due on June 8.  Also read: What the MPC tells us about RBI’s communication strategy  Early movers  Before the April policy, many banks had already started fundraising assuming a rising interest-rate scenario. For instance, in March, state-run Indian Overseas Bank raised Rs 665 crore by issuing 10-year Basel III compliant Tier II bonds at a coupon of 8.60 percent, according to dealers.  UCO Bank, too, raised Rs 100 crore last month via a similar bond issue at a coupon rate of 8.51 percent. Karnataka Bank sold its 10-year Basel III compliant Tier II bonds at a coupon rate of 10.70 percent last month, dealers added. This is at a premium compared with the 10-year government bond, which currently yields 7.23 percent.  Some banks have already received their boards’ approval for fund raising. On April 16, for instance, HDFC Bank’s board approved a fund-raise of Rs 50,000 crore via bonds. In March, Punjab National Bank’s board had approved raising capital via the issue of Basel III-compliant additional Tier I bonds up to Rs 5,500 crore and Tier II bonds up to Rs 6,500 crore, in one or more tranches.  “The market has already begun to discount a 25-basis-point rate hike by the RBI in the June policy review, and if this happens we are expecting the corporate bond yield curve to harden at least 25 basis points further,” said Ritesh Bhusari, Deputy General Manager, Treasury, at South Indian Bank. “We expect the pain in the corporate bond market to accentuate from here.”  According to Anil Gupta, Vice President &amp;amp; Co-Group Head, Financial Sector Ratings, at rating agency ICRA, as bond yields rise and as the RBI sucks out surplus liquidity from the banking system, not only would corporate bond yields rise but spreads with government securities are also expected to widen in the coming months.  Rockfort Fincap’s Srinivasan expects banks to issue bonds in the 7-year to 15-year segment in the next three months, and spreads to increase by at least 50 basis points compared to the February or March corporate bond traded levels.  The fund-raise during this period could help banks take advantage of a comparatively lower interest rate considering the market expectations of continuous rate hikes by the RBI this fiscal year, and simultaneously help address growing credit demand, Srinivasan added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/with-interest-rates-set-to-go-up-indian-banks-look-to-time-debt-raising-8373961.html

icici,2022-04-08T13:21:18+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,These 10 rate-sensitive stocks look bright as RBI keeps monetary policy on expected lines,Moneycontrol has collated a list of rate-sensitive stocks that may be a good buy at current levels or on dips from a 2-3 weeks' perspective. Returns are calculated based on April 7 closing price.,"The monetary policy announced by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on April 8 was largely on expected lines with the repo and reverse repo rate left unchanged at 4 percent and 3.35 percent, respectively, with an upward revision in inflation and cut in growth forecast, citing the spike in commodity prices due to supply disruptions caused by the Ukraine-Russia war.  The central bank has maintained its ‘accommodative stance’ while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.  Analysts say the RBI has chosen to support growth over inflation by keeping the rates at the same level. “We believe it is a sensible choice because for India to attract foreign capital it will have to focus on generating growth. It has tried its best to balance the sharp increase in inflation forecast and a lower GDP growth forecast,” said Abhay Agarwal, founder and fund manager at Piper Serica.  He believes that the RBI does not want to signal a series of rate hikes that will increase the cost of borrowing and negatively impact the nascent recovery in consumer sentiment, manufacturing and rural income. “The hope is that with supply bottlenecks easing inflation will trend down.” Rate-sensitive stocks including banks, financial services, auto and realty largely remained flat as the policy was on expected lines.  After the sharp increase in oil prices, the key element in the import bill, the RBI has lowered its GDP forecast to 7.2 percent for FY23 from 7.8 percent earlier, while significantly raising the full-year CPI inflation forecast to 5.7 percent from 4.5 percent earlier.  The central bank assumed oil price at $100 a barrel for forecasting economic growth and CPI inflation. “This implies that growth and inflation can be better if crude declines sharply if the war hopefully ends early,” said VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.  The MPC is of the view that since the February meeting, the ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions, generalised hardening of global commodity prices, the likelihood of prolonged supply chain disruptions, dislocations in trade and capital flows, divergent monetary policy responses and volatility in global financial markets are imparting sizeable upside risks to the inflation trajectory and downside risks to domestic growth.  Also read - 10-year bond yield hits 7%, first time since June 2019  Given the cross-current of multiple headwinds, “our approach needs to be cautious but proactive in mitigating the adverse impact on India’s growth, inflation and financial conditions”, said RBI governor Shaktikanta Das while addressing a press conference.  He added that the RBI is, however, reassured by the strong buffers that India has built over the past few years, including large foreign exchange reserves, significant improvement in external sector indicators and substantial strengthening of the financial sector, all of which would help weather this storm. “Once again, we in the RBI stand resolute and in readiness to defend the economy and navigate out of the current storm.”  Das rightly emphasised India’s macro strengths, pointing to the improvement in the external situation helped by record exports, ample forex reserves of $606.5 billion and strengthening of the financial sector, said Vijayakumar.  The RBI has introduced the standing deposit facility (SDF) as a new tool to absorb liquidity. The SDF rate, which will now be the floor of the liquidity adjustment facility corridor, will be at 3.75 percent.

Prior breakout prices consolidated for almost seven trading sessions and we witnessed above-average volume activity during that period, indicating accumulation stage for the counter.

On the broader timeframe, prices are moving out of a symmetrical triangle pattern which is a strong bullish signal.  While looking at the overall price formation and fresh breakout, we are expecting prices to trade higher towards Rs 847 levels.    Expert: Mehul Kothari, AVP - Technical Research at Anand Rathi Shares &amp;amp; Stock Brokers  HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,517 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,450 | Target: Rs 1,625 | Return: 7 percent  After the recent correction, HDFC Bank is hovering near the 61.8 percent retracement level of the entire rally which started from Rs 1,400 to Rs 1,700. This support coincides with the gap area formed due to the merger news.  The support zone is also the placement of the Kijun of Ichimoku indicator. Hence there is a high probability that the stock might resume its uptrend.  Thus, short-term traders are advised to buy the stock in the range of Rs 1,515-1,505 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,450 for the upside potential target of Rs 1,625 in the next two to three weeks.

S&amp;amp;P said the combined entity’s earnings could improve over the next three to five years and the merger will provide the bank with profitable cross-selling opportunities to HDFC’s large pool of customers.  &quot;The merged bank will benefit from economies of scale and an improved ability to raise funds at competitive rates. It can also leverage HDFC Bank’s digital capabilities and distribution network to drive operational efficiencies,” it said.  S&amp;amp;P expects the combined entity’s capitalization and asset quality to be broadly in line with those of HDFC Bank on a standalone basis. S&amp;amp;P expects the combined entity’s capitalization and asset quality to be broadly in line with those of HDFC Bank on a standalone basis.  About 9 per cent of HDFC Ltd’s portfolio comprises loans to real estate developers, where the asset quality is weaker than for the rest of the bank’s portfolio.  &quot;In our view, HDFC Bank should be able to absorb incremental risks from this portfolio given its adequate capital and provisioning buffers,” the US-based rating agency said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hdfc-bank-merger-to-create-entity-twice-the-size-of-icici-bank-sp-global-ratings-8315851.html
icici,2022-03-28T11:37:01+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Top 10 trading picks for next 3-4 weeks as market loses momentum,"The Nifty 50 lost 0.8 percent last week but stayed consistently above the crucial 17,000 mark as well as the 200-day moving average of about 17,030 in the past six straight sessions. The first half of this week will likely give a fair idea of the short-term direction","After a stellar run in the previous two weeks, India’s stock market entered a consolidation phase and there was some profit booking as the key indices declined in four of the five sessions in the week ended March 25. Mounting inflation concerns amid elevated commodity prices including crude oil that climbed above $120 a barrel again and the continuing war between Ukraine and Russia weighed on market sentiment.  The Nifty 50 lost 0.8 percent during the week to close a tad above 17,150 after a 6.4 percent rally in two straight sessions previously. The important point to note is that the index consistently stayed above the crucial 17,000 mark as well as the 200-day moving average (at about 17,030) in the past six straight sessions. There was rangebound trade and mild profit taking, indicating that the level could act as a crucial support, while the upside resistance was at 17,450, above which the index could rise to 17,800-17,900, experts said.  “Let's see how things unfold and if there is no aberration globally, we are most likely to hold the sacrosanct support zone of 17,000-16,900,” said Sameet Chavan, chief analyst-technical and derivatives, at Angel One.  He said the first half of the forthcoming week would certainly give us a fair idea of the short-term direction. Till then, 17,350-17,450 are to be considered as the immediate hurdles.  Apart from that, the broader market did extremely well last week, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices rising 1 percent and 0.25 percent, respectively.  “We expect it to continue in the current week as well. Hence traders can look to identify such potential themes to fetch higher returns,” Chavan said.  Here are the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on March 25 closing prices:  Expert: Nandish Shah, Senior Derivative &amp;amp; Technical Analyst at HDFC Securities  EIH: Buy | LTP: Rs 149 | Stop-Loss: Rs 142 | Target: Rs 165 | Return: 11 percent  The EIH stock price has broken out from a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart with higher volumes. The stock price has also broken out on the weekly line chart where it closed at the highest level since December 2019.  The stock price has been taking support at the 200-day EMA (exponential moving average). Oscillators like relative strength index (RSI) and money flow index (MFI) are placed above 60 and rising, indicating strength in the stock’s current uptrend.  Hotel stocks are looking good on the charts for the short to medium term.    VIP Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 689 | Stop-Loss: Rs 650 | Target: Rs 760 | Return: 10 percent  VIP has broken out on the daily chart with higher volumes where it closed at an all-time high. The stock price has broken out from the symmetrical triangle on the daily chart.  The RSI and MFI are placed above 60 and rising, indicating strength in the current uptrend. The directional indicator (DI) is trading above minus DI, while the average directional index (ADX) line is placed above 25, indicating momentum in the current uptrend.    Mahindra Holidays and Resorts India: Buy | LTp; Rs 234 | Stop-Loss: Rs 220 | Target: Rs 262 | Return: 12 percent  The stock price has broken out from a symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart with higher volumes where it closed at the highest since November 18, 2021. The stock has been taking support at the 200-day EMA over the past couple of months.  The RSI and MFI have witnessed a trendline breakout, indicating a higher possibility of a sharp rise in the price in the coming days. Hotel stocks are looking good for the short to medium term.    Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  ICICI Bank: Buy | LTP: 699 | Stop-Loss: Rs 675 | Target: Rs 735 | Return: 5 percent  After a short-term correction, the stock has formed a higher bottom pattern. The stock has recovered over 10 percent from the monthly lowest level. A promising pullback rally along with a higher bottom formation indicate a further uptrend from current levels.  Currently, the stock is trading above the 20-day SMA (simple moving average). Looking at the overall pattern, it offers a buying opportunity for positional traders with a decent risk-reward ratio. The trend reversal move is likely to continue up to Rs 735.    SBI Life Insurance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,093 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,054 | Target: Rs 1,165 | Return: 6.6 percent  After a medium-term correction, the stock took support near Rs 1,000 and reversed. Post-reversal, SBI Life is holding a higher low formation, which is broadly positive. Currently, the stock is consolidating in the Rs 1,070 to Rs 1,140 range.  The stock completed one leg of correction and promising reversal formation, indicating a strong possibility of a quick pullback rally from current levels.  Unless it trades below Rs 1,054, positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target Rs 1,165. Fresh buying can be considered now and on dips, if any, between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,080 with a stop-loss below Rs 1,054.    Bajaj Auto: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,654 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,529 | Target: Rs 3,900 | Return: 6.7 percent  From the monthly lowest level, the stock rallied over 15 percent. On the daily and intraday charts, the stock consistently formed a higher bottom formation, which is broadly positive.  In addition, after a long time, it closed above Rs 3,650 on the weekly charts. As long as the stock trades above Rs 3,529, the chances of hitting Rs 3,900 turn bright. We expect the uptrend formation to continue unless it slips below Rs 3,529.    Expert: Astha Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Hem Securities  Mindtree: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,281 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,780 | Target: Rs 4,580-4,890 | Return: 7-14 percent  The stock has broken out at about Rs 4,280 after consolidating at the 50 EMA level. The stock has formed a major support level at Rs 3,540.  Volumes are expanding, with the weekly 14 period RSI showing a positive indication, which suggests further strength in the stock price.  The stock can move upwards from here. We recommend a buy with a stop-loss of Rs 3,780 and possible price targets are Rs 4,580-4,890.    Hindalco Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 623 | Stop-Loss: Rs 569 | Target: Rs 690 | Return: 11 percent  On the weekly charts, the stock is trading above all major moving averages. After reaching a high of Rs 551 in October 2021, the stock has gained support at Rs 407 and has moved upwards since.  However, the stock recently broke its previous high and went up to Rs 630. Also, on the daily charts, MACD (moving average convergence divergence) crossed its signal line, which qualifies as a bullish trend in the stock.  We recommend a buy with a stop-loss of Rs 569 and a possible price target of Rs 690.    Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com  Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro Infotech: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,183 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,960 | Target: Rs 6,565 | Return: 6 percent  The IT space is witnessing a gradual recovery post the recent short-term corrective phase. After a pricewise correction, the stock managed to form a support around its ‘200 DEMA’ and has seen some consolidation.  The stock is on the cusp of a breakout from a consolidation on the lower time frame charts and this should lead to a resumption of its uptrend in the short term.  The risk-reward ratio is favourable at current levels to initiate fresh longs and hence, short-term traders should look for buying opportunities in this stock.  Traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 6,180-6,170 with a stop-loss placed below Rs 5,960 and a potential target of Rs 6,565.    Tata Power: Buy | LTP: Rs 241 | Stop-Loss: Rs 233 | Target: Rs 252 | Return: 4.6 percent  The stock managed to consolidate in a range when the broader markets were correcting and hence, has seen a relative outperformance. The longer-term trend for the stock is still positive and the recent consolidation just seems to be a timewise correction within an uptrend.  In the past couple of sessions, volumes have picked up along with the price rise and the short-term moving average (5 DEMA) has given a positive crossover over the medium term (20 DEMA).  The RSI-smoothed oscillator is also indicating a positive momentum. This indicates the probability of a resumption of the broader uptrend and hence, traders should look to buy this stock for the short term.  Traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy the stock in the range of Rs 240-238 for a potential target of Rs 252 in the near term. One should place a stop-loss below Rs 233 on long positions.

Customers of ICICI Direct too complained of issues in the online, mobile platforms. ICICI Direct later tweeted today about the website being down and assured that the glitches will be fixed at the earliest.   An ICICI Bank spokesperson didn't immediately offer a response to queries on digital outage.  &quot;Servers are down for quite some time. Both the website and the app aren't opening for now,&quot; said an ICICI bank official who didn't want to be named.  This isn’t the first time ICICI Bank customers are facing technical glitches. Even in September 2021, there was a downtime on the website for a couple of hours.  Several customers had complained of glitches faced while doing transactions or accessing other banking facilities via internet banking.  Frequent technical glitches on internet and mobile banking platforms have created problem for Indian banks in the recent years.  In December, 2020, the RBI had imposed curbs on HDFC Bank following frequent digital outages.  The curbs were fully lifted recently. On March 11, the RBI acted on Paytm Payments bank preventing it from taking on new customers while ordering a comprehensive IT system audit.  The crackdown on Paytm Payments Bank was based on certain material supervisory concerns observed in the bank, the RBI said.  The RBI hasn’t elaborated on the concerns but as it appears from the statement, the regulator’s discomfort is primarily to do with the IT system.  Experts said the concerns could be over data privacy, Know Your Customer (KYC), data storage, etc.  The bank will now have to appoint an IT audit firm to begin the auditing process and submit a report to the central bank. The lifting of the ban will depend on the audit outcome.  Time  and again, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cautioned banks to invest more on their technology platforms to ensure smooth functioning.  Last year, the RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said banks must invest more in building robust IT platforms to fortify public confidence in digital banking.  “More investment is required by all stakeholders for building robust IT platforms and technologies for operational purposes as well as for fortifying public confidence in digital banking, especially when the financial landscape is rapidly embracing new technologies,” Das wrote in the foreword of RBI Financial Stability Report (FSR).  Acknowledging that information technology platforms and digital payment systems have provided considerable support for business continuity and smooth functioning during the pandemic, Das said digital technologies have been identified as a bright spot in India’s economic prospects. &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/icici-bank-customers-face-glitches-on-icici-net-banking-mobile-app-8275091.html

icici,2022-03-18T13:28:46+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Nine best stocks for your portfolio to secure healthy returns by next Holi,"Here are nine picks (mix of largecap, midcap, and smallcap) suggested by the market experts and portfolio managers that can be added to your portfolio to gain healthy returns by next Holi.","Despite several risks emerged in the second half, the market has delivered solid returns of 19 percent since last Holi festival though it is still 7.5 percent off its record highs reached in October 2021.  Every sector participated in the run with Metal and Power being the largest gainers with 56 percent and 59 percent returns, respectively, followed by IT and Realty that surged 37 percent each. Oil &amp;amp; Gas, Capital Goods, Energy and Healthcare indices gained 16-32 percent, while Auto, Finance and FMCG underperformed others, registering 8-9 percent gains.  Consistent buying by DIIs amid hopes of strong earnings growth and economic growth ahead despite margin pressure in some sectors in the short term on rising commodity prices, and continuity in low interest rate environment still supported the market, though huge FII selling amid expectations of faster policy tightening by global central banks including Federal Reserve, and sharp rising in commodity prices (including oil and metals) and sanctions imposed on Russia by western world after Russian invasion of Ukraine capped the gains in second half.  The broader markets also participated in the run with BSE Midcap index rising 19 percent and Smallcap index climbing 37 percent.  Experts expect the volatility in next few months to continue due to Ukraine-Russia war and sanctions imposed on Russia, but having positive view on the market for the medium-to-long-term perspective, they advised buying quality stocks on every major dip and expect at least 10-15 percent market gains by next Holi.  &quot;The challenge at every stage that will face markets is demand side growth coming through. There will be hiccups at different stages and the reasons could vary (sitting three months back, I do not believe anyone could predict or factor the geo-political risk and oil prices settling above $100 a barrel),&quot; says Naveen Chandramohan, Founder and Fund Manager at ITUS Capital.  He further says rather than worrying about the risks, he would use this macro uncertainty to pick up good businesses which continue to grow cash flows, reinvest capital and gain market share. &quot;There are multiple businesses that are doing this, and our focus would be on the micro.&quot;  Here are nine picks (mix of largecap, midcap, and smallcap) suggested by the market experts and portfolio managers that can be added to your portfolio to gain healthy returns by next Holi:  Expert: Sonam Srivastava, Founder, Wright Research  HDFC Bank  In a rising interest rate environment, banks stand to gain the most as banks and financial organizations have significant cash holdings due to customer balances and business activities that would yield high interest. On a company-specific level, recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lifted all restrictions on HDFC Bank, permitting it to launch new digital initiatives.  As a result, the loan growth has picked up, and an uptick in net interest income (NII) growth is a big positive. We expect a market share in credit cards to stabilize and improve asset quality trends for HDFC Bank.  The bank has a reasonable valuation with high return on equity (ROE) from the valuation perspective. HDFC Bank has maintained a consistent profit growth for many years and has excellent projections.  Tata Elxsi  Tata Elxsi is a multibagger midcap IT stock that outperformed last year. Tata Elexi offers end-to-end engineering solutions to their clients. Tata Elxsi is valued on the pricier side, but the revenue and profit growth is among the highest in the sector for these stocks, and it also maintains a good profit margin.  It has a good ROE and a lot of cash on hand to spend on Capex. Companies across the globe are investing in R&amp;amp;D to produce enticing products, which improves the prospects for an engineering research &amp;amp; development company like Tata Elxsi. Tata Elxsi plans to focus on electric, automated, and connected vehicles (EACV), 5G, Medical Electronics, AI &amp;amp; ML-driven innovative solutions, etc., in the future.  The high-interest rate environment that can inflate the currency Tata Elexi is attractive because of its global exposure.  Tata Steel  Tata Steel has been the buzzing stock for the last year due to the upcycle in metal prices. Tata Steel is one steel sector stock that has outperformed all others. With the rising profitability due to rising steel prices, Tata Steel has cleared a lot of debt from its balance sheet and deleveraged.  The Russia Ukraine crisis has also made this stock attractive as it is serving as an alternate to the Russian-made steel for European customers. Tata Steel has a significant European presence, contributing to a bulk of revenues.  In terms of fundamentals, the valuations are below the industry average, and the profit growth has been exceptional. We expect Tata Steel to have robust prospects with a global focus on infrastructure.  Expert: Divam Sharma, Founder at Green Portfolio  Valiant Organics  The larger the distortion the more attractive the stock is. Valiant Organics has been a story we have been following for several years that is in the specialty chemicals space.  The fundamentals of the company have continuously unravelled, and yet the price has been on a decline. Zooming in, the company is producing negative cash, because the revenues are being ploughed into capex, and this capex will prove to be of tremendous value when the manufacturing begins in these new plants.  Most if not all the capex is oriented to manufacturing chemistries that are in direct competition to what China has been supplying. Solid margins, low debt, extremely comfortable valuations, and upcoming capacity ramp-up support our overall thesis.  KSB  KSB is an MNC available at comfortable valuations. The company manufactures pumps and valves for various industries.  The compelling rhetoric is the utility of these pumps. One of the segments their pipes find utility is in the FGD (flue gas desulphurization system) and nuclear space. The installation of FGD pumps in coal-powered plants is a necessity now and the company staging themselves to be a large beneficiary with the timely capex.  With the company's steady and strong order book; up trending fundamentals; healthy cashflows; and double-digit margins, we have a high conviction on its long-term performance.  Adani Wilmar  Adani Wilmar commands an 18.3 percent market share in edible oil. The company is the biggest oleo synthetic producer in India.  Considering ambitious plans, we expect food and industry essential business to grow for the company over the coming quarters. The stock looks attractive at current valuations.  Expert: Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services  ICICI Bank  ICICI Bank continues to witness strong growth in retail deposits and has succeeded in building a robust liability franchise over the past few years.  The bank enjoys one of the lowest funding costs among private banks, which enables it to underwrite profitable business without taking undue Balance Sheet risk.  We expect slippages to moderate significantly over FY22-24 and credit cost of 1.2 percent and 1.1 percent in FY22 and FY23 respectively for ICICI Bank.  ICICI Bank continues to remain top pick in the sector given its journey to deliver solid return ratios and growth.  Macrotech Developers  Lodha is one of the largest real estate developers in India, benefitting from the recent demand pick-up and the optimism behind the expected upcycle.  Macrotech Developers is expected to benefit from: a) its around Rs 20,000 crore of completed and near-complete inventory, b) Rs 4,000 crore of QIP money to enable healthy JV/JDA (joint venture/joint development greement) deal addition, c) monetization of industrial land banks and ready commercial projects, and 4) substantial deleveraging potential through robust cash flow.  Lodha is our top pick for its favourable balance between growth potential, improving financial strength, and compelling valuations.  Zensar Technologies  The deal pipeline is strong, comprising a large number of small- and medium term deals, and the management is confident about the deal momentum given the rich demand environment.  The management expects the EBITDA margin to remain in the mid-teens for the next 3–4 quarters before reverting to the high teens as the strategy execution is completed. It further highlighted that decreasing reliance on sub-contractors would be another margin lever.  The addition of 1 client each in the $10 million+ and $20 million+ buckets in Q3 indicates Zensar's progress in diversifying its client base. Since Ajay Bhutoria assumed the reins as CEO, Zensar has doubled its $20 million+ accounts to 4 that was stagnant for last 4 years. Reducing exposure to its top client is also a positive as this lowers the concentration risk.  We believe that its new sales-led strategy should help the company return to the high-teen organic growth path in FY23. We estimate USD revenue growth of 21.8 percent for FY23, up from 15.4 percent in FY22, led by sustained deal inflow and a good exit to FY22.

icici,2022-03-04T10:32:49+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"Axis Securities picks 7 large-caps, 5 midcaps, 4 small-caps after Ukraine-Russia-led correction","Commodities will be the biggest gainers and as long as the geopolitical heat continues, it will be the dominating market theme, Axis Securities said.","The significant fall in share prices over the past one-and-a-half-months when most sectors declined in double digits offers investors an opportunity to buy stocks of quality companies.  Margin pressures reflected in corporate earnings for the December quarter due to rising commodity prices, expectations of faster policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve, relentless selling by foreign investors, and the geopolitical tensions with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine weighed on market sentiment.  The benchmark BSE Sensex fell 11 percent during January 17-February 24 before a minor recovery, while the BSE Midcap index dropped 15 percent and the Smallcap index plunged 18.5 percent.  Among sectors, auto, capital goods, energy, healthcare, IT, consumer durables, oil &amp;amp; gas, and realty declined 10-20 percent, while banking, FMCG and power fell 7-9 percent.  Volatility hit the highest level since May 2020, with the India VIX going up to about 30, indicating instability in the market unless the geopolitical risk eases.  The Russia-Ukraine crisis, which continues for the time being despite sanctions imposed by western countries, poses a threat to earnings and economic growth, given the rise in commodity prices, experts said.  Brent crude oil futures, the international benchmark, hit $120 a barrel on March 3, the highest level since 2012 and a rise of 69 percent in more than two months.  Inflation, growth risks  “This would be a negative factor for global trade, posing a downside risk to the global economic growth,” Axis Securities said. “A scenario of oil sustaining above $100 a barrel for some more time will create notable challenges to the oil-importing countries, especially India, which may find it difficult to maintain the trade deficit and the foreign exchange reserves.”  The brokerage said the rise in crude oil prices could delay the cool-off in inflation in the domestic market, which was expected to moderate in the second half of 2022.  However, in the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, commodities would be the biggest gainers and as long as the geopolitical heat continues, it will be the dominating theme in the market, Axis Securities said.  Apart from the current geopolitical issue, upcoming events in March include the Federal Reserve meeting and assembly elections results from five states.  “The direction of the oil prices, bond yields, and dollar index along with the development of the current geopolitical events will further drive the market fundamentals,” the brokerage said, adding that once the dust over the Russia- Ukraine conflict settles, the market is expected to refocus on key events such as inflation and the number of rate hikes in the current calendar year.  Despite the current volatility, the brokerage maintained its Nifty target of 20,200 with a positive long-term view on the market supported by the emerging favourable structure as increasing capital expenditure enables banks to improve credit growth.  The Nifty closed at about 16,500 on March 3. To achieve the target of 20,200, it needs to add 3,700 points, or 22.4 percent, by March 2023. The index touched a record high of 18,604 in October 2021.  The brokerage said the overall boost in the Union Budget 2022-23 expenditure will help deliver broad-based growth in FY23.  Though the earnings momentum has been strong in the past few quarters and largely in line with expectations for the current quarter, they remain the critical factor for the market, said Axis Securities, which foresees FY22, FY23 and FY24 Nifty EPS at Rs 728, Rs 844 and Rs 918, respectively, with a 20 percent CAGR growth over FY21-24.

Around 60 of both former and existing employees are eligible for the buyback, the startup added.  The Tiger Global-backed startup currently provides a Visa card focused on millennials which allows customers to pay for their purchases in three instalments. Slice's card issuance spiked from 20,000 in January 2021 to 200,000 per month currently led by the growing appetite for credit in India.  Slice founder and CEO Rajan Bajaj said, &quot;Our team's relentless passion and hard work has been instrumental in our rapid growth.

icici,2022-02-10T16:25:22+05:30,Priyanka Iyer,"New Umbrella Entity applications under evaluation, clarifies RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das","The RBI had received applications from around six consortiums in March 2021 to set up a retail payments management, clearing and settlement entity to rival the NPCI.  ","The New Umbrella Entity (NUE) which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had accepted applications for in March 2021 is delayed, but the plan is still on, clarified Governor Shaktikanta Das.  After applications poured in from consortiums comprised of top conglomerates, payments players and banks, RBI has shared no updates on the evaluation of the applicants.  &quot;I agree there has been some delay on that. That is primarily because the same officials who are dealing with that issue (NUE) are preoccupied with other works. We are evaluating it,&quot; said Das in his interaction with the media after the monetary policy announcement.  The NUE, like the NPCI is supposed to be responsible for setting up, managing and operating new retail digital payment systems. It will also manage clearing and settlement systems and undertake initatives to strengthen the digital payments ecosystem in the country. The RBI has received applications from around six consortiums for setting up the entity.  The first consortium includes Facebook, Google, SoHum Bharat along with Jio Platforms. The Tata Group, too, is leading a consortium with Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, Airtel Digital, Flipkart, Mastercard and PayU.  The third consortium includes e-commerce giant Amazon, with ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Visa, Pine Labs and BillDesk. Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma had confirmed that the payments player is also in the fray with Ola Financial, Policybazaar, IndusInd Bank, among others.  However, there have been a few concerns around the data storage and localisation norms, besides the lack of clarity on what revenue model will the new entity have.  NPCI functions as a not-for-profit organisation and both the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and RuPay debit cards attract Zero-MDR as per government norms, i.e. banks, payment service providers, UPI players and NPCI do not earn any share from transactions through these modes.  A competing entity charging MDR for any different products may not be able to compete, and will have to adhere to the Zero-MDR norm if it decides to share the load of UPI transactions, according to industry sources.  &quot;There is still some clarity needed on the revenue model. If there is no revenue, how will there be competition? Plus, there are concerns around the data security and storage norms. So that is why there has been a delay, these questions are on the minds of the regulator as well as applicants,&quot; said a source within the banking industry on the condition of anonymity.  According to the draft framework by the RBI, the NUE shall have a minimum paid-up capital of Rs 500 crore and no single promoter or promoter group shall have more than 40 percent investment in the capital of the NUE. A minimum net worth of Rs 300 crore shall be maintained by the entity at all times.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/new-umbrella-entity-applications-under-evaluation-clarifies-rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das-8072391.html

icici,2022-01-24T14:29:51+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan,Rama Bijapurkar on ICICI Bank insider trading: Was an inadvertent error,"Bijapurkar resigned as an independent director from the ICICI Bank board, citing likely conflict of interest and now reportedly faces a probe by market regulator Sebi.  ","Marketing consultant Rama Bijapurkar, who resigned as an independent director of ICICI Bank last week and now reportedly faces an insider trading probe, said the purchase of the lender’s shares against the rules was due to an “inadvertent error.”  “It was an inadvertent error, which I disclosed to the company as soon as I became aware of it,” Bijapurkar told Moneycontrol on January 24 in response to a set of questions. “I confirm that I am complying with all requirements pertaining to this.”  Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is probing the trades of Bijapurkar to see if she violated insider trading rules, The Economic Times reported.  Bijapurkar’s independent financial adviser purchased 4,900 equity shares of ICICI Bank in her account on January 5 “without prior intimation to her” when the trading window for company insiders was closed, ICICI Bank told the stock exchanges on January 22, a day before her resignation became effective.  Resignation from the Board  Bijapurkar, who advises companies on market strategy and consumer behaviour, resigned from the ICICI Bank board effective January 23, citing a likely conflict of interest between her position on the board and her professional activities and associations with financial services companies.  “I have recently been given to understand by management that my teaching activity in the area of market and business strategy at an educational institution with which I am associated and my research activities on India’s consumer economy at a not-for-profit research centre with which I am associated, which may require me to occasionally engage with other financial service companies or the investor community, could be in violation of the conflict of interest policy of the Bank and the regulator—even in the event of no direct remuneration being earned,” Bijapurkar said in her resignation letter dated January 20.  “In order to avoid any possible ambiguity on my position at any future date as a result of these activities, I have decided to step down,” Bijapurkar said in the letter.  Bijapurkar made no mention of the shares purchased when the trading window for company insiders was closed.  “I want to confirm that there is no other material reason for my resignation other than the one mentioned above,” Bijapurkar said in the letter.  “That is exactly factual too,” Bijapurkar told Moneycontrol, without elaborating.  In its stock exchange notification, ICICI Bank cited Bijapurkar’s letter to assert that there was no other material reason for her resignation.  “Ms. Bijapurkar in her letter has also confirmed that there is no other material reason for her resignation other than the one mentioned in the resignation letter,” ICICI Bank said in the notification dated January 21.  ICICI Bank referred to the purchase of shares only in a subsequent exchange filing on January 22. The bank said it fined Bijapurkar Rs 2 lakh.  When contacted on why ICICI Bank took more than two weeks to inform exchanges about Bijapurkar’s January 5 purchase of shares, a spokesperson said the bank could do so only after its audit committee met on January 22.  Sebi’s insider trading rules bar people in possession of price-sensitive information from trading—and benefitting—in a company’s shares when the trading window is closed for insiders ahead of quarterly results. This list includes independent directors.  ICICI Bank reported better-than-expected earnings on January 22.  Suhail Nathani, managing partner, economic laws practice, said the Prohibition of Insider Trading regulations have a presumption of guilt for trades that are done outside of the trading window.  “This is not the first time that a transgression like this has been found where a portfolio manager’s act has become a breach by the director. The question that begs consideration is whether for independent directors, some threshold or safe harbour can be prescribed under the regulations,” Nathani said.  Who is Bijapurkar?  Bijapurkar is a well-known independent consultant on market strategy, according to her website.  She is also an independent director on the boards of Nestle India, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise, Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra Financial Services, Cummins India and VST Industries, ICICI Bank said in its notification to the stock exchanges.  She has also served on the governing councils of the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India, Insurance Information Bureau, and Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and is on the eminent person advisory group to the Competition Commission of India.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rama-bijapurkar-on-icici-bank-insider-trading-was-an-inadvertent-error-7975931.html

Catch all the market action on our live blog  Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company post December quarter earnings:  Prabhudas Lilladher  We believe that bank’s growth momentum will continue in 4Q as well given 1) Lower slippages of Rs 40.2bn (annualized 2.1% of loans) were reported with improvement in economic activity, 2) Asset quality metrics have held up well with strong recovery/upgrades, PCR maintained at 80%, 80bps of COVID contingency provisions (despite w/back Rs10.5bn) and restructuring book at 120bps, and 3) Strong franchise strength is reflected via solid growth both in liabilities &amp;amp; assets with much better managed risk, which keeps ROEs to move towards +15% in FY23 &amp;amp; FY24.  We maintain our conviction at buy with revised target price of Rs 906 (from Rs 819) based on 2.6x Sep-23 ABV and subs value of Rs 186 (from Rs 181).  Arihant Capital  We continue to maintain our positive stance on the bank led by its leveraging digital capabilities, gaining market share position, strong liability franchise, sharp reduction in NPA and faster adoption of technology.  We increase our FY22 earnings estimate by 9% to factor in the lower credit cost. We maintain our buy rating on the stock with a revised SOTP based target price of Rs 968 (Rs 942 earlier), based on 2.6x FY24E P/ABV for standalone bank and Rs 163 for subsidiaries  Motilal Oswal  The steady mix of high-yielding portfolio (Retail/Business Banking) and a low-cost liability franchise is fueling steady NII growth. The bank is seeing a strong recovery in business trends across key segments such as Retail, SME, and Business Banking.  Fresh slippages have ebbed leading to continued moderation in credit cost, while PCR remains the best in the industry at ~80%. The additional COVID-19 provision buffer (79bp of loans) renders further comfort.  We raise our FY22E/23E earnings by 3%/4% and estimate the bank to deliver an improved FY24 RoA/RoE of 2.0%/17%, respectively.  We maintain our buy rating with and SoTP-based target price of Rs 1,100 (based on 3x FY24E ABV), implying 37% potential upside. ICICI Bank remains our top pick in the sector.  LKP Research  We expect its loan book to grow at CAGR of 19% over FY21-23E, led by technology initiatives. The credit cost normalization is underway.  We estimate return ratio ROA/ROE of 1.9% and 15.8% in FY22E. We value the standalone entity at 3.3xFY23E BVPS (Rs 278) and investment in subsidiaries and JVs (Rs 127 per share); we arrive at a revised target price of Rs 1,045. We recommend a buy with a potential upside of 30%  Credit Suisse  Research house has maintained outperform call and raised the target price to Rs 930 from Rs 900 as it believes growth leadership will help company to sustain re-rating.  It raise 2022E EPS by 4.4% on lower credit costs and better fee growth and remains the preferred pick.  JPMorgan  Foreign broking firm JPMorgan has kept overweight call on the stock with a target at Rs 930 as company can continue to drive steady low-risk returns with consistent EPS compounding.

SIBs are perceived as banks that are 'too big to fail (TBTF)'. This perception of TBTF creates an expectation of government support for these banks in times of distress.

Based on data collected from banks as on March 31, 2017, HDFC Bank was also classified as a D-SIB.  The current update is based on data collected from banks as on March 31, 2021.  The framework for dealing with D-SIBs was issued in July 2014.  The framework requires the RBI to disclose the names of banks designated as D-SIBs starting from 2015 and place these lenders in appropriate buckets depending upon their Systemic Importance Scores (SISs).  Based on the bucket in which a D-SIB is placed, an additional common equity requirement has to be applied to it.  The Additional Common Equity Tier 1 requirement as a percentage of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) in case of SBI is 0.6 per cent, and 0.2 per cent for ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-icici-bank-hdfc-bank-continue-to-remain-systemically-important-banks-rbi-7899151.html

","Employees of ICICI Bank will increasingly get assessed on overall performance and growth of the bank than individual targets or performance.  It means collective performance is more important than individual performance for the bank. It also means, a bell curve based performance assessment to chart out employee appraisal benefits gives way to a wholistic 360-degree performance of all.  “We are increasingly talking about 360-degree performance as a bank. Bell curve is the other side of this,” said an executive familiar with the development.  “If a team is in charge of corporate loan, there is nothing that stops them from talking to the client about, let’s say salary accounts. Individual target is not everything. It’s a wholistic approach,” said the person on condition of anonymity.  The decision indicates salary increment and compensation benefits will have a direct link with the overall performance and growth of the bank.  In fact, ICICI Bank indicated so during analysts’ calls in the past few months and underlined the importance of the so called 360-degree focus on growth and customer needs.  “We aim to create holistic value propositions for our customers through our 360-degree customer-centric approach and focus on opportunities across client and segment ecosystems,” according to the call transcript of an analysts’ call in October following declaration of the Q2 result of FY22.  “We have talked about the fact that we look at customer 360 and so we don’t look at just a single product in most of the instances now. When we give out a home loan, we also have the customer opening their savings deposit with us and this is true across all the products. The customer 360 is a very key thing for us and similarly looking at the entire ecosystem, be it a corporate ecosystem or any other ecosystem that we focus on,” according to the same analysts’ call transcript.  Employee expenses increased by 21.2% year-on-year, the bank had said after the Q2 results. ICICI Bank had slightly over 100,000 employees as of 30 September, 2021.

Hence, valuation correction is on cards, and we expect the Nifty 50 to either be rangebound or correct 1,000 points until the Budget,” Bhatia said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.  The rally that Indian shares saw in the first half of the year was because the market had already priced in a recovery in economic growth and that benefitted all sectors, including airlines and tourism.  Check out all the live market action here.  “So, any negative news related to the Omicron variant of COVID-19 or negative growth would warrant a correction in the market,” he said.  The Nifty has risen more than 22 percent year-to-date despite the second wave of COVID-19, which caused a severe healthcare crisis in the country.  “In emerging markets, India is at the peak in terms of valuations, and there are better plays elsewhere,” Bhatia said. If the US Fed taper gathers momentum in the first two quarters of the next year, then all emerging markets would see outflows, he said.

The negative outlook comes despite the agency recently revising upwards the operating environment outlook of domestic banks to stable from negative, citing better than expected recovery in business and economic activity following the COVID-19 second wave.  Economic momentum and regulatory measures should support modest improvements in the domestic banks’ financial profiles over the next 12-24 months, even though challenges remain the agency said in a late Monday note.  Listing the key rating drivers, the agency said ICICI's long term rating of 'BB+' is support driven and linked to India’s sovereign rating (BBB-/Negative).  This is due to its size and systemic importance, which stem from its large and growing market share (6.1 per cent of system assets and 5.5 per cent of deposits in FY20 and a sizeable retail deposit base).  ICICI is a systemically important bank, and the state has a record of supporting such banks, although ICICI has not required support to date. And the March 2020 rescue of Yes Bank, a mid-sized private-sector bank, reinforces our view.  The negative outlook on the ratings mirrors the agency’s outlook on the sovereign rating, it said. In the view of the agency, the bank’s risk profile has a stronger impact than the operating environment on the assigned viability rating than what the weighting would suggest.  The bank’s appetite for risk, even though it is lower than before the pandemic, has weighed on its financial metrics in the past several years, particularly in terms of asset quality and earnings.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/fitch-affirms-icici-bank-rating-with-negative-outlook-7776451.html

The case was registered on the basis of a complaint lodged on July 13, 2021 by Vishal Sharma, 48, director of Hotel Horizon Pvt Ltd, located at Juhu Tara Road.  Sharma alleged that the accused bankers, ARC and others caused the loss of Rs 120 crore to him since 2011, when he had first applied for a loan of Rs 351 crore. EOW officers had said Sharma tried to avail the loan by mortgaging properties worth Rs 1,200 crore.  As per the economic times report, one of the former bank officials, who is now employed by another institution, was recently summoned by the EOW to provide details of transactions.  &quot;The senior executive was called in to explain certain banking procedures pertaining to sanctioning of loans, functioning of the credit committee and the process of roping in an ARC. The said executive joined the probe on Tuesday,&quot; a senior official with the Mumbai police told the daily.  The EOW has maintained that the executive is not being treated as an accused and was summoned only to explain the banking procedures, however, the FIR registered by the complainant Sharma with the BKC police station alleges fraud.  Sharma had alleged in the complaint that the accused bankers informed him that his loan was sanctioned, and that the amount would be disbursed in phases. He was informed of getting of Rs 25 crore in the first phase, but the bank deducted Rs 15.5 crore from the loan amount as processing fees and Sharma only received Rs 9.5 crore.  In June 2016, Sharma alleged that he was coaxed by the bank officials to pay Rs 47.37 crore.  &quot;In the event this amount isn't paid then the processing fee amount and interest won't be returned.&quot; the FIR accessed by the daily reads.  Later, in September 2016, the loan was sold to an ARC.  &quot;The accused bank officials doctored minutes of the credit meetings, issued false statements and subsequently sold the loan to an ARC without my knowledge. While my liability was of Rs 9.5 crore, the ARC in connivance with the bank officials staked a claim of Rs 120 crore from my mortgaged assets which is worth over Rs 1200 crore,&quot; Sharma told the daily.  Earlier, SBI ex-chairman Pratip Chaudhuri was also arrested on November 1 in connection with an alleged loan scam related to the sale of a hotel belonging to the Godawan Group in Jaisalmer -- which is a non-performing asset (NPA) -- to Alchemist ARC.  Chaudhuri was arrested following a petition filed by former directors of the hotel property with the Chief Judicial Magistrate - Jaisalmer. The director accused him of facilitating the sale of the Rs 200-crore property at a throw-away price of Rs 25 crore to Alchemist ARC, after the SBI had seized the hotel following a default on loan.

But the sharp sell-off continued in the broader space as the Nifty Midcap 100 index corrected 1.7 percent and Smallcap 100 index fell 2.34 percent with weak market breadth.  The BSE Sensex gained 145 points to settle above 60,950 levels, and the Nifty50 closed above 18,100 mark, up 10.50 points, after showing recovery of over 150 points from day's low.  Banking and financials led the market higher and supported for second straight sessions, while FMCG, IT and auto corrected sharply.  Stocks that were in focus include ICICI Bank, which was the biggest gainer in the Nifty50 as well as in the F&amp;amp;O segment, hitting a record high of Rs 867 before closing with gains of 10.85 percent at Rs 841.70 after healthy September quarter earnings.  Multiplex chain PVR was the second biggest gainer in the F&amp;amp;O segment, hitting fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,768.05 and finally settled at Rs 1,727.40, up 6.14 percent. KEC International hit the highest ever level of Rs 541.70, before closing with 7.03 percent gains at Rs 526.35.  Here's what Vikas Jain of Reliance Securities, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  PVR  The stock has witnessed a breakout above its 200-week average with strong volumes and positive price action.  RSI (relative strength index) is also above the higher band of 70 levels and will continue to outperform in line with the price action.  Any decline near to the recent lows of Rs 1,595-1630 levels would be a good opportunity to add longs near to all-time high of Rs 2,000 levels. We advise to hold the stock.    ICICI Bank  The stock scaled an all-time high with strong volumes on the back of good quarterly numbers.  It was trading in a narrow range over the past three months and the confluence of averages has given a breakout above Rs 740 levels.  We would recommend holding for a higher target of Rs 900 in the current momentum from current levels.    KEC International  The stock is one of the consistent outperformers in the capital goods sector and scaled a new high in the current momentum.  RSI has inched upwards to 79 levels and risk reward is not in favour of longs as the recent up move is sharp.  We recommend to book profits in higher range of Rs 550 levels over the next few days.

Catch all the market action on our live blog  Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company post September quarter earnings:  Credit Suisse  The research firm has kept outperform call. It raised the target price to Rs 900 and also raised FY22-24 EPS estimates by 6-9% on stronger NIMs.  The rising core profitability coupled with lower credit costs drive up the RoE, while CET remains strong at &amp;gt; 17% &amp;amp; will allow for continued growth.  Credit Suisse expect credit cost to normalise &amp;amp; RoE rise to 15%+.  Goldman Sachs  Research house has maintained buy call and raised the target to Rs 829 from Rs 773 after company’s PAT was in-line, while underlying quality &amp;amp; future visibility were better.  It increases FY22-24 profit estimates by up to 5% after bank delivered a return on assets of 1.8% this quarter.  The company is set to achieve RoA at closer to 2% &amp;amp; RoE of 16.5% over FY23-25.  CLSA  Broking house CLSA has maintained buy call and raised the target price to Rs 1,100 from Rs 1,000 as bank now consistently delivering sector-best growth.  The recent asset quality trends indicate credit costs will likely undershoot. With further 3%-5% earnings upgrade, it expect return on risk-weighted assets.  Morgan Stanley  The brokerage house has kept overweight call and raised the target to Rs 1,025 from Rs 900 as company remains a top pick.  The net impaired loan formation dropped sharply &amp;amp; core PPoP was a surprised. The traction on various digital initiatives remains strong.  Motilal Oswal  ICICI Bank reported a strong 2QFY22, led by strong core PPOP performance, controlled provisions, and robust asset quality, with NNPA ratio (less than 100bp) at the lowest level since Dec’14.  The bank is seeing a strong recovery in business trends across key segments such as Retail, SME, and Business Banking. The Retail and Rural segment is showing robust trends, barring Commercial Vehicles.  On the asset quality front, slippages have moderated, and the management expects 2HFY22 to be much better. Provision coverage ~80% remains the best in the industry.  We maintain our buy rating with a revised SoTP-based target price of Rs 1,000/share (2.8x Sep’23E ABV for the bank). ICICI Bank remains our top pick in the sector.  Elara Capital  Back to back strong earnings over the last four quarters give us the confidence that strong traction in loans, NIM, fees is sustainable.  We increase earnings by 11-13% and revise our target multiple to 3x from 2.8x. Our new target price is Rs 1,000.  We expect RoA of 1.9% in FY23E for ICICI Bank versus 1.8% in Q2FY22. With strong traction in earnings, focus on granular growth and improving digital footprint, we expect the stock to re-rate to 3x PBV.  LKP Research  We expect its loan book to grow cautiously at CAGR of 16% over FY21-23E, led by balanced growth across segment. In our opinion, the bank’s credit cost will normalise by FY22E and estimate return ratio ROA/ROE of 1.6% and 13.6% in FY22E.  We value the standalone entity with 3.4xFY23E BVPS (Rs 267) and of investment in subsidiaries and JVs (Rs 113 per share); we arrive at a revised target price of Rs 1,020 (Rs 780 earlier).

On the market, he feels indices might halt for some time and might continue to head towards new lifetime highs. &quot;65,000 mark on Sensex by Diwali will be difficult to mount, however we might see these levels by Budget 2022,&quot; he said in an interview to Moneycontrol's Sunil Shankar Matkar.  Gaurav Garg, who has more than 10 years of experience across industries and is actively involved in valuation of companies through various valuation models and developing market research reports, expects gap up opening in Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank on October 25.  What is your reading on September quarter earnings that have been announced so far? What are the top five companies that beat your earnings expectations by a wide margin and missed sharply respectively, and are you bullish on those stocks?  Q2FY22 earnings have largely been in line with the market expectations, however, what is concerning is the higher COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) which has impacted margins of many companies including giants like Asian Paints.  Mid cap IT companies including L&amp;amp;T Technology services, L&amp;amp;T Infotech along with biggies like HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries and Infosys have shown decent performance on earnings. On the other hand, TCS, L&amp;amp;T housing Finance, Hindustan Unilever, Sonata Software and HCL Technologies failed to impress the street.  Moody’s upgrades Indian banking system’s outlook to stable from negative. Does it mean that problems faced by banking system are behind now?  Due to Covid-19, asset quality had deteriorated in the pandemic and now the operating environment has improved as the economy recovered fast. This upgrade to stable from negative helped the banking sector in a positive manner. As we are in a low interest regime, banking and financial sectors might do well which in turn will help not only the core banking sectors but also the other rate sensitive sectors which include Real Estate, Automobiles and housing financing as well.  Do you expect major corrections, if any, in the short term that can create panic among investors/traders? Do you think the BSE Sensex can fall below 60,000 mark or can surpass 65,000 mark by Diwali?  In the bull market, 4-6 percent corrections are said to be normal and should be considered as healthy corrections. Indices might halt for some time and might continue to head towards new lifetime highs. I expect the market to trade in the range of 59,800-62,500 in the coming few weeks with a sideways consolidation. The 65,000 mark on Sensex by Diwali will be difficult to mount, however we might see these levels by Budget 2022.  Auto, Metal, Realty, Power and PSU stocks were the real stars in the last one month, reporting double digit gains. Is it the time to turn cautious over these sectors?  I believe there is enough steam left in sectors especially in PSU stocks as they are still worth investing due to lower PE (price-to-earnings) and attractive dividend yield. As far as Metals, Realty and Auto are concerned we might see a short-term halt in these pockets. However, structure is still intact and in the mid to long term they might do well. Power stocks have given splendid returns in the last few months, and I believe the rally will continue amidst power shortages and global demand-supply disruption.  What is your view on Reliance Industries’ Q2 earnings and what could be opening premium for the stock on October 25?  Oil-to-telecom conglomerate, Reliance Industries, declared its earnings on October 22 evening which exceeds street's expectation as revenue from operations grew 49 percent to Rs 1.74 lakh crore in the second quarter which is a decent growth on lower base; consolidated net profit jumped 43 percent to Rs 13,680 crore for the quarter ended September 30 (Q2FY22). Sharp surge in oil prices has benefited the company in a good way. As far as Jio and Retail arm is concerned, company has witnessed stellar performance as earnings came close to pre-pandemic levels on higher footfalls in retail stores along with higher ARPUs (average revenue per user) for telecom business. In my opinion, stock might open with a gap-up of 2 percent-2.5 percent on October 25 morning.  Also read: Reliance Q2 results satisfy as retail shines  Is it the time to take position in Yes Bank after its September quarter earnings? What could be opening premium for Yes Bank on October 25?  Yes Bank has announced strong numbers on both YoY and quarterly basis as it reported a 74.3 percent YoY growth in net profit to Rs 225 crore for the quarter ended September as against an expectation of a net loss of Rs 31 crore. Asset quality has improved as net NPA (non-performing assets) ratio came in at 5.5 percent as against 5.8 percent in the previous quarter. I see numbers to be decent and there is a high chance that we see green ticks on stocks on October 25.  What is your view on ICICI Bank corporate earnings and what could be opening premium for the stock on October 25?  ICICI Bank has posted impressive numbers for the quarter ending September 2021. The core operating profit of the bank i.e. profit excluding provisions, taxes and treasury income grew by 23 percent to Rs 9,518 crore in the quarter ended September 30, 2021 (Q2-2022), NII grew 25 percent YoY and NIM is at 4 percent. Profit after tax also grew by 30 percent YoY to Rs 5,511 crore, there was growth of 17 percent in the total deposits for quarter ending September 30,2021, the average CASA grew 28 percent in Q2-2022. The increasing deposits and especially CASA is expected to place the bank at a favourable position and may lead to growth in its loan portfolio. The net NPA ratio declined from 1.16 percent at June 30, 2021 to 0.99 percent at September 30, 2021 which is lowest since December 31, 2014.  The bank seems to have seen a growth in retail loan portfolio by 20 percent. The SME business, comprising borrowers with a turnover of less than 250 crore, grew by 42 percent year-on-year and as at September 30, 2021. Growth in the domestic wholesale banking portfolio was 14 percent year-on-year. The domestic advances grew by 19 percent year-on-year as at September 30, 2021.  The numbers, therefore, look promising and it may turn out to further improve the prospects of banking and is expected to have a positive impact on Bank Nifty and thereby on the overall market. The stock is expected to open with a gap up of around 2 percent on October 25.

The transactions were carried out with a corporate client through the Bank’s International offices, the bank said in a release.  These transactions indicate the bank’s preparedness towards smooth transition from USD LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) to transactions linked to Alternative Reference Rates (ARR), the bank said.  In January, the Bank executed its first interbank money market transaction linked to SOFR, which was identified as the replacement for USD LIBOR.  “The Bank has been actively working with its clients for seamless transition from LIBOR to ARRs. These transactions are just the start of the move towards the ARRs and we are confident that increasingly Indian corporates will move towards ARR based transactions,” said Anuj Bhargava, Head - Global Clients Group, ICICI Bank.  LIBOR, or London Interbank Offered Rate, is finally bidding farewell from global markets as the global banks are preparing for a transition to a new alternative reference rate (ARR) such as the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR). The transition is already happening to the new benchmark.  LIBOR and SOFR are benchmarks against which global banks mark their transactions. SOFR is linked to US treasury market transactions. LIBOR is the interest rate average submitted by leading UK banks. The transition from LIBOR is confirmed with, on March 5, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issuing a statement announcing the cessation dates for all LIBOR settings.  SOFR is an identified replacement for USD LIBOR which is expected to be phased out at the end of 2021. The sunset for the LIBOR has been triggered by the decision of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK not to compel contributing banks for LIBOR calculation after December 2021.  “With the slew of measures announced by regulators globally, there is an increased shift towards ARR linked products in markets. As the cessation deadline approaches, the liquidity in ARR linked products will increase and ICICI Bank is ready to widen its product suite to meet the customer requirements,” B.

icici,2021-10-04T10:23:15+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Top 10 trading ideas by experts for October series,"After some profit-booking in the past week, stocks are likely to be rangebound in the week ahead, analysts said.","The stock markets took a breather after profit-booking in the week ended October 1. Selling pressure in four of the five sessions dragged the market down from record high of 17,947.65 in the first session of the week and the Nifty 50 finally lost 1.8 percent during the week. The index had advanced in each of the five preceding weeks.  The Nifty 50 closed at 17,532.05 against 17,853.2 the previous week, but ended September with a gain of 2.3 percent.  The India VIX, a measure of volatility, spiked to 19.43 during the week, before settling at 17.2, up 1.7 percent during the week and also rising 18.5 percent in September.  Experts said the market is likely to be rangebound in the coming week, with resistance at near-record high levels and support at about 17,300.  “For the second half of September, we maintained a cautious stance on the market and it moved much more than we had expected,” said Sameet Chavan, chief analyst – technical and derivatives, at Angel Broking. “In such kind of strong bull run, it may not be a wise ploy to stay sceptical. But the kind of time-projections and negative divergence in momentum oscillators we are observing, we would continue with the same.”  He said the overstretched market can surprise any time and reiterated staying light in the market.  “We have already witnessed a glimpse of this possibility this week but structurally, nothing has been dented yet,” he said.  According to Chavan, the upside in the coming week may be capped.  “We do not expect the Nifty to go beyond the sturdy wall of 17,800-17,950. On the flip side, 17,450-17,300 are to be seen as key supports,” he said.  The first sign of weakness would be when the lower range is broken, he said, adding that the India VIX had also spiked up and “volatility could remain on the higher side in the coming week as well.”  Chavan advised traders to stay light and follow strict stop-losses to exit positions.  Here are 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks.

Initially, the stock retraced 50 percent of its previous up-move and then slipped into consolidation. After cementing its position around this key retracement level, the stock finally managed to break out from its recent congestion phase.  With this, we can see prices traversing the key short-term 89-day EMA placed at Rs 245. Since the breakout took place on sizable volumes, we recommend buying for a short-term target of Rs 284. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 241.  &amp;nbsp;    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment expert on Moneycontrol.com are his own and not that of the website or its management.

Most of the banks have reported such outages. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed a ban on new digital launches of HDFC Bank in December last year after the lender reported multiple outages over a two year period.  The ban was lifted in August this year.  The RBI has, time and again, reminded banks about the need to ramp up their technology capabilities to ensure smooth digital transactions.

Among banks, HDFC Bank, the country's largest lender by assets, remained at the top with Rs 8.7 lakh crore market capitalisation, while SBI is at the third spot with Rs 3.81 lakh crore market cap, Kotak Mahindra Bank at 4th (Rs 3.47 lakh crore) and Axis Bank at 5th position (Rs 2.46 lakh crore).  At the time of writing this report, ICICI Bank stock traded at Rs 724.50 on the BSE, up 0.79 percent. Its market cap stood at Rs 5,01,202 crore. The stock hit a record high of Rs 734.85 today.  The stock has consistently been moving upwards despite intermittent consolidation and correction, registering nearly 84 percent gains in last one year.  In terms of returns, ICICI Bank is the second-biggest gainer in the last one year among big banks after State Bank of India that gained 95 percent. Axis Bank rallied 62 percent, HDFC Bank 40 percent and Kotak Mahindra Bank 22 percent in the same period.  The approval to the re-appointment of Sandeep Bakhshi as Managing Director &amp;amp; CEO of ICICI Bank by the Reserve Bank of India on August 24 also aided sentiment. Bakhshi will remain MD &amp;amp; CEO of the country's second largest lender till October 3, 2023.  Experts largely believe the banking sector to outperform with the expected economic recovery, so ICICI Bank should remain a long term investment.  &quot;ICICI Bank, along with large peers such as HDFC Bank, represents a very strong and stable long term value prospect for both retail and institutional investors. Combined with the positive tail winds of the India growth story, and with favourable upturns in India as a value destination for return seeking capital, we can expect the banking sector to continue to outperform, and ICICI should remain a beneficiary of such value growth,&quot; said Utkarsh Sinha, Managing Director at Bexley Advisors.  He further said the RBI approval for Bakshi's extension should also be read positively, but more importantly, ICICI has a long history of pedigreed management. &quot;Short term blips aside, it enjoys a deep bench of talent which should give investors comfort about its long term prospects and continuity in practices.&quot;  Technically, ICICI Bank is trading in an ascending channel. &quot;It has also given a breakout of Cup and Handle formation and has reversed after retesting the breakout line.

Thus, it should not be seen as a short-term extension by the RBI similar to RBL/DCB. Mr. Bakhshi's age is 61 years and so he is eligible to hold the MD &amp;amp; CEO position till the age of 70 years, as per the companies’ act/ RBI policies.. Thus, he would be eligible for at least two more term extensions beyond 2023, subject to his consent and board/shareholder approval. These term extensions will also be within the overall term cap of 15 years for non-promoter MD &amp;amp; CEO/WTD. Under the leadership of Mr. Bakhshi, the bank has seen a major transformation across business and financial parameters. The bank has steered well through the pandemic, building strong provision/capital buffers and is raring to go for growth with a clear focus on sustainable profitability, in our view.

","A debt-ridden branch manager of Axis bank has been sacked after he tried to loot an ICICI bank branch, stabbing the deputy branch head to death.

There is no other person involved as of now,&quot; Virar Police Station Senior Police Inspector Suresh Warade told IANS.  The incident took place around the evening of July 29, after ICICI Bank's Virar East Branch, Mumbai was closed. Most staffers had left for the day, barring two women employees- Deputy Manager Yogita Nishant Choudhary and her cashier colleague Shraddha Devrukhkar.  Dubey drove down from Naigaon to the ICICI Bank Virar East branch, stepped inside, whipped out a sharp weapon and threatened  Choudhary and Devrukhkar, reported IANS.  He ordered them to hand over all the cash and jewellery which he then dumped into a bag and attempted to flee the scene of crime. However both the women started screaming for help and attempted to pin down Dubey who retaliated by attacking them both with the knife several times before breaking free to run out.  By then, a few people from neighbouring shops had gathered who managed to grab hold of Dubey, took the booty-filled bag and kept it in the ATM cabin and summoned the police.  The knife had wounded both the women badly. Devrukhkar, 32, who was hit in the neck and shoulder, is undergoing treatment at a local hospital, informed Inspector Warade. Unfortunately, the other colleague suffered gashes in the throat, shoulder and other parts of her body and succumbed to her injuries eventually.  According to Warade, the accused Dubey had ostensibly run up huge debts of over Rs 1 crore and may have resorted to the shocking heist to clear off his dues, reported IANS.  Axis Bank has taken the matter very seriously and along with sacking Dubey has launched an internal probe into the matter.  &quot;As a responsible institution, Axis Bank has zero-tolerance towards unscrupulous elements and is committed to fully cooperate with the relevant authorities in resolving this issue. We have taken strict disciplinary action immediately,&quot; an official spokesperson told IANS.  ICICI Bank declined to comment on the issue.

ICICI Bank has, so far, issued over two million Amazon Pay-ICICI Bank credit cards, since its launch in October 2018","ICICI Bank, on July 20, announced the launch of a co-branded credit card with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL), continuing its push in the credit cards segment.  Earlier this month, the private sector lender said that it has issued over 2 million Amazon Pay-ICICI Bank credit cards, since its launch in October 2018, making it the fastest co-branded credit card to have crossed this milestone in the country.  The ICICI Bank-HPCL Super Saver Credit Card will offer rewards and benefits to customers on their spend on fuel as well as other categories, while paying electricity and mobile bills, and in departmental stores like Big Bazaar and D-Mart, and e-commerce portals.  The bank said that, typically, similar credit cards offer accelerated benefits on spends in one category alone. “This card breaks that barrier as it enables customers to save on every transaction they make. We believe that this card will empower customers to save more while enjoying the convenience of digital payments,” said Sudipta Roy, Head, Unsecured Assets, ICICI Bank.  ICICI Bank has been among the leading issuers of credit cards in recent months, especially after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) barred its larger rival, HDFC Bank, from issuing new credit cards in December 2020. ICICI Bank held a 70 percent share in new credit cards issued in December 2020.  In FY21, ICICI Bank gained the highest incremental market share of 32.4 percent, followed by SBI Card at 30.6 percent, according to a recent report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL).  ICICI Bank is focusing on the credit card category from the perspective of increasing profits from customers who revolve or stagger their payments, it told analysts on April 24. “The credit card is a very profitable portfolio and on credit card you make some money on spends and some money on revolvers,” said Anup Bagchi, Executive Director, ICICI Bank.  “Our approach is not just growing the book on credit card. We would want to have a healthy mix of making customers primary, having not only large spenders but also episodic revolvers,” Bagchi added.  HDFC Bank, however, continues to be the market leader in terms of card spends. On June 30, the bank said it is preparing to ensure that it takes back the pole position in terms of cards in force and also increases its spend on market share, once the embargo is lifted.  “We’ve utilised our very large sales force and refocused on the portfolio customers and we’ve rescaled and honed our skill sets in terms of being able to manage customer expectations, focusing on a lot of upsell, cross-sell, better customer service, etc.,” said Parag Rao, Group Head,Payments, Consumer Finance, Digital Banking &amp;amp; IT, HDFC Bank.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/icici-bank-continues-push-in-credit-card-space-with-new-co-branded-hpcl-card-7196531.html

icici,2021-07-14T19:19:42+05:30,Ira Puranik,Mid-week crypto catchup: A look at what's happening in the crypto space,"Global stock market indices titan S&amp;P added another cryptocurrency broad digital market index to its existing list of indices, taking the tally of such indicators to 8. Indian legislators also delayed the discussion on the cryptocurrency bill. ","The world of cryptocurrency is bustling with activity this week, both at the home turf and abroad. While global stock market indices titan S&amp;amp;P (Standard and Poor's) added another cryptocurrency broad digital market index to its existing list of indices, taking the tally of such indicators to 8, Indian legislators further delayed the discussion on the cryptocurrency bill which was set to be presented in the monsoon session of parliament. We take a deep dive.   S&amp;amp;P launches Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market Index   Providing a wide, comprehensive measure of tracking the cryptocurrency market, with more than 240 coins in its purview, the broad digital market index was launched on July 13. Currently down by 2.49 percent at 2,864 points, the index’s projected annual returns are over 300 percent.   Edul Patel, CEO, and Co-founder, Mudrex, an algorithm-based crypto trading platform, welcomed the move. He highlighted that this is a positive departure from SEC's (Securities and Exchange Commission) recent denial to approve Bitcoin ETFs, which was deemed short-sighted by many.   “The news about S&amp;amp;P launching a new cryptocurrency index would pave the way for trust-building between the investors and market. Regulatory authorities, the world over, would be closely following this event as it would likely open the gates to mainstream adoption. S&amp;amp;P crypto index would also allow greater transparency in terms of tracking the price of different cryptocurrencies with greater ease,” he explained.   Out of the 8 indices and sub-indices that are associated with cryptocurrency, the S&amp;amp;P MegaCap Index has also attracted attention, for its tracks only Bitcoin and Ethereum, both crypto market leaders with 45.96 percent and 17.15 percent dominance respectively, as per CoinMarketCap.com.  The index launched on May 3, 2021, projected an alluring price return of almost 325 percent over the last year. The returns over the last 1 month (-8.45 percent) and 3 months (-30.72 percent), however, have been dismal. But with S&amp;amp;P’s enduring legacy of tracking various asset classes in the market, it will certainly add value and momentum to cryptocurrency investing and trading.   Gaurav Dahake, Founder and CEO, BitBns also appreciated the move, calling it a testament to the rapidly growing and evolving digital asset market. “Most economies across the globe are opting in positively and there are a lot of structured products that are being offered in the market with banks and regulated financial institutions such as CME, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan introducing them. Once favourable regulations are in place, similar trends are likely to be seen back home as well and we are extremely bullish to witness a thriving ecosystem in India as well,” he said.  India delays cryptocurrency deliberations, again  Seems like the Indian cryptocurrency industry will have to wait a little longer for the much-awaited cryptocurrency bill and a structured ecosystem for it, since the government, indicating different legislative priorities, has not listed it for discussion in the upcoming monsoon session of parliament.   While the government is yet to close in on some final comments and inputs for the bill, many experts are of the view that the country will take a calibrated, moderated approach towards adopting it, allowing it to be traded like any other asset class or commodities in the market instead of an outright ban. Chances of being classified as legal tender in India are also negligible, despite positive precedents set by countries like El Salvador in the recent past in this regard.   “The fact that there's no mention of the cryptocurrency bill among the list of bills to be presented in the parliament shows that the government isn't in a hurry to make a decision. It is a good sign and shows that our lawmakers are deliberating and understanding this technology instead of rushing into it,” opined Nishchal Shetty, Founder, WazirX.   While some see the delay as unforeseen, many also think this delay will significantly enhance the bill in terms of stakeholder inputs and key amendment deliberations, which will further enrich the bill to offer a solid boost to the Indian cryptocurrency system.   Sumit Gupta, CEO &amp;amp; Co-Founder of CoinDCX also thought positively of the delay, hoping for more collaborative and comprehensive legislation as a result.&quot;Crypto investors and entities in the country are keenly following developments on the amended Cryptocurrency Bill with excitement and high expectations. Considering the multiple rounds of discussions that have already taken place between authorities and Indian crypto entities, we are hopeful that the Bill would positively consider the collective feedback and offer an impetus to the entire crypto ecosystem in the country considering the growth potential that it offers,” he noted.   Notably, India offers huge potential and a growing market for cryptocurrencies, given that just over the last year, investments in crypto grew from about $200 million to nearly $40 billion.   ICICI Bank discourages using foreign remittances for crypto investments  The bank hammered another blow to cryptocurrency trades in the country by warning customers to be wary of using foreign remittances to invest in digital assets. It modified its Retail Outward Remittance Application to include a declaration stating that the purpose of the funds is to NOT invest/purchase bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.   In the wake of rising cryptocurrency scams all over the world and the regulatory inability to contain them, owing to ambiguous laws surrounding them, RBI, under its liberalised remittance scheme also introduced a declaration discouraging customers from investing in “units of mutual funds/shares or any other capital instrument of a company dealing in bitcoins and virtual currencies”.  The global trend of rising cryptocurrency frauds is indeed worrying, with the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) reporting around 14,000 investment scams worth $215 million in the first quarter of 2021 alone. Just last month, Haryana Police nabbed four men who were duping people in the name of transacting and investing in cryptocurrencies. ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/mid-week-crypto-catchup-whats-happening-in-the-crypto-space-7172831.html

The second-largest private sector lender also said that the corporates are slower in adopting digital solutions as compared to the retail segment, and added that the solution focuses on tech-based new age offerings.  It can be noted that even before the pandemic, corporate loan growth was trailing for banks, which shifted focus to the more resilient retail segment amid asset quality reverses on the large value loans. Some experts say with demand affected, corporates are unlikely to up their investment activities, which typically result in loan growth.  &quot;…availing the credit for a reasonably good corporate is not an issue today. We are sitting on excess liquidity, credit demand is not much,&quot; ICICI Bank executive director Vishakha Mulye told reporters over a call.  Underlining the importance of the ecosystem approach it has taken, she said a corporate needs a trusted partner, who will handhold and help manage business holistically.  It is newly launched 'ICICI STACK will provide digital banking solutions to corporates, their channel partners, employees, and other stakeholders. The platform is initially available for 15 sectors and also includes eight dedicated 'ecosystem banking' branches in the financial capital (five) and national capital (three).  Mulye explained that apart from generating loan demand, the initiative will help get an entire ecosystem of vendors of corporates to the bank, start salary account relationships and result in other banking relationships on trade finance and transaction banking.  Answering a question on whether it expects revenues from fees or interest income, she said the lender is not looking at it from a line-by-line perspective and expects the initiative to play into the overall profits.  Mulye said 90 percent of the bank's retail transactions have moved away from paper-based systems like cheques and termed the adoption of digital alternatives among corporates as &quot;low&quot;. Corporates have doubled up on digital transactions, but have a long way to go on it, she added.  Asked about the bank's corporate loan demand outlook, Mulye said she feels India will grow after the ravages of the pandemic and the same will come from both investment and consumption. She exuded confidence that in such a scenario the corporate loan demand will also fire up, and added that its corporate loan book is a function of the opportunities in the market.  The bank had witnessed a 13 percent growth incorporate advances in the March quarter as against 20 percent on the retail front, and overall domestic loan growth of 18 percent.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/amid-stuttering-loan-demand-icici-bank-to-offer-holistic-solutions-to-corporates-7043551.html

icici,2021-05-27T14:54:57+05:30,Moneycontrol News,ICICI Bank links UPI ID facility to its ‘Pockets’ digital wallet: All you need to know,The Bank has collaborated with NPCI to link its ‘Pockets’ digital wallet to the UPI network. ICICI Bank is the first in the industry to enable customers to make UPI transactions from their wallet balance instead of their savings account.,"ICICI Bank announced linking a UPI (Unified Payments Interface) ID to its digital wallet Pockets, marking a departure from the current practice that demands such IDs be linked with a savings bank account.  New users, including those who are not customers of ICICI Bank, can now instantly get a UPI ID, which is automatically linked to Pockets. Further, customers who already have a UPI ID will get a new ID when they log on to the Pockets app. This initiative enables users to undertake small value everyday transactions directly from their Pockets wallet using UPI in a safe and secure manner, according to the press release.  It helps them to streamline the number of transactions being undertaken daily from their savings account and thus de-clutter their savings account statement of multiple entries. Further, it expands the convenient usage of UPI to young adults like college students, who may not have a savings account.  The Bank has collaborated with NPCI to link its ‘Pockets’ digital wallet to the UPI network. ICICI Bank is the first in the industry to enable customers to make UPI transactions from their wallet balance instead of their savings account.  ICICI Bank links UPI ID facility: How to use  - A new user needs to download and log in to ‘Pockets’ to start using the facility  -On successful login, a ‘Pockets’ VPA is automatically created based on the registered mobile number of the user. For eg: 9999xxxxxx@pockets where ‘9999xxxxxx’ is the registered mobile number.  -There are no bank account details required for the creation of the UPI ID.  -Further, a user can also modify the auto-created UPI ID to an ID of his/her choice, through the ‘modify’ option under ‘BHIM UPI’ within the app.  -An existing user can update their ‘Pockets’ app to the latest version and get going.  Advantages of UPI-linked ‘Pockets’ are:  Scan and Pay: Users can scan QR codes and make payments at merchant outlets or other locations, through BHIM UPI on ‘Pockets’ app.  Make and receive payments: Customers can use their ‘Pockets’ UPI ID to pay against a collect request sent by another user or app. They can receive money too by creating a collect request through entering a valid amount and the sender’s UPI ID.  Pay to contacts: With this feature, users can seamlessly make payment to their contacts in the phone book.   UPI payments at merchant sites: Users can make payments online at any merchant site by opting to make ‘payment through UPI’ and entering their ‘Pockets’ UPI ID. Once they enter their ID, a collect request is generated which can be accepted on the ‘Pockets’ app to complete the payment.  Money transfers: Customers can seamlessly transfer funds from their ‘Pockets’ wallet to a savings account or any other ‘Pockets’ wallet, by entering the recipient's ‘Pockets’ UPI ID or savings account details.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/icici-bank-links-upi-id-facility-to-its-pockets-digital-wallet-all-you-need-to-know-6945851.html

Bank in past 2-3 years has relentless focus on improving and building a strong operating profitability and simultaneously moving to better rated assets, renewed underwriting &amp;amp; credit delivery and mining of existing franchise strength. This has led to strong loan &amp;amp; low cost deposit growth leading to better risk-adjusted led profitability. Asset quality has been steady with much low corporate stress, while strong growth in retail in last 2-3 years is seasoning the book which should continue ahead. Strong provision buffer of 100bps &amp;amp; PCR maintained at 77% should help credit cost normalize much faster leading to ROEs moving to 15% by FY23 from 13% currently.

icici,2021-05-20T11:23:39+05:30,Allirajan M,Not able to use your debit card for online transactions? Here's why your bank may have blocked it,Banks say the move is in compliance with Reserve Bank of India guidelines,"If you haven’t used your debit card for online/contactless payments for a long time, then it could be de-activated by your bank. Leading private sector banks have started disabling the payment feature in unused cards. The move, they say, is in compliance with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines.  “We have observed that you have not used your debit card for the last two years or more for online payments (E-commerce)/Contactless payments. To prevent any misuse of the card and to comply with the RBI guidelines, these payment features will be disabled after 10 days of this notice,” HDFC Bank said in its mail to customers, recently.  An ICICI Bank spokesperson says, “In line with the regulatory guidelines, we periodically assess risk based on the usage of the debit and credit cards across various channels. Depending on the outcome of the review, we may deactivate the online usage of the card.”  “The sole objective of this exercise is to safeguard the interest of the customer by preventing any fraudulent transaction on a channel which is not used regularly,” the spokesperson said.  What are the RBI guidelines on card usage?  “For existing cards, issuers may take a decision, based on their risk perception, whether to disable the card not present (domestic and international) transactions, card present (international) transactions and contactless transaction rights,” RBI’s circular issued in January 2020 stated. “Existing cards, which have never been used for online (card not present) / international / contactless transactions shall be mandatorily disabled for this purpose,” it further stated.  Also read: How many credit cards should you have?  Will it affect ATM withdrawals, transactions at point of sale (PoS) terminals?  No. The cards have just been disabled for those transactions where your physical card isn’t available. If you wish to make a withdrawal from your ATM or swipe your card at a physical merchant sale points (PoS terminals) as usual, there will be no restrictions.  What happens after the blockage?  If you do not make any new online/contactless payments in the specified timeframe, the bank would automatically de-activate the online payments feature. But there is no need to worry. You can log on to your internet banking service and re-activate the debit card for online transactions.  ICICI Bank allows you to check the status of your cards on the bank’s mobile app. “If needed, the customer can instantly activate the online usage of the card by using the app, internet banking or IVR,” the ICICI Bank spokesperson says.  Also read: RBI increases limit for transactions using contactless cards  Incidentally, payment and banking solution providers offer the technology that allows customers to turn on or switch off their Debit/ATM cards. The usage of cards across ATMs, PoS terminals and E-commerce portals can be restricted as desired, thus preventing any form of fraudulent transactions. Customers can also set channel-specific transaction limits that are lower than those set by the bank.  Why is this being done?  Frauds related to online transactions have been on the rise, especially during the pandemic. The move is expected to minimise fraudulent activities. Therefore, cards unused for certain types of purchases for long are disabled for specific channel transactions. Experts say that this feature helps people in rural areas and senior citizens to protect themselves from frauds. Since the volume and value of transactions made through cards have increased manifold over the years, the RBI has initiated several measures to improve the security of card transactions.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/not-able-to-use-your-debit-card-for-online-transactions-heres-why-your-bank-may-have-blocked-it-6917011.html

The guidance comes as India is crafting a law to ban cryptocurrencies and penalize anyone dealing in them, which would be among the most sweeping crackdowns on the new investing fad in the world. But with the COVID-19 crisis engulfing the country, no one is sure when such a bill may be passed, adding to investors' confusion. Inflation a key risk, but RBI actions to keep g-sec yields under check: Principal AMC The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2018 had forbidden banks from dealing in all transactions related to bitcoin and other such assets. That diktat was challenged by the crypto exchanges and in March 2020, India's top court overturned the RBI ban and allowed lenders to extend banking facilities to them. With investors continuing to rush into the hot new asset class, however, regulators appear to be gearing up for another try.  Thousands of new users are piling into the system every day at a time when the prices of major digital currencies have been on the rise. There are over 10 million crypto investors in India with total holdings of over 100 billion rupees ($1.36 billion), according to industry estimates. No official data is available.  &quot;The regulator has been unofficially asking us that why are we dealing in such business when it is ultra speculative. A lot of money flows overseas via this trade which the RBI is not comfortable with as it may lead to money laundering,&quot; said a senior executive at one of the banks which was contacted. RBI did not respond to a request for comment. Private lender ICICI Bank has already asked payment service companies that it works with to stop all crypto-related payment transactions, three sources said, while other lenders are also following suit.  ICICI Bank did not respond to an email seeking comment. None of the sources wanted to be identified as the discussions with RBI were private and no official order has been issued yet.  &quot;Even though the discussions are informal that is enough. No one wants to go against the regulator,&quot; said another source. The central bank has often voiced its apprehension about digital currencies. Earlier this year, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that they have &quot;major concerns (around crypto) from the financial stability angle.&quot; THE CRYPTO CONUNDRUM With Indian banks increasingly wary of dealing with them, crypto exchanges are scrambling to find new business partners. Axis Bank, Citibank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and others are limiting their exposure to the cryptocurrency market, sources said. &quot;Axis Bank has taken a fairly negative stance against crypto. They are citing internal policy and risk measures and have stopped transactions with crypto exchanges,&quot; said the CEO of a global crypto exchange with presence in India.  IndusInd Bank is also in the process of stopping all crypto-related transasaction, said two sources. Axis, Kotak and IndusInd did not reply to an email seeking comment while Citibank declined to comment.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rbi-tells-lenders-to-re-consider-ties-with-crypto-exchanges-traders-6890071.html

A day earlier, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed a penalty of Rs 3 crore on the private lender for rule violations.  The penalty has been imposed for contravention of certain directions issued by the RBI on ‘Prudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks’, the central bank said in a release.  &quot;This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers vested in RBI under the provisions of section 47 A (1) (c) read with section 46 (4) (i) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (the Act),&quot; the RBI said.  This action was based on the deficiencies in regulatory compliance and was not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers, the RBI said.  The private sector lender on April 24 clocked a 260.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in standalone profit at Rs 4,402.61 crore for the quarter ending March 2021.  The profit in the corresponding period in the previous year stood at Rs 1,221.4 crore.

","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on May 3 imposed a monetary penalty of Rs 3 crore on ICICI Bank for certain rule violations.  The penalty has been imposed for contravention of certain directions issued by the RBI on ‘Prudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks’, the central bank said in a release.  &quot;This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers vested in RBI under the provisions of section 47 A (1) (c) read with section 46 (4) (i) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (the Act),&quot; the RBI said.  This action is based on the deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers, the RBI said.  Explaining the action, the RBI said an examination revealed contravention of the aforesaid directions issued by the apex bank.  In furtherance to the same, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for failure to comply with the directions issued by the RBI.  After considering the bank’s reply to the notice, oral submissions made in the personal hearing and examination of additional submissions made by it, the RBI came to the conclusion that the aforesaid charge of non-compliance with RBI directions was substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty, the central bank said.  In an update to stock exchanges, ICICI Bank said the penalty has been imposed for shifting certain investments from HTM (held to maturity) category to AFS (available for sale) category in May 2017.  The bank had transferred two separate categories of securities on two different dates from HTM to AFS in April and May of 2017, which it believed was permissible as per Master Circular on Prudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks' dated July 1, 2015, the bank said in the exchange note.  &quot;The RBI has held that the shifting of securities the second time in May 2017 without explicit permission was in contravention of RBI directions,&quot; ICICI Bank said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/reserve-bank-of-india-imposes-monetary-penalty-on-icici-bank-6850511.html
icici,2021-04-28T19:39:09+05:30,Dinesh Unnikrishnan,Can big private banks’ aggressive retail bet go wrong?,"Banks are aggressively shifting to retail loans, which makes sense at this point. But, the bet could boomerang if COVID second wave gets prolonged and vaccination drive doesn’t progress as planned.   ","Over the last year, the Indian banking industry has focused on risk mitigation. Major private banks, with a few exceptions, shifted the focus to safer retail assets from high risk corporate loans. This trend has continued in the fourth quarter as well. The common theme in the Q4 earnings report cards of two big private banks—Axis Bank and ICICI Bank—is a clear shift to secured retail advances.  Among the banks, ICICI Bank has grown its retail book more aggressively than its rivals. Analysts call this a timely shift to de-risk the loan book. HDFC Bank, on the other hand, chose to grow its corporate book at a faster pace than retail loans.  Some numbers first  In the case of ICICI Bank, retail book grew by 20 percent year-on-year (YoY) and 7 percent sequentially during the quarter ending March 31, 2021. Retail loans comprised 67 percent of the total loan portfolio at March 31, 2021. In the case of Axis, the retail loans grew 10 percent YoY (year-on-year) and 7 percent QoQ (quarter-on-quarter) and accounted for 54 percent of the net advances of the Bank. Domestic retail loans grew 11 percent YoY and 7 percent QoQ. The share of secured loans was 81 percent with home loans comprising 36 percent of the retail book.  Retail disbursements touched new all-time highs led by higher contribution from secured loan segments. Disbursements in Consumer segment were up 45 percent YoY and 44 percent QoQ, with secured segments like home loans up 73 percent YoY and 45 percent QoQ, and LAP (loan against properties) was up 53 percent YoY and 51 percent QoQ. Compared with this, HDFC Bank has grown its retail book at a slower pace. It's domestic retail loans grew by 6.7 percent and domestic wholesale loans grew by 21.7 percent. The domestic loan mix as per Basel 2 classification between retail and wholesale was 47:53.    Where is the growth coming from?  According to analysts, banks are growing retail books both through fresh business acquisition and buying out or taking over loan portfolios from NBFCs and cooperative banks where rates continue to be high. “These banks offer lower rates. NBFC and co-operative banks provide high cost loans. They are ripe targets,” said Jyoti Roy, analyst at Angel Broking.  Most of the growth is coming from the home loan portfolio. Within retail, home loans are the favourite of banks because of relatively low risk and high margin. Banks have aggressively grown their mortgage book attracting the retail borrowers with lower rates and benefitting from the recent stamp duty cuts. In the case of ICICI bank, home loans form almost half of the retail loans and this chunk has grown 22 percent on a year on year basis.  For Axis, the growth in home loans was 73 percent on YoY basis and 45 percent QoQ. Home loans now comprises 36 percent of the Axis’ loan book.  HDFC Bank, in comparison, has grown home loans by 10 percent YoY and 5 percent on QoQ. Except in HDFC Bank case, both ICICI Bank and Axis have grown their retail book at a much faster pace.  Another reason why big banks are focusing on retail could be lower demand from corporates. Over the last one year, the economic activity has been severely impacted by the pandemic. This has reflected in demand for fresh loans also. The Indian economy is likely to have contracted by 7.5 to 8 percent in FY21. Not just big corporations, demand from small and medium-sized companies too have slowed down over the last one year.  Will huge growth in retail continue?  In the conference call post the announcement of the results, ICICI Bank management said the high growth seen in retail loans may not be continue going ahead. The lender attributed the high growth in Q4 to reasons like stamp duty cuts and benign interest rate environment. Axis Bank too said it will walk cautiously looking at the quality of assets. “We will grow both our secured and unsecured books but the way things are on the ground, we will be cautious on the unsecured loans,” said the management officials at the post result press conference.  Will the aggressive push on retail loans back fire?  Some analysts have sounded caution. “Retail demand is good but can’t say how the asset quality will pan out after a year,” said Siddharth Purohit, analyst at SMC Global securities. &quot;Banks need to be cautious on asset quality,&quot; said Purohit.  Purohit is right. COVID situation is worsening across certain states forcing many states to go into partial or full lockdowns. These include Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka. Prolonged lockdowns can lead to job losses and impact the repayment ability of the borrowers. Last year, the impact of the economic stress was not visible on the bank balance sheets due to the RBI's intervention. The RBI offered support to the banking sector in the form of loan moratorium and restructuring while the government announced an economic stimulus package to fight COVID.  Banks’ aggressive shift to retail assets could boomerang if COVID second wave gets prolonged and vaccination drive doesn’t progress as planned.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/can-big-private-banks-aggressive-retail-bet-go-wrong-6826951.html
