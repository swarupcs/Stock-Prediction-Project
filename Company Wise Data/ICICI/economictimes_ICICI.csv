ICICI,2024-05-02T09:35:00+05:30,ET Online,"'Baseless, misleading': ICICI Bank issues clarification over MD Sandeep Bakhshi's exit",ICICI Bank on Thursday issued clarification over an article stating that the bank's Managing Director (MD) Sandeep Bakshi is willing to leave his position.,"ICICI Bank on Thursday issued clarification over an article stating that the bank's Managing Director (MD) Sandeep Bakhshi is willing to leave his position. The bank denied information regarding Bakhshi's exit published in The Morning Context, a news portal, in an exchange filing.  We would like to categorically deny the information published in the article regarding ICICI Bank’s MD allegedly expressing willingness to leave his position due to personal reasons. This information is figment of imagination and therefore, completely baseless and misleading,  the bank said.  It appears that this rumour is being spread with an ulterior motive and malicious intent in order to harm the Bank and its stakeholders,  it said.The shares of ICICI Bank dipped after opening in green and were trading at Rs 1,146.75 as of 9:53 am (Thursday).The Morning Context article, citing sources, stated that Bakhshi had indicated the will to be relieved as managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank. He has some personal emergency. That is why he wants to step down. The central bank suggested that he work remotely if the need arises, and requested him not to step down,  The Morning Context quoted sources familiar with the matter as saying. Bakhshi's midas touchSandeep Bakhshi's appointment as the leader of ICICI Bank in the summer of 2018 marked a significant shift in the bank's trajectory. Rather than turning to a stern, authoritarian figure to address the turmoil engulfing the institution, the board opted for Bakhshi, a seasoned professional known for his compassionate leadership style.Bakhshi's approach focused on transforming ICICI Bank into a customer-centric organization, prioritising service over mere revenue generation. He aimed to rebuild trust in the bank, shifting away from a bureaucratic culture that hindered efficiency and innovation. One of his key initiatives was to eliminate the pervasive 'eat what you kill' mentality prevalent in banking, fostering a more collaborative and ethical environment.Under Bakhshi's stewardship, ICICI Bank underwent a remarkable turnaround. Despite facing its worst asset quality in a decade in 2018, with soaring bad loans and declining return ratios, the bank made significant strides in improving its financial health. Bakhshi's strategic pivot towards granular retail lending, as opposed to relying solely on bulk corporate loans, paid off. By fiscal 2022, the bank had achieved a seven-year low in gross bad loans and a doubling of return on assets (RoA) to over 2%.The results of Bakhshi's leadership were not only reflected in the bank's financial performance but also in its market standing.ICICI Bank emerged as the second most valuable bank, with its valuation ranking among the best in the industry. The overwhelming 'buy' ratings from analysts further underscored the confidence in Bakhshi's leadership and the bank's prospects under his guidance.RBI approves re-appointmentSandeep Bakhshi's re-appointment as the managing director of ICICI Bank by the Reserve Bank of India in September 2023 underscored his significant role within the institution. His tenure, which began in October 2018 amidst a challenging period for the bank, has evidently been deemed successful, given his re-appointment for another three years.Bakhshi has a long-standing association with the ICICI Group, spanning 37 years since he joined in 1986. His journey from being a wholetime director and chief operating officer to holding the MD post in the company marks his steady progression. Notably, Bakhshi's leadership became pivotal in 2018 when he took charge following the resignation of his predecessor, Chanda Kochhar, amid allegations of financial irregularities. Having held key positions within the ICICI Group, including heading ICICI Lombard General Insurance and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Bakhshi brought a wealth of experience to his role as MD of ICICI Bank. His educational background from XLRI Jamshedpur further complemented his extensive professional journey, adding to his qualifications.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/banking/finance/banking/icici-bank-clarifies-on-article-stating-the-banks-md-willing-to-leave-position/articleshow/109771263.cms

The rally in this stock helped the banking gauge Nifty Bank hit its fresh all-time high of 49,359.90. The 12-stock index shot up by 1260 points on intraday basis.Strong March quarter earnings sparked buying action in ICICI Bank shares.

The interest income earned during the quarter stood at Rs 37,948.36 crore, up 22% YoY. It also announced a dividend of Rs 10/share.Brokerages said ICICI Bank remains the preferred pick in the banking space, given its superior returns profile, top-management credibility, and strong capital/provision buffers.Meanwhile, brokerages' strong approval ratings on the counter was an icing on the cake. Among global brokerages, CLSA raised the target price to Rs 1,350.

ICICI,2024-04-29T13:13:00+05:30,Shivendra Kumar,Sensex surges 941 points: Here are 5 factors which unleashed the bulls,Domestic indices rose on Monday amid buying action in banks and easing crude oil prices and geopolitical tensions. Global markets also lent support to sentiments back home.,"Indian headline indices returned to their winning ways after a one-day hiatus, led by strong buying action in banks. While the S&P BSE Sensex rallied 990 points to hit the day's high of 74,721.15, the broader Nifty50 climbed by over 230 points to hit 22,655 mark. Finally, the Sensex on Monday settled at 74,671.28, up 941.12 points or 1.28%, while Nifty 50 closed at 22,643.40, gaining 223.45 or 1%. Volatility remained high as India VIX closed at 12.24%, gaining 12% over Friday’s closing.Here are a few factors that led to the surge in Nifty and Sensex:1) Banks and financials shineBanking stocks which corner the highest weight in the 50-stock Nifty were trading with strong momentum. ICICI Bank, SBI, HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank were four of the top five index contributors today.The Nifty Bank index hit a fresh lifetime high today, rising 1,200 points. Barring IDFC First Bank and Bandhan Bank, the remaining 10 counters in Nifty Bank were trading in the green. PSU Bank Index also rose over 2.5% around this time with 11 stocks trading positive with a lone loser in Punjab National Bank (PNB).2) Global markets upbeatThe handover by Wall Street on Friday was positive with all three major headline indices ending strong. Nasdaq Composite finished Friday at 15,927.90, up by 316.14 points or 2.03% while S&P 500 closed at 5,099.96, gaining 51.54 points or 1.02%. Meanwhile, Dow 30 settled at 38,23 9.70, up by 153.86 points or 0.40%.Major Asian indices reciprocated in a similar breath with Japan's Nikkei 225, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and China's Shanghai Composite gaining between 0.81% and 0.65% around this time.3) Crude oil prices fallSlippages in crude oil prices also lend support to the markets. Crude oil prices were down thanks to some letdown in geo-political tensions that created panic after Iran's missile attacks on Israel earlier this month followed by the retaliation by the latter. The US WTI crude oil contracts were trading at $83.030 per BBL, down by $0.820 or 0.980% while the Brent Oil futures were down by over $1 per BBL to $88.490.4) Geopolitics tensions easeIsrael-Hamas peace talks in Cairo eased fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East, boosting demand for risky assets like equities.5) Benign greenbackUS dollar cooled off on Monday ahead of the Fed's two-day monetary policy meeting beginning Tuesday. The event takes centre stage for the week, where expectations are for the central bank to keep rates on hold. The dollar index (DXY) was trading at 105.63, down by 0.31 points or 0.30%.

He mentioned that more investors are joining each day to support the legal battle.

However, these losses did not overshadow the weekly gains, which were fueled by a post-results rally in key index constituents and reduced concerns regarding the Middle East.","Domestic benchmark equity indices experienced a decline on Friday, primarily due to weakness in the financial sector. However, these losses did not overshadow the weekly gains, which were fueled by a post-results rally in key index constituents and reduced concerns regarding the Middle East.The NSE Nifty 50 was down 0.67% to 22,420, on the day, while the S&P BSE Sensex shed 0.82% to 73,730. Both the indexes snapped a five-day winning streak. However, for the week, the Nifty 50 and Sensex gained about 1.25% and 1%, respectively.Here's how analysts read the market pulse: The Nifty witnessed selling pressure throughout the day and closed weak for the day down ~120 points. On the daily charts, we can observe that the Nifty has faced selling pressure from the resistance zone of 22560 – 22625. Until this zone is not taken out decisively, we can expect the consolidation to continue. On the downside, crucial support is now placed at 22240 – 22200 where support parameters in the form of the 40-day moving average and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the rise from 21777 – 22626 is placed,  said Jatin Gedia of Sharekhan.Rupak De of LKP Securities, said,  Nifty remained under selling pressure throughout the session as the index failed to sustain above the crucial level of 22500. On the daily chart, a dark cloud cover pattern is observed, indicating a potential bearish reversal. Immediate support is situated at 22300, below which the Nifty could extend its losses towards 22000. On the other hand, the level of 22500 might act as a technical resistance for the Nifty. That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Monday's action:US Market Close HigherUS stocks closed higher on Friday, buoyed by a rally in megacap growth stocks following robust quarterly results from technology heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft in addition to moderate inflation data.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq registered their biggest weekly percentage gains since early November 2023. Benchmark S&P 500 snapped three weeks of losses, while the Nasdaq ended four straight weeks of declines.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.40%, the S&P 500 gained 1.02% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.03%.European Shares Notch 1.8% Weekly GainThe pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 1.2% higher, notching up a weekly gain of 1.8%, its biggest since late January.The basket of STOXX 600 banks touched a nine-month high, aided by a 6.1% jump in NatWest after the British bank's first-quarter results.Tech View: Dark cloud cover candlestickNifty ended 150 points lower on Friday to form a dark cloud cover candlestick on the daily chart while the weekly one saw a high wave type candle suggesting consolidation in the near term.The short-term trend of Nifty seems to have reversed down after a reasonable rise from the lows. Immediate support is placed at 22300 and the weakness below this support could trigger more declines ahead. Immediate resistance is at 22625 levels, Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said.Stocks showing bullish bias:Momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade on the counters of HUDCO, Westlife Foodworld, Tech Mahindra, DCM Shriram, Lemon Tree Hotels, and Bank of Maharashtra among others.The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.Stocks signaling weakness aheadThe MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of Borosil Renewables, Tata Consumer, Tamilnad Mercantile, Mankind Pharma, CSB Bank, and Bajaj Finance among others.
