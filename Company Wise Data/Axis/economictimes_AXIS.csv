AXIS,2024-05-07T12:26:00+05:30,Bloomberg,Axis Bank brings expats to India in push to woo global firms,"Axis Bank Ltd. aims to boost its global business by hiring Asian expatriates, targeting mid-sized companies from countries like South Korea, Japan, US, Germany, Italy, and France. Facing challenges with South Korean and Japanese firms due to language barriers, the bank has recruited expatriates to facilitate connections and expand its corporate banking division.","Axis Bank Ltd is on a lookout to hire Asian expatriates to help the lender win business from multinational companies. The bank, that recently overtook Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. to become the third largest private lender in India, is targeting mid-sized companies in this area, the fastest growing business in its corporate banking division. It sees this as an “under-served” market by global banks, according to Rajiv Anand, Axis’ deputy managing director.Axis is focused on companies from countries like South Korea, Japan, US, Germany, Italy and France that have good ties with India. Getting the inside track into South Korean and Japanese firms has proven tougher however, due to language and cultural barriers, according to Anand. The bank is seeking to bring on board expatriates who can help make connections with companies and their executives, Anand said. So far, it has hired a Korean expatriate, based in the southern city of Bangalore, and a Japanese, who was relocated to Mumbai.Financial firms in India have been on a hiring spree, though the country doesn’t have the depth of domestic talent that other more established markets do. Headhunters see the likes of investment banks seeking to bring professionals who carved out careers abroad back to India and Bloomberg Intelligence said finance professionals in the country may be in line for a 10% pay rise this year, outstripping rival locations in Asia.Axis is ranked second behind HDFC Bank Ltd. for arranging local currency loans in India so far this year, and fifth place for foreign currency loans, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

AXIS,2024-05-01T15:58:00+05:30,Akash Podishetty,Smallcaps’ resilient show in April has 500 stocks offering double-digit returns. How to navigate May,"The BSE smallcap index rallied nearly 10%, while the midcap index jumped over 7%. Within the smallcap space, over 500 stocks have delivered double-digit returns with the highest gain (Puravankara) going as high as 86%.","Despite an air of concerns around lofty valuations, the broader market found resilience and managed to outperform the benchmark indices in April.The BSE smallcap index, which is a gauge for smallcap stocks’ performance, rallied nearly 10%, while the midcap index jumped over 7%. This compares with a 1% rise in the BSE Sensex.Within the smallcap space, over 500 stocks have delivered double-digit returns with the highest gain (Puravankara) going as high as 86%. It is closely followed by Dolat Algotech, Waree Renewable Technologies and Tejas Networks — whose shares have rallied over 70% in the last one month.Nearly 13 smallcap stocks, including Moschip Technologies, Manorama Industries, Sanmit Infra, Abans Holdings, Yuken India, Indraprastha Medical Corp, Aegis Logistics, Gallantt Ispat, have rallied between 50-70%.In the midcap space, around 52 stocks have offered double-digit returns with Exide Industries being the top gainer at 55%. Voltas, Aditya Birla Capital, IREDA, and Schaeffler India have all risen over 30% gains during the reporting month.From the Sensex pack, banks have dominated the gains with Axis Bank and SBI occupying two spots out of top three. Mahindra and Mahindra was the lead gainer in the benchmark index with a gain of 12%.Sectorally, metals had seen a strong rally during the month by surging over 10%. The public sector enterprise (PSE) stocks have also had a decent run as the index jumped 10.5% in March.What to expect in May?Even though there is stability in largecaps, which are doing well currently, analysts said euphoria is building up in the run-up to the general election as the market is discounting a Modi victory. Post the elections, I do not think the market would have a lot of steam left to rally further because an NDA victory would be one of the greatest news for the market to shoot up significantly. So, one can play tactically right now and be bullish on the market,  said Aditya Arora, Adlytick. I think the market is also pricing in rate cuts, which is a positive which could create a significant short-term, medium-term top for the market,  Arora added.Within the broader market, if investors have to allocate money, Harendra Kumar of Elara Securities is looking to find opportunities in the midcap space. Midcaps more than the smallcaps have a longer runway in a bull market and historically, we have seen they tend to outperform largecaps. So, yes, a large part of your allocation should be in midcaps. And I think what technology and capital is giving the ability for the companies to morph much more faster,  he said.Sectorally, analysts see metals having more steam left in the rally despite a strong outperformance in the last couple of months. Metals are taking a breather now, but I believe there is much more room on the upside in the metal space as well. JSW Steel, Steel Authority of India, Hindalco look attractive,  said Aditya Agarwala of Invest4edu.(With inputs from Ritesh Presswala)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

","Mumbai: India's stock benchmarks jumped over 1% on Monday, led by gains in bank shares after ICICI Bank's better-than-expected fourth-quarter results.

The outcome of the US Federal Reserve's rate-setting meeting on Wednesday is expected to determine the direction of equities in the foreseeable future.The NSE Nifty rose 223.45 points, or 1%, to close at 22,643.4 on Monday.

The Sensex is 453 points, or 0.6%, short of its record of 75,124.Analysts said the Nifty is nearing a crucial level, beyond which it could hit a new record. In the coming sessions, a follow-up move above 22,655 might pull the index towards an all-time high,  said Mehul Kothari, deputy vice president, technical research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.  Technically, the sentiment along with price action and placement of oscillators, all remain in the favour of bulls for the time being. Kothari said the only concern over Monday's rally was that it was stock-centric.Bank shares were among top gainers with Bank Nifty shooting up 2.5%. ICICI Bank and IndusInd Bank gained 4.4% and 4%, respectively, while AU Small Finance Bank soared 7.5%. Banks and financials have the highest weight on the Nifty at 34%.Out of 1,200 points gained in the Nifty Bank index, more than 800 were contributed by ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and State Bank of India (SBI), said Kothari. Out of the 220-point gain in the Nifty, about 150 came from these stocks and Axis Bank, he said. The VIX jumped 12% to 12.24 on Monday, indicating caution among traders. The VIX may have moved up in response to the Fed meeting, which is a major event, along with Bank Nifty expiry on Tuesday, driving up volatility in the market,  said Sneha Poddar, associate vice president, equity research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.While the Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady at the end of the two-day meeting on Wednesday, the central bank's comments on when it plans to start cutting rates will be of greater interest to the market.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//markets/stocks/news/bulls-score-big-on-the-rebound-indices-jump-1/articleshow/109708452.cms

The 30-share BSE Sensex rallied 941.12 points or 1.28 per cent to finish at 74,671.28. During the day, it zoomed 990.99 points or 1.34 per cent to 74,721.15.  The market capitalisation (mcap) of BSE-listed companies reached a record peak of Rs 4,06,52,419.94 crore (USD 4.90 trillion). Investors' wealth climbed by Rs 2,48,043.51 crore on Monday.   Markets witnessed phenomenal buying support as Sensex quickly moved towards the crucial 75K mark after investors cheered strong corporate earnings from select frontline banking and cement companies, indicating their smooth sailing despite the global vagaries.   Optimism prevailed from the start of the trading session as cooling of US bond yields and letdown in the Middle East conflict coupled with a drop in crude oil prices generated a lot of enthusiasm amongst the investors,  Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd, said.  The two-day Fed's monetary policy meeting starting Tuesday will be closely watched by global investors, although markets don't expect any change in the policy outcome, he added.  From the Sensex basket, ICICI Bank climbed nearly 5 per cent after the company on Saturday said its March quarter consolidated net profit grew 18.5 per cent to Rs 11,672 crore, helped by lower provisions.  State Bank of India, IndusInd Bank, UltraTech Cement, Axis Bank, NTPC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bajaj Finance, HDFC Bank and Sun Pharma were the other major gainers.  HCL Technologies tanked nearly 6 per cent after the company reported a flat year-on-year growth in net profit in the March quarter at Rs 3,986 crore.  ITC, Wipro and Bajaj Finserv were the other laggards.  In the broader market, the BSE midcap gauge jumped 0.79 per cent and smallcap index advanced 0.07 per cent.   The Indian benchmark indexes rebounded, aided by an upbeat in US tech quarter earnings and a drop in US 10-year yield. Domestically, the Bank Nifty outperformed, driven by its strong performance in the fourth quarter. An ease in the Middle East tensions, coupled with stable earnings, is expected to maintain positive market sentiment,  Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.  Indian markets opened in the green following positive Asian markets, said Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

Let’s first understand how it is concluded whether a stock has seen a buildup of fresh long position or not. When a stock price moves up and the open interest on the counter follows the same, it is taken as a sign of a long buildup. The signal is considered more reliable if the volume on the counter has also seen an increase.SBI's stock price gained 2.95%, and open interest saw a rise of 0.51%.Zee Entertainment Enterprises price surged 3.05%, and open interest saw an increase of 0.49%.Axis Bank rose 2.59%, and the open interest saw an increase of 1.88%.Cummins India's stock rose 2.56%, and the open interest saw an increase of 1.59%.IndusInd Bank price jumped 2.29%, and open interest saw an increase of 2.14%.Also Read: F&O stocks to buy today: RIL, Axis Bank among top 10 trading ideas for 29 April 2024Some additional checks would help traders make better trading decisions as they increase the probability of a follow-up of the upward movement in the stock price. First, if this fresh long build has come when the stock is very close to its 52-week high, that increases the probability of the stock making an attempt to break its previous 52-week high.Second, if this long buildup is accompanied by any bullish crossover, which means in the current up move when the open interest has moved up, the stock price has been able to cross either its 20, 50 or 100-day moving average. Another couple of points which traders should keep in mind is looking at the matrix of buildup of long positions on the basis of open interest. Also, check whether there is any extraordinary buildup of long positions in any out-of-money call option, especially any far-of-the-money call option. That indicates the probability of any informed person taking exposure through options.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//markets/stocks/news/fo-stocks-sbi-axis-bank-among-5-stocks-with-long-buildup/articleshow/109689553.cms
AXIS,2024-04-28T12:19:00+05:30,Dhiraj Agarwal,2024 promises to be a non-linear market. Here are 3 key reasons why,"Institutional investors grapple with non-linear markets, driven by earnings risk, high dispersion, and volatile interest rate outlook. Sector and stock rotation intensify post hot summer forecast, reflecting increased market participation amid erratic swings.","When facts change, I change my mind. What do you do sir? – Lord Maynard Keynes. But what do you do when information swings like a pendulum that has lost control? Sector and stock rotation is happening at a bizarre pace. For some time, institutional investors tried to ignore hyper-rotational activity as just an irrational retail frenzy that would die down; but they seemed to have thrown in the towel and jumped in. Daily institutional turnover has doubled from INR 25,000-30,000 cr to INR 55,000-60,000 cr since Nov 2023. Keynes would scoff at being quoted while justifying buying power stocks following a hot summer forecast – but that is the nature of the market today. Look beneath the surface and one can see nervousness. This is driven by 2 reasons. One is fear of missing out and underperforming in a hyper-competitive investment management market. Second, lack of conviction in your process and framework. Such violent mood swings typically indicate nervousness and precede a sell-off. Or at the very least, a volatile phase in the market – I prefer to call it ‘non-linear’ markets – with frequent swings between agony and ecstasy. A few such phases were 2007-08, 2017-18 and now. In each of these periods, investors chased, and churned, brokers made money, and Keynes's quote was oft repeated. 2024 promises to be a non-linear market. There are 3 key reasons for this volatility. Earnings risk, high earnings dispersion and violent mood swings on interest rate outlook. Earnings Risk: In the last 3 quarters, Nifty sales growth has been below par at 6% YoY while earnings growth has been strong. Earnings have been driven by margin expansion due to the crash in WPI. WPI-CPI spread, which was 8ppt in May’22 crashed to -7ppt by May’23 and is now recovering. The resultant margin expansion (as input prices crashed more than final product prices) boosted 1HFY24 Nifty earnings by +25% YoY. As margin benefits are fading, earnings growth reduced to 14% YoY in 3QFY24 and is estimated to be in single digits for 4Q. If sales growth does not revive, the estimated 14% earnings growth (Bloomberg consensus) for FY25 will be at risk. Earnings dispersion: Despite estimate-beating GDP growth of 8.4% in the December quarter, why was private consumption growth at 3.4%, a decadal low? Logically, when investments rise, employment, income and hence consumption should also rise. But this trickle-down takes time. For now, more resources are being allocated to ‘I’ (investments) at the expense of ‘C’ (consumption). Neelkanth Mishra of Axis Bank explains lucidly in an article in the Economic Times that Indians are too “invested in investments” for now. This has happened before in the previous investment cycle of 2003-07 as the share of ‘I’ in GDP kept rising, the share of ‘C’ kept falling. So, consumer companies have been reporting much weaker sales growth; and as the margin advantage fades away, earnings growth is also now under pressure. Capex driven companies, on the other hand, are doing better. Stock prices are chasing earnings and there is a huge stock performance dispersion now. Nifty is up 3% year to date, but the top 3 performers are up 30% or higher and are from the oil & gas and infrastructure sectors. Bottom 3 in the Nifty are down 15-25%, of which 2 are consumer names. Five of the bottom 10 names are from the consumer sector. Confusion on interest rate outlook: Hot and cold over the US rate cut outlook resembles the commitment-phobic youth as illustrated in Shahrukh Khan’s 1994 rom-com Kabhi Haan Kabhi Na (literally, Sometimes Yes, Sometimes No). The year started with a consensus of 4 rate cuts in 2024, but after the strong manufacturing ISM data and the estimate-beating US CPI of 3.5%, this view is now down to 2 cuts. A few strategists have swung to the other extreme and now assign a meaningful probability to a 50-100bps rate hike to tame the stubborn inflation. We had mentioned in an earlier article on this page (Why interest rates are the new risk in town) that China +1, climate control, and nationalism are all inflationary. And it will not be so easy to bring inflation down to the 2% target in the US. Markets may have to learn to co-exist with a higher inflation and higher rate environment. But, of course, every ‘haan’ and every ‘naa’ will trigger its own manic-depressive moves.Markets had learned to ignore the short-term information noise and focus on the long term. But this has changed, and ‘news flow’-driven volatility is now common. This is perhaps due to the dominance of retail investors. Retail investors today are the price-setters (average daily traded cash equity turnover is >Rs1tn, 2.5x the pre-COVID average!) and institutions are the price takers. Institutions resisted the temptation to respond to these frequent changes in ‘new’ information for long, only to realize that return retention is becoming difficult as stocks enter prolonged periods of decay. Institutions have joined the churn party. There is nervous excitement on the dance floor. Many do not want to participate but are unable to resist.

The regulator cited “serious deficiencies and non-compliances” and “continued failure on the part of the bank to address these concerns in a comprehensive and timely manner.”","Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank, India’s third-biggest private lender by market value, may see a moderation in deposit growth and a marginal drop in the share of low-cost deposits in FY25 as it shifts focus on fixing its IT systems following regulatory curbs, said banking analysts. The stock was both the biggest loser and most actively traded in the country Thursday.On Wednesday evening, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) barred the Uday Kotak-promoted lender from onboarding new customers through its online and mobile banking channels and directed them to stop issuing new credit cards. The regulator cited “serious deficiencies and non-compliances” and “continued failure on the part of the bank to address these concerns in a comprehensive and timely manner.”“The RBI restrictions will impact the bank’s ability to acquire new savings account customers until the ban is lifted because a significant number of new customer acquisition was done through its digital banking platform- Kotak811,” a banking analyst said.For instance, 72% of the new savings accounts in FY23 — the latest available data — were acquired through Kotak-811. As many as 17.5 million savings account customers were onboarded through the Kotak-811 platform, as of March 2023.  109607520“Secondly, new affluent walk-in customers will want a credit card as part of their onboarding kit, but since the bank is restricted from issuing them until the ban is lifted, it could be a deterrent,” added the analyst.The stock, which lost nearly 11% Thursday, saw active cash trades of about 11,000 crore. Axis Bank, which was the next most traded on the Nifty, didn’t generate half the volumes that Kotak Mahindra did.The ban comes at a time when mobilising deposits, particularly low-cost deposits, has emerged as one of the biggest challenges for most banks.Since the bank’s focus has been onboarding customers through online channels, it has slowed the pace of adding branches. According to a Macquarie report, it has added just 350 branches in four years. HDFC Bank, on the other hand, added 900 branches in just one year.In a letter to employees to address their concerns, the newly appointed MD & CEO Ashok Vaswani reassured that the bank is diligently working toward resolving the issues raised by the regulator. “The exponential growth in business through our digital channels has necessitated a completely different level of technology infrastructure, which we have been steadfastly building,” he stressed in the letter.In a separate FAQ (frequently asked question), KVS Manian, joint managing director of Kotak Mahindra Bank, said services to existing Kotak811 customers will not be impacted.Kotak Mahindra Bank's current and savings account deposits fell to 47.7% in the third quarter ending December 2023 from 53.3% a year ago. A report by Emkay said they are likely to be at 478% for the fourth quarter ending March 2024 and fall further to 47.2% in FY25. The bank is scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter results on May 4. Similarly, the net interest margin stood at 5.22% on December 31, 2023, but it may fall below 5% in FY25, Emkay said.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//markets/stocks/news/kotak-mahindra-bank-to-moderate-growth-following-rbi-restrictions-analysts/articleshow/109600176.cms

As the largest shareholder with a stake of almost 26%, the billionaire founder bore the heaviest brunt from the selldown, the most in four years.","Uday Kotak built his Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. over decades to become Asia’s richest banker. After India’s regulator slapped his bank with a surprise ban, he’s facing one of his biggest tests yet - and a dip in wealth.The lender’s shares tumbled as much as 13% on Thursday after it was barred from adding new customers through its digital channels and from issuing fresh credit cards. As the largest shareholder with a stake of almost 26%, the billionaire founder bore the heaviest brunt from the selldown, the most in four years.That saw his wealth decline by $1.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He was worth $14.4 billion as of April 24.To add salt to the wound, rival Axis Bank Ltd. overtook Kotak’s market capitalization for the first time since Sept. 2016. Axis’ shares had surged after its earnings beat analysts’ estimates.     109593799The Reserve Bank of India cited governance and risk issues about Kotak’s technology systems as reasons behind its ban. It found deficiencies and non-compliance in various processes over two years — from a lack of data security and leak prevention strategies to vendor risk management — according to a statement late Wednesday.Kotak said in response that it has taken measures for “adoption of new technologies to strengthen its IT systems and will continue to work with RBI to swiftly resolve balance issues at the earliest.”It’s not Kotak’s first run-in with the regulator. The billionaire previously took India’s central bank to court over the size of his stake in the lender. Kotak ultimately agreed to reduce his ownership in 2020, ending the feud.New CEOIt was only at the start of this year that Kotak handed the reins over to new Chief Executive Officer Ashok Vaswani. Vaswani has said scale will be critical for the bank’s growth, and that the lender has been investing in technology.Kotak, a native of the western state of Gujarat, set up an investment company in 1985 with a 3 million rupee loan ($41,000) from family and friends and partnered with Mahindra the following year.The financier was Kotak Mahindra Bank’s CEO since its beginning and gained more control of it in 2006 by ending a partnership of more than a decade with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Almost 98% of the transaction volume in Kotak’s savings accounts were by digital or non-branch methods, according to its most recent investor presentation for the quarter ended Dec. 31.“The ban on online customer acquisition will have an impact on Kotak Mahindra Bank’s growth as it is one of the slowest lenders for physical branch expansions,” said Ashutosh Mishra, banking analyst at Ashika. “The RBI ruling will create a negative sentiment on the bank.”",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//markets/stocks/news/asias-richest-banker-uday-kotak-loses-1-3-billion-after-rbis-ban/articleshow/109593878.cms

This reflected a growing trend of using cards for smaller purchases. HDFC Bank led the market share at 20.2%, followed by SBI, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and Kotak Mahindra Bank. ","Online credit card expenditures surpassed the milestone of Rs 1 lakh crore for the first time in March, reaching Rs 1,04,081 crore, TOI said in a report on Thursday.

The top 10 banks issuing cards collectively commanded a 90 per cent market share.The rise in card usage has led to a notable increase in transaction volume. Point-of-sale transactions surged by 28 per cent year-on-year to 18 crore in March 2024, while online payments saw a 33 per cent increase to 16.4 crore. This trend suggests that customers are increasingly using cards for smaller purchases, as transaction volume outpaces growth in transaction value.Bankers suggest that with card transactions now available on the UPI network, there is a likelihood of further reduction in the average transaction value.The popularity of UPI transactions has had a corollary impact, TOI report said. A sharp dip in debit card payments was noticed. Debit card transactions fell 30 per cent in March this year to 11.6 crore in stores and 41 per cent in online transactions to 4.3 crore.

Shares drop 10% post RBI ban. Analysts foresee derating if issues persist, impacting profitability and growth trajectory.","Despite enjoying a higher valuation premium on risk management and overall governance practices, Kotak Mahindra Bank has now lost its status as the fourth largest banking stock on Dalal Street to rival Axis Bank in market value terms.While Axis Bank shares were trading 4% higher on better-than-expected Q4 results, those of Kotak were trading 10% lower following a ban by RBI on digital sourcing of customers and issuance of fresh credit cards.As a result, Kotak's market capitalisation fell to Rs 3.3 lakh crore while that of Axis Bank was higher at Rs 3.4 lakh crore.In Dalal Street's pecking order, HDFC Bank remains India's most-valued bank at about Rs 11.5 lakh crore, followed by ICICI Bank at Rs 7.76 lakh crore and SBI at Rs 7 lakh crore.Kotak and Axis have often been pitched against each other. In terms of market value, both private lenders were at similar levels of Rs 1.5 lakh crore in 2015. Gradually, a sharp rally in Kotak took it far ahead of Axis.However, in the last 3 years, investors have disliked Kotak amid succession-related issues. The two names - Uday Kotak and Kotak Bank - were synonymous with each other for investors. Following the legendary banker's exit last year, the stock lost a large part of its 'promoter premium'.Trouble aggravated further on Wednesday when the RBI prohibited Kotak from onboarding new customers through its online and mobile banking channels and also further barred the lender from issuing fresh credit cards.Also read | Kotak Mahindra Bank shares crash 12% after RBI crackdown. Derating ahead?The stock, once a favourite of long-term investors, has lost around 4% of its value in the last 3 years. On the other hand, Axis shares have rallied 65% during the period.Analysts now fear a potential derating for the stock in the near term if the regulatory issues do not get resolved quickly.Kotak has been reporting stronger growth in retail products, aided by a higher mix of digital sourcing and a thrust on unsecured products. The bank has earlier guided to further increase the mix of unsecured products as the underlying asset quality remains under control, while high cross-selling and reduced costs of digital sourcing are aiding overall profitability.
