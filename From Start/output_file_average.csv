In addition, the conglomerate, which is into oil refining, telecommunications and retail, is also facing unfriendly tax proposals that could hit its businesses.Shares of the company have slid almost 8% since reaching a record high in mid-December. A spokesman for RIL declined to comment. Here are four challenges the company is facing:Aramco deal delay:Mukesh Ambani told shareholders in August that RIL would sell 20% of its oil and petrochemicals unit to Aramco in a deal valuing the business at $75 billion. The sale is crucial to reduce the group’s net debt, which was about $22 billion at the end of March 2019.But in December, the government requested a court to stop the proposed sale to help ensure the Mumbai-based company has enough assets to pay claims in an arbitration case related to profit sharing and royalty payments between Reliance Industries and its partners. RIL says the government’s plea isn’t tenable legally and should be dismissed.RIL expected to complete the Aramco transaction by March 2020 subject to due diligence and regulatory approvals, but said in January that although the talks with Aramco were making “good progress,” a definitive pact is still a few months away. The talks have gathered pace in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.Income tax (I-T) investigation:The tax department has widened a probe to find whether some Ambani family members have evaded tax, according to people familiar with the matter. The conglomerate has denied that they have dodged taxes.The investigation is based on information the government received from French authorities in 2011 about 700 Indians who had accounts at HSBC Holdings Plc’s Swiss branches, the people said, asking not to be named citing rules.While tax probes are common in India and are, in many cases, driven by politics, the country’s richest family becoming the subject of an investigation is unprecedented and has surprised many. Ambani is Asia’s richest person, with a net worth of about $58 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.A spokesperson for the tax department didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.Protective tariff scrapped:Reliance Industries, the country’s largest producer of a chemical used to make polyester yarn, will face more competition in the segment after a proposed cut in import duties for purified terephthalic acid. In her February 1 budget speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government is getting rid of the duty to help ensure the easy availability of the commodity at competitive prices.Tax on investment trusts:The government has also proposed a change to dividend distribution tax, a step that could slow efforts of companies, including Reliance Industries, to raise funds through selling units in investment trusts.The conglomerate has been trying to raise funds and pare debt by selling a stake in trusts that hold its telecom towers and optical-fiber network.The change in rules will curtail returns for investors in the trusts by forcing them to add dividends to their total income and paying tax. The impact of higher tax for unit holders may make equity raising challenging, according to Shubham Jain, a senior vice president at ICRA Ltd, the local unit of Moody’s Investors Service.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mukesh-ambanis-plans-to-make-reliance-industries-debt-free-hit-multiple-snags/articleshow/74278747.cms,1,1.0

And local retailers are at the heart of it as well. The local arm of the Seattle-based e-tailer said it has on-boarded 5,000 offline retailers across categories on its platform under what it calls 'Local Shops'. Started as a pilot six months back, local standalone stores selling grocery, consumer electronics ,apparel and other products are live on Amazon across metro and non-metro markets like Delhi, Mumbai,Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Coimbatore, Surat, Indore and Lucknow. This also includes relatively better known retailers like Sangeetha Electronics, Croma, Vishal Megamart among others.The local stores selling online would also fulfill most of the deliveries on their own as they would be enabled with Amazon's technology to serve local orders first based on pin-codes where they can deliver the same day or next day. If a retailer is willing to sell nationally, they will be able to sell through Amazon’s fulfillment services. Gopal Pillai, head of seller services, Amazon India, said the company would be committing about Rs 10 crore for the Local Shops programme to scale it up further. “This would leverage the best of local stores and Amazon’s network. Local stores are known for fast deliveries within short distances while Amazon’s wide reach would bring more traffic to these retailers, who have good stock availability. A retailer can choose to deliver certain pincodes on its own or by hiring a third-party, and rest can be done through Amazon---in a different part of the same city or other cities,” Pillai said. In light of ongoing lockdown due to the virus outbreak, this could plug the drop in footfall at stores partially, at least, he added. Over the last one month, kiranas and local shops have come to the rescue of Indian consumers as the lockdown crippled the supply chain of essentials across large-scale retail stores while online platforms struggled to fulfill rising demand of essentials. On Wednesday Ambani said nearly 3 crore kiranas in the near future will be able to transact digitally with their consumers in their neighbourhood through JioMart -- the new commerce platform which it has already launched in Mumbai's suburbs like Navi Mumbai and Thane. The orders are expected to be placed through WhatsApp. This is being seen as a potential game-changer for how online-to-offline (O2O) commerce could work. With Amazon’s serious play, going forward, this space would see an intense action.

All of us have remote access and most records are today stored digitally. And therefore, while it is obviously not the same as working in the office, I guess we in the finance world are lucky that we can work from home and can operate with a great deal of efficiency,"" Balakrishnan told PTI in an interview over telephone.Bank of America Merrill Lynch has managed a number of equity and debt market deals in India in the recent past, including SBI Card IPO, HDFC Life block deal, Avenue Supermarts share placements and a US debt placement worth $310 million for Adani Transmission.Globally, it has helped Petronas and Carnival Cruises raise funds, among other big deals.Giving a perspective about the lockdown and its impact on investment banking business globally and in India, Balakrishnan said most of the world is under lockdown right now and China is the only place where people have started coming back to office, but they went into lockdown in January itself and they are getting back after more than three months.""We (in India) have been under lockdown for only one month,"" he said.The veteran investment banker said while markets corrected significantly, most companies across the world went out and drew down their credit lines and improved their liquidity positions.Secondly, as soon as markets started falling, bond markets almost shut down for a while after a very strong bond market activity through January and February, he said.""But, the bond market rallied quickly around the middle of March. Through the second half of March and April, we had a very strong period for global investment grade bonds. Highly rated companies with investment grade ratings, went out and tapped the bond market and raised liquidity. So, after drawing on revolving credit lines, bond market fund raising happened,"" he said.Similarly, deal activity began in the US and spread to Europe and then to other places. Last week, Bank of America helped Petronas -- despite the stress in oil prices -- successfully raise $6 billion from the bond market. This indicates that for a quality issuer, even for a hard hit sector, a large bond offering even now, Balakrishnan said.He further said the leveraged finance market has also begun seeing a revival, while companies have started raising equity and doing other equity-linked transactions.""One major transaction Bank of America did in this space recently is for a US-based cruise company, Carnival Cruises,"" he said.""In India, we have had an excellent run in the last four months. In March, we successfully reopened the Indian equity capital markets by pricing a $300 million block trade in HDFC Life for Standard Life Aberdeen on a sole basis.""Also, we helped SBI Cards raise $1.4 billion via an IPO, which was the largest in the last ten years. In February also, we had helped D-Mart raise over $1 billion through a QIP and an OFS route,"" he said.Balakrishnan said many companies are right now waiting to declare their results and after that they will look to raise funds through equity or bonds and shore up their capital structure. At the same time, M&A dialogues continue as companies evaluate assets and deals which are of strategic importance.""Deals which made strategic sense before COVID-19 will do so even after COVID-19 too,"" he added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/all-locked-down-but-dealmakers-ensure-show-must-go-on-billion-dollar-deals-aplenty-for-right-biz/articleshow/75413360.cms,2,2.0

In contrast, Reliance Trends, which is into more affordable products, can use the Facebook platform to reach out to more consumers.”Questionnaires emailed to Reliance Retail and Facebook did not elicit responses till the time of going to the press.Commenting on the deal, for which Facebook is paying around $5.7 billion for buying 10% in the digital arm of Reliance, a Credit Suisse report on Monday said the partnership could later be extended into other retail categories such as medicine distribution, fashion & lifestyle stores and food delivery, as the Jio investment signals social media giant’s intention of capturing India’s vast ecommerce potential.The investment provides Facebook with a chance to onboard the large small and medium businesses and drive ecommerce via the JioMart venture, the report showed.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/jio-facebook-alliance-may-go-beyond-kirana-stores/articleshow/75419265.cms,0,1.0

Silver Lake is one of the most-respected voices in technology and finance. We are excited to leverage insights from their global technology relationships for the Indian digital society’s transformation.”Silver Lake is a global leader in technology investing, with over $43 billion in combined assets under management and committed capital and a team of approximately 100 investment and operating professionals located around the world. Companies where it has invested previously include Alibaba group, Airbnb, Dell, Didi Chuxing, Hyla Mobile, Ant Financial, Alphabet’s Verily and Twitter.

The Jio Platforms deal, Silver Lake’s biggest investment in India, will help RIL accelerate its debt-reduction plans. The transaction values Jio Platforms at Rs 5.15 lakh crore ($69 billion)—a 12% premium in rupee terms to the enterprise valuation implied by Facebook’s investment in the Indian company. On April 22, Facebook said it will spend Rs 43,574 crore ($5.7 billion) for a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms, which owns India’s largest wireless operator. Both the deals, coming amid the pandemic-induced lockdown, are subject to regulatory approvals. In 2013, Silver Lake made its first investment in India through Bengaluru-based Eka Software Solutions. The fund’s investment in Jio Platforms establishes a new pricing benchmark for the Indian company that will see more external investors in the coming months. In its quarterly earnings commentary on April 30, RIL said that it has received interest from multiple global investors to buy additional stakes in Jio Platforms and that it would announce investments similar to the Facebook transaction. In that context, though the Silver Lake investment is positive, the size is very small compared to the Facebook deal and hence investors would like to see more marquee transactions in Jio Platforms, wrote analysts at JP Morgan in their research report. While RIL has not specified the total quantum of stake it intends to sell in Jio Platforms to outside parties, the share sales form part of chairman Mukesh Ambani’s broader plan to take the unit public in the future. Last October, RIL placed the entire digital and telecom assets in its 100% arm Jio Platforms in order to bring in external investors. Foreign investors now have a holding of 11.14% in Jio Platforms, a startup launched in late 2016 and that has become a force to reckon within the telecommunications industry with 388 million subscribers. The digital services business earned an operating profit of Rs 14,363 crore on an annual revenue of Rs 68,462 crore—up 64% and 41% from fiscal 2019. RIL has launched an aggressive programme to augment its balance sheet, which includes stake sales in its subsidiaries, rights offering and slowing down on fresh investments. The nation’s most valued enterprise, which is shifting its positioning from an energy-driven player to a consumer/technology-focused company, has a debt of Rs 3.36 lakh crore as on March 31, 2020. Ambani had said that he plans to make RIL a net debt-free company by the end of this financial year. Founded in 1999, Silver Lake, which manages assets worth $40 billion, places its bet mainly on technology and tech-enabled opportunities. The fund has investments in Dell Technologies, Twitter, Airbnb and Alibaba, to name a few. Its portfolio of investments collectively generates an annual revenue of over $230 billion and employs 3.7 lakh people worldwide. “Silver Lake has an outstanding record of being a valuable partner for leading technology companies globally. We are excited to leverage insights from their global technology relationships for the Indian digital society’s transformation,” said RIL chairman Ambani. Jio Platforms is Silver Lake’s third deal in the past one month after online travel booking firm Expedia and home-renting company Airbnb. “Jio Platform’s incredibly strong and entrepreneurial management team have brought extraordinary engineering capabilities to bear on bringing the power of low-cost digital services to a mass consumer and small businesses population. The market potential they are addressing is enormous, and we are honoured and pleased to have been invited to partner with Mukesh Ambani and the team at Reliance and Jio,” said Silver Lake Co-CEO Egon Durban.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-fb-us-firm-to-pay-750m-for-1-2-stake-in-jio/articleshow/75544478.cms,0,0.0

The deal may see Reliance, through one of its subsidiaries, pay $130-150 million for the asset, which may also include a fresh infusion to expand the operations, said one of the sources mentioned earlier. “The deal is happening at a slight premium to their last funding round valuation,” said the source. Netmeds, which started operations in 2015, has till date announced three rounds of funding totalling about $100 million. The company was started by Pradeep Dadha, whose family was one of the first distributors for Sun Pharmaceuticals. The distribution business was later acquired by Sun Pharma. Besides Dadha’s family office, the Netmeds backers include healthcare investor OrbiMed, investment bank MAPE Advisory, Sistema Asia Fund and Singapore-based Daun Penh Cambodia Group. “As a policy, we do not comment on media speculation and rumours. Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis,” said a Reliance spokesperson, adding that it will inform exchanges according to Sebi on any developments.  75564361“It would not be productive to comment on media speculations at this stage,” said Dadha in an emailed response, while adding that Netmeds has tied up with Reliance Retail for supplying essentials like groceries to its customers.The conversations between Reliance and Netmeds, which had also held talks with Walmart-owned Flipkart, had been going on before the coronavirus lockdown, sources said. This will be the second major move by Reliance in the pharma sector as last year it acquired 82% in Bengaluru-based C-Square Info Solutions, which makes software for distributors, retailers and sales force in the pharma sector, for a total of Rs 82 crore. Some of the clients of the company include Apollo Pharmacy, Adcock Ingram and other players. The development comes as Reliance is ramping up it’s online-to-offline (O2O) commerce business, first with grocery with the tie-up between Reliance Retail and WhatsApp last month. That deal came after WhatsApp’s parent company Facebook agreed to invest $5.7 billion for a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms, the telecom and digital services business of Reliance. Netmeds generates 90% of its revenue from prescription medicine and over-the-counter drugs. This is similar to other medicine delivery platforms like 1MG, Medlife and Pharmeasy who drive 80-90% of their revenue from selling medicine, focused on chronic customers who make repeat purchases regularly. Last year, Netmeds announced it would add a dozen new warehouses to take the total to 26 as it expanded across India. A RedSeer report in February said it has a base of 6 lakh monthly transacting users. According to the RedSeer report, a market research firm, the e-pharma industry, including consultancy and diagnostics, is about $1.2 billion. This is expected to reach about $16 billion in five years. While over 4 million households were already opting for buying medicine online, this space has become one of the few beneficiaries of the virus outbreak as more consumers are opting to buy medicine online. By the middle of March, e-pharmacy platforms saw a strong spike in sales of masks and sanitisers. 1MG co-founder and CEO Prashant Tandon had said sales of these products were up by 10-20 times before the virus outbreak. “Order volumes are still higher than before Covid-19. But going forward, we are looking at supply issues and manpower crunch to meet the rising demand,” said CEO of another e-pharma platform. Typically, consumers on average transact 1.5-2 times from these companies, while average ticket size of purchase is Rs 1,400-1,700.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-plans-to-buy-e-pharmacy-netmeds/articleshow/75564362.cms,2,2.0

India, which has imposed the world's biggest shutdown to battle the spread of the coronavirus, last month launched the Aarogya Setu (Health Bridge) app -- a Bluetooth and GPS-based application which alerts users who may have come in contact with people who later test positive for COVID-19. The app, which has been downloaded more than 83 million times so far, was initially available to India's roughly 500 million smartphone users on Google's Android and Apple devices, but not to around 400 million users of more basic feature phones. Within a week, a version of the app will be rolled out to more than 100 million users of the $9 JioPhone - a cheap, internet-enabled feature phone that runs on a mobile operating system named KaiOS, a senior government official told Reuters. Launched by Reliance Industries' telecoms unit in 2017, the phone gives users access to 4G mobile data and apps including Facebook Inc's popular WhatsApp messenger.  ""We are pushing it ... the testing is going on,"" said the official who declined to be identified as the plan is not public. India's technology ministry and Reliance Jio did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.  Contact tracing apps such as Aarogya Setu are being used in an attempt to speed up the process of identifying, testing and isolating people exposed to the virus before they spread it to others. While many countries around the world are using similar apps, some such as Australia and Colombia are turning to technology from Apple and Alphabet's Google amid citizens' privacy concerns and glitchy state-backed systems.

The sensex lost 886 points, or 2.8%, before closing at 31,123 points. Selling was led by foreign funds and across the broad, with Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, HDFC and Infosys accounting for most of the loss.The day’s fall more than wiped out the 637 points the sensex had gained on Wednesday on hopes of a stimulus package. Since the immediate spends of the fiscal stimulus package that was announced on Wednesday were relatively small, there were doubts if economic growth will revive soon. This was a concern for the market, HDFC Securities MD & CEO Dhiraj Relli said. 75749535On the other hand, in the US on Wednesday, its central bank’s chief Jerome Powell had said that the Covid-19 pandemic may leave a lasting impact on the global economy. This also spooked investors and US stocks closed lower, which in turn had an impact on Asian markets.As foreign funds led the selling, Thursday’s session here recorded a net outflow of Rs 2,153 crore, while domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 802 crore, according to BSE data. The day’s strong selling also left investors poorer by a little over Rs 2 lakh crore, with the BSE’s m-capitalisation now at Rs 122.6 lakh crore.According to Religare Broking VP (research) Ajit Mishra, the rise on Thursday in the number of Covid-19 infections in India and lack of clarity over the impact of the stimulus package weighed on sentiment. Going forward, “the focus would remain on the FM’s announcements over the next few days”, which will detail the probable beneficiaries of the stimulus package.“Markets will react to those announcements in the following sessions.” In addition, the guidelines for the next phase of lockdown will also be on the mind of market players, Mishra said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-dives-886-points-as-stimulus-disappoints/articleshow/75749538.cms,1,1.0

He said these figures provide confidence that the country is poised for a turnaround.Goyal said the contraction rate is coming down despite the fact that the country was under lockdown during large part of May.Further talking about June exports, he said the situation gets even more exciting as ""our export in the first week of June, is at par with what it was in June 1-7, 2019"".Exports during June 1-7 this year dipped by only about 0.76 per cent to $4.94 billion from $5.03 billion in the same period last year, the minister said.He added that some stress could be there on certain discretionary spending sectors, and segments like textiles may take a little longer to recover.""I hope that by the time we close March 2021, we would have recovered the lost ground of April and May. It will be a loss of close to USD 30 billion in two months....I have the confidence that our exporters and logistics companies together will make that happen,"" he said.Contracting for the second straight month, India's exports shrunk by a record 60.28 per cent in April to $10.36 billion, mainly on account of the coronavirus lockdown.Imports also plunged by 58.65 per cent to $17.12 billion in April, leaving a trade deficit of $6.76 billion as against $15.33 billion in April 2019.The webinar was organised by digital freight forwarding startup Freightwalla.Talking about migrant workers, Goyal said now the industry needs to take proper care of them when they return for work.""...you cannot leave them in the lurch, you cannot let them fend for themselves. I think there will be lot of good coming up out of this lockdown that we faced. The good will be in terms of better future and security for the migrant labour,"" he said.He added that now there will be more concern about their better housing, nutrition and welfare measures.""I do hope all stakeholders going forward will really look at these migrants as important stakeholders of our businesses...

But in the halls of Reliance Industries Ltd, Manoj Modi has quietly become one of the most powerful forces behind the corporate empire of Asia’s richest man.Reserved and mostly invisible to the public, Modi is viewed by many insiders and others in India’s business world as the right hand of billionaire Mukesh Ambani. He played a key role during negotiations for a $5.7 billion deal with Facebook Inc in April, backing Ambani and his children as they hashed out an agreement with the social networking giant, people familiar with the matter said.As Ambani, 63, shifts his sprawling conglomerate’s focus from petrochemicals to internet technologies, Modi is seen as a particularly influential voice. Facebook’s investment in the group’s Jio Platforms was followed by similar deals from a slew of private-equity funds, injecting $13 billion into the business and placing it firmly on Silicon Valley’s radar.The sixty-something, diminutive Modi -- who isn’t related to India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- rarely gives interviews and there’s little in the public realm about his private life. Yet he illustrates how lesser known personalities in India with long-running ties to corporate dynasties can have an outsized impact.“It’s not a company that advertises its organizational structure but the industry knows that Ambani and Modi are a strongly-bonded team -- and together drive deal negotiation and relentless execution to the last level of detail,” said Vani Kola, managing director of venture capital firm, Kalaari Capital Partners, who persuaded Modi to make a rare public appearance at a conference last year, albeit by video.A Reliance spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comments from the company and Modi.Making moneyModi is a director at Reliance Retail Ltd and the group’s telecom carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. At Kola’s conference, he downplayed his skills. “I don’t really negotiate,” Modi said. “I don’t understand strategy,” he went on. “In fact, people internally know that I don’t even have a vision.” He described his role, saying, “I deal with our internal people, coaching them, mentoring them and guiding them on how something can be done.”But then came a hint of his thinking: “Our principle at Reliance is very simple: Unless everyone makes money while working with us, you cannot have a sustainable business.”In interviews, more than half-a-dozen executives in the technology industry, who have had dealings with Reliance, said Modi has a reputation for driving hard bargains. When dealing with startups, he often controls negotiations from behind the scenes by instructing executives how far to push, making an appearance nearing deal fruition, they said.While Reliance’s recent mega investments have drawn the spotlight, the conglomerate also began an acquisition spree to buy smaller firms some years ago to build expertise in newer technologies from artificial intelligence to blockchain. The idea is to create a digital business that wields power in everything from online retail to streamed entertainment and internet payments.Modi has a big say in every deal and often a meeting with him signals the final stamp of approval, four different startup founders said in interviews.“He derives his power in the organization not just because of his loyalty, but because of his very astute, smart and able negotiator skills for Reliance Industries,” GR Gopinath, founder of budget carrier Air Deccan, who had sold a stake in his cargo airline to Reliance in 2010. “Significantly, though without formal education from Ivy League universities, he has a very sharp mind and a rare insight and native genius to grasp modern technology in the Indian context.”Gopinath said Modi is “ruthlessly efficient” and manages to get the best possible deal for Reliance in mergers and acquisitions.Modi is one of the few who have been with the company since the 1980s when Ambani’s late father was building the oil-and-petrochemicals giant. A few years earlier, Manoj Harjivandas Modi and Ambani had studied at what was then called the University Department of Chemical Technology in Mumbai and become fast friends.That’s allowed Modi a chance to work with three generations of the Ambani dynasty: The late patriarch Dhirubhai, then Mukesh and his wife Nita, and now his children Isha and Akash, who are playing more prominent roles on deals like Facebook.Over the years Modi became known as the execution man, overseeing large projects. He broke new ground by managing Reliance’s retail reach to smaller cities and expanded it to India’s largest retailer. But it was with the pathbreaking telecom service that Ambani built up that Modi came into his own.Telecom talksHis negotiating skills were very visible when Reliance Jio raced to launch its wireless services in 2016 and built its fiber optic cable network.One of the people who participated in the negotiations described a scene where select vendors were summoned to the headquarters for talks. The bait dangled in front of each was the massive scale of the project. Unknown to vendors at that time, multiple Reliance teams negotiated simultaneously in separate rooms with Modi as the interface guiding executives, that person said.These days, after crushing its rivals, Jio is the largest telecom operator in India with nearly 400 million users. It’s also increasingly important to global businesses like Facebook and WhatsApp as it serves as an entryway into an exploding digital economy and an e-commerce ecosystem that includes payments, education and health care.“Their work in expanding access to affordable mobile broadband has been phenomenal,” Ajit Mohan, vice president and managing director in India for Facebook, said of Ambani’s company.Among the skills Modi has honed is working with senior executives at Reliance, like Anshuman Thakur, head of strategy at Reliance Jio Infocomm and a long time banker, who plays a key role on deals and regularly briefs the press.Consumer spendingDuring the negotiations for the Facebook deal, Ambani, his children Isha and Akash, and Modi were key right through the discussions, one of the people familiar with the transaction said. Once Ambani gave the go ahead, Thakur worked to structure the deal, one of the people said.In recent weeks, Jio’s investor list has included big private equity names like KKR & Co, Silver Lake Partners, Vista Equity Partners and General Atlantic. Still, the global coronavirus pandemic is poised to put India on track for a sharp economic contraction, which means Modi and Ambani will have their work cut out for them growing digital sales while consumer spending slows.Meanwhile, a crash in oil prices caused uncertainty in negotiations to sell an estimated $15 billion stake in Reliance Industries’ oil and chemicals division to Saudi Arabian Oil Co, or Aramco, as part of its bid to pay down its formidable debt pile, which stood at more than $20 billion as of March last year. Reliance recently said the Aramco talks are progressing.Very little is known about the actual plans of Jio Platforms as the digital business rolls into the next phase of its expansion. Both Modi and his boss may have a joint hand in maintaining this level of secrecy.“Why talk needlessly when you can show your capabilities in the ranbhoomi,” said Kola, the venture capitalist, using the Hindi word for battlefield.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/the-rainmaker-behind-mukesh-ambanis-13-billion-deal-spree/articleshow/76334974.cms,2,2.0

The deal was to be concluded by March 2020 but has been delayed.""Reliance is working to complete the contours of a strategic partnership with Saudi Aramco,"" Ambani said in the firm's latest annual report without giving timelines.The partnership with Aramco would give Jamnagar refineries ""access to a wide portfolio of value-accretive crude grades and enhanced feedstock security for a higher oil-to-chemicals conversion,"" he said.Reliance executed on the next phase of its growth journey in 2019-20, forging transformative partnerships across businesses.""Reliance and Aramco share a common outlook and vision on the evolution of the business in the future with emphasis on higher oil-to-chemicals conversion,"" the firm said in the annual report.Also, the firm said it has formed a 51:49 joint venture with BP plc of the UK for automobile and aviation fuel business in India.With a stake, Aramco would not just have a stake in one of the world's best refineries and the largest integrated petrochemical complex but also access to one of the fastest-growing markets -- a ready-made market for 5 lakh barrels per day of its Arabian crude and offering a potentially bigger downstream role in future.Besides refineries and petrochemical plants, the O2C business also comprises 51 per cent stake in the fuel retailing business. It, however, does not include the upstream oil- and gas-producing assets such as the flagging KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal.RIL's refineries are one of the most complex in the world, allowing it to earn a significant premium to the benchmark Singapore gross refining margin. Its petrochemical complexes rank among the biggest in the world, whose dependency on outside raw materials is minimal. RIL has leadership positions both in the domestic polymer and polyester markets.

The move will further cement RIL’s position as the top brick-and-mortar player across categories like groceries, fashion and general merchandise, said two people briefed on the matter.The deal will involve at least three companies promoted by Biyani—Future Retail, Future Lifestyle Fashions and Future Supply Chain Solutions —going for a merger. The combined business will then be acquired by the Mukesh Ambani-controlled petrochemicals-to-telecom conglomerate.76702335The discussions are now at an advanced stage, and RIL is keen on closing it before the upcoming AGM on July 15. But details are still being ironed out on both sides, and a final deal is still to be signed, the sources said. Discussions for the deal started earlier this year as one of Biyani’s holding units defaulted on a loan repayment.Known as the retail king, Biyani has since then been looking at options, including stake sales in retail units and also putting up for sale the insurance joint venture Future Generali.Several other players like US-based retail giant Amazon had evinced interest in Future Group. But a deal with Reliance offers a much comprehensive solution to Biyani’s debt problems, said a source. “It is likely to be a complex transaction as, first, Future Group will announce a scheme of arrangement to merge into one company. RIL is most likely to completely buy out this combined entity in exchange for its shares,” said one of the sources. Existing investors in various Future Group businesses—Amazon, Blackstone and PremjiInvest—may get shares in RIL. The deal with Reliance is interesting as Jeff Bezos-owned Amazon has had a business partnership with Future Group since 2014. Last year, Amazon also acquired an indirect stake in Future Retail by investing in one of the promoter entities of Biyani.“It’s fair to assume it’s going in Reliance’s direction now. Even though others are still in talks with Future, the strategic direction is clear now, compared to last week when it could have gone either way,” a person aware of the matter said. He added that while Reliance will take over all of the retail businesses, some brands and manufacturing businesses under companies like Future Consumer and Future Market Networks might remain with Biyani. These details are yet to be finalised as talks were under way on Monday.An email sent to Future Group and RIL spokespersons did not elicit any response till the time of going to the press. Two separate sources said Amazon’s rights, when it struck a deal with Future Coupons giving it an almost 4% stake indirectly in Future Retail last year, is “subjective to conditions” and might not be a big hurdle for the deal.“Reliance would have certainly looked at it before proceeding on the deal,” one of the people mentioned earlier said.These people said the implication of this deal with Reliance would have a “significant impact” on the retail sector — both online and offline. Future Retail has over 1,500 retail stores in various formats through brands like Big Bazaar, Nilgiris and Easyday, while Future Lifestyle has 300 stores through brands life Central and Brand Factory.“This would add a new dimension to the much-touted Ambani-Bezos (Amazon CEO) battle,” this person said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-nears-deal-to-acquire-retail-biz-of-future-group/articleshow/76701507.cms,2,2.0

The,"BENGALURU: Top Silicon Valley investor Sequoia has raised $1.35 billion for its new fund focused on investing in startups in India along with Southeast Asia. The move comes as the Covid-19 pandemic speeds up the adoption of digital services across sectors like education, payments and software. The fund raised under Sequoia Capital India will be a record corpus for the region, and takes the firm’s assets under management to over $5.7 billion.The VC firm, which has been an early backer of 11 unicorns — including India’s most valued startups like ed-tech decacorn Byju’s and hospitality player Oyo — has approved over half a dozen deals during the June quarter. It has already started seeing businesses in SaaS (software-as-a-service), education, gaming, digital content and payments beat their projections for the quarter even as those in areas like travel, transportation and retail have been hit.Sequoia Capital India MD Shailendra Singh feels that the pandemic offers startups a time to prioritise on building more profitable businesses than just grab market share. “We want to encourage founders to go for more sustainable growth against this idea to raise and burn capital. We worry that Nasdaq is at an all-time high and technology stocks in the US markets are trading at very high valuations. So will that spill over to private markets and will we see another bull cycle and everyone goes back to burning money?” he told TOI in an exclusive interview.Sequoia has split the corpus into two vehicles — $525 million for early stage, and $825 million for growth stage. The firm had raised a separate $195-million fund last year for seed deals, including its accelerator programme Surge. Up to 20-30% of the funds will be invested in Southeast Asia, where Sequoia has backed the region’s most valued internet companies like ride-hailing and delivery player Gojek and e-commerce platform Tokopedia.The split in the fund comes as the ecosystem has now matured, with more startups reaching valuations of over $5-10 billion. More than 20 portfolio companies of Sequoia have crossed revenues of $100 million, with many reaching that milestone faster than the previous batch of companies. But according to Singh, more measures can be taken to unlock value of Indian startups and investors more exit options.“We are really strongly requesting the government to create the enabling resolution for Indian companies to list on Nasdaq (and other global exchanges), which will be a game changer for the ecosystem. US markets value tech companies differently than Indian markets. It will also create a wave of further FDI into India because investors across the world can invest in the best of the Indian companies and will get to taste success,” he said.Sequoia’s mega fund also comes at a time when the Indian government has put restrictions on investments from China, which has left founders who depended on players like Tencent and Alibaba for money worried. But given the “trillions of dollars with no opportunity cost of capital available in the world” looking for next growth markets, founders building a sustainable business should not be worried, according to Singh, who is also a part of the Forbes Midas Touch list of top global venture investors.“Short term there might be some pain, but long term there is enough capital available — whether it is South Korea, Japan, the US, Europe or sovereign funds from Singapore or the Middle East...Tech is going to generate significantly large companies over the next decade,” he said. He added that India and Southeast Asia should also mirror the US in the long run where Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are the most valued companies.One of the companies looking to become a part of that club is Jio Platforms, the telecom services provider owned by Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries. Over the last few months, Jio has raised $15.5 billion at a valuation of over $65 billion from backers, including US social media giant Facebook, as it looks at a broader digital services play. This would mean it will compete with startups across e-commerce and education-technology.“What Jio has done by bringing low-cost, high-speed internet across the country has helped the whole startup ecosystem. Now their ambitions are becoming more mainstream and conflicting with some of the important startups. In execution-oriented industries, like areas that require big infrastructure build-out, they will be a strong competitor. What we have to see is how well they do in areas where building software and having world-class engineers is the moat,” said Singh.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sequoia-raises-record-1-3-billion-to-back-startups-in-india-southeast-asia/articleshow/76819167.cms,2,2.0

The 2019 AGM highlight was the end of the telecom investment cycle, de-leveraging in 18 months and telecom and retail listing in 5 years.Proceeds from the stake sales in Jio Platforms along with the Rs 53,124 crore raised in a rights issue in June and from the sale of a 49 per cent stake in its fuel retail network to BP last summer for Rs 7,000 crore, will help the company become net debt-free, Reliance announced last month, once the promised funds come in (75 per cent of the funds from the rights issue will come in next year).Goldman Sachs said the focus of the AGM is expected to be largely on product launches around RIL's partnership with Facebook potentially ranging from integration of JioMart with WhatsApp, additional colour on payments business and launch of a large product ecosystem (Super App) where Jio could integrate its services with WhatsApp.""We also expect additional colour on their vision to maximise oil to chemical conversion (to over 70 per cent) to create an annuity-like cash flow, potentially leveraging its proprietary Multi-zone Catalytic Cracking process and through a potential strategic partnership with Saudi Aramco,"" it said.In the past, RIL has talked about 500 million customers being within its reach.

As per TRAI data, Jio had less than a million subscribers for this product as of February 2020.RIL at the last AGM stated that Jio is already a software company, and had invested in 14 startups until then. ""We will look for potential colour on the monetisation of its existing internet platforms (music, video, and news apps), and potential foray into any newer verticals,"" it said.In the 2019 AGM, RIL had outlined its ambition to be in the top 20 global retailers in the next five years. Following the recent launch of JioMart, the management is expected to provide more colour on the path to achieve this ambition.Goldman Sachs said it expects management to provide greater insights into the strategic partnership with Saudi Aramco and how that could into their ambition of an industry-leading oil to the chemical platform with over 70 per cent conversion of oil into petrochemicals.BofA Securities said of the five key initiatives announced in last AGM, RIL completed the strategic stake sale of Jio, petro-retail, and moved to zero net debt.

But the company also faced setbacks due to changes in FDI norms for e-commerce in early 2019, which led to it restructuring operations. It has also seen the exit of group CEO Binny Bansal after allegations of improper conduct, while Kalyan Krishnamurthy runs the e-commerce business and Sameer Nigam runs PhonePe, reporting directly to the Flipkart board.Satish Meena, senior forecast analyst at market research firm Forrester, said the competition among Walmart, Amazon India and Reliance’s Jio Mart will get more aggressive and play out in the next 12-18 months as the pandemic pushes e-commerce growth. In terms of areas where Walmart’s new capital will be allocated, Meena said there are three primary segments — grocery & food retail, digitising small sellers & businesses, and experiments around video & social-commerce.“They are looking at aggressive expansion in grocery, which wasn’t in focus earlier. But that has changed after Covid-19. Their food retail licence was not approved, but they are rectifying it and you can expect significant investment to go there,” he added.Flipkart said that it has surpassed 1.5 billion visits per month and reported 45% growth in monthly active customers and 30% growth in transactions per customer for FY20. It has 150 million products across more than 80 categories. TOI recently reported that both Flipkart and Amazon India have seen their shipments increase to 120-140% of pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels as consumers increasingly prefer online sales rather than venture out to physical stores.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/walmart-to-put-1-2bn-into-flipkart/articleshow/76967652.cms,0,0.6666666666666666

In addition to grocery, Ambani said, the company will expand JioMart to cover electronics, fashion, pharmaceutical and healthcare. The omni-channel venture, that was rolled out during the lockdown in May to sell essential items such as food and grocery, will focus on connecting farmers and delivering their fresh produce directly to homes. Reliance Retail currently sources over 80% of its fresh fruits and vegetables directly from farmers, according to the company. “We are accelerating the rollout of JioMart,” he said. JioMart, in addition to its partnership with Facebook-owned WhatsApp, is working on a hybrid model — a mix of hyperlocal and inventory-led design — that will, for instance, allow consumers to shop from their neighbourhood stores and will also have support from Reliance Retail outlets in the back-end to fulfil orders from consumers and replenish stocks of store owners on its platform when necessary. 76988400“Within a few weeks of launch, we have reached over 2.5 lakh orders a day and the numbers continue to grow each day,” said Ambani. “JioMart is now focused on scaling its geographical reach and delivery capabilities. In the coming years, we will cover many more cities, serve many more customers across India, and expand in many more categories.”Reliance Retail, which has more than two-thirds of its nearly 12,000 stores operating in tier-2, -3 and -4 towns, is India’s largest retail business in terms of revenue. Last year, Reliance Retail’s revenues were Rs 1,62,936 crore and ebitda was Rs 9,654 crore. “In the last five years, our revenues in the retail business have grown eight times and our profits 11 times,” said Ambani.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-retail-to-rope-in-global-partners-in-next-few-qtrs/articleshow/76988401.cms,0,0.4

JioPhone now has more 100 million users, many of whom are internet first-timers.""They (the Chinese players) are likely to cut their price to compete and their margins could shrink,"" said A Gururaj, the former India head of contract manufacturers Wistron and Flextronics. ""I see the Google-Jio phone as a big hit.""Reliance's ambition to hand a smartphone to every Indian could also win subscribers from telecoms rivals Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, who still have hundreds of millions of users with old-style feature phones on basic 2G networks.Realme declined to comment. Reliance, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo did not respond to requests for comment.Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Content is kingThe alliance will see Google invest $4.5 billion in Reliance's digital unit, which houses telecoms and fibre businesses as well as music and movie apps.Jio Platforms has also since April won the backing of global financial and tech investors including Intel and Qualcomm, which could bolster its smartphone ambitions.While Reliance has given no details on the specifications or price of the new smartphone, the timing of its launch, or who might build it, the Jio network's 387 million subscribers and the Google brand name will give it a big leg up.The Reliance-Google phone would likely be optimised for the Jio network and offer users improved performance, said Arvind Vohra, a tech consultant and the former India head of China's Gionee.Just as important are the possibilities for bundling Jio's massive video and music libraries with the phone. Google's Android team also aims to ensure access to apps related to health, communications and jobs, and ease of use for first time smartphone owners, Sameer Samat, vice president for Android and Play at Google, told Reuters.That kind of packaging could help woo roughly 350 million Indians who still use basic, non-touch phones and are yet to taste high-speed mobile data on fancier devices.""This will help users choose a device for its software and bundled content rather than just specs alone,"" said Vohra.The collaboration with Google could also set the stage for further partnerships between smartphone makers and Reliance to make devices specifically for the Jio telecoms network, said analysts.Some Jio customers are already making plans to upgrade to the Reliance-Google smartphone when it hits the market.""I'd like to try the new Reliance smartphone and since I'm already a Jio customer my first preference will be to remain with the network,"" said Rawil Ansari, a construction worker from a village in India's eastern Bihar state, who has been using a JioPhone for the past two years.

RIL's e-commerce venture, JioMart plans to use Facebook's WhatsApp to connect local grocery stores with customers.Goldman Sachs said Bigbasket and Grofers accounted for more than 80 per cent of the market in 2019 in online grocery.Online grocery has been growing at over 50 per cent year-on-year for the last couple of years, but with the outbreak of COVID-19 resulting in shift to online, and the recent entry of RIL, the growth will accelerate to 81 per cent CAGR during 2019-24, it said.""We believe RIL's partnership with Facebook could result in the company becoming a market leader in the online grocery space, with more than 50 per cent share by 2024,"" it said. ""Having said that, we do see grocery as a large category for two or more players to co-exist over time.""Growth in India's e-commerce, the brokerage said, is likely to come from better penetration into categories such as grocery/FMCG, improving payment ecosystem and ease of shopping through WhatsApp etc.""We expect non-grocery e-commerce penetration to see a sharp increase of 500 basis points over the next two years to reach 16.1 per cent by 2021,"" Goldman Sachs said adding the last 500 basis points of the increase took four years.While online penetration in categories such as consumer electronics is fairly high at about 40 per cent as of 2019, there exists significant growth in categories like apparel, appliances, health and personal care, where online penetration in India remains materially lower when compared with peers such as China.""As far as incremental growth in e-commerce is concerned, we expect grocery to be the biggest driver with 40 per cent contribution to incremental e-commerce GMV (gross merchandise volume) between 2019 and 2024,"" it said.Grocery in India is a $380 billion category as of 2019, making up for 60 per cent of the total retail market.""However, online penetration currently stands at less than 0.5 per cent (absolute size $2 billion), one of the least among categories,"" it said projecting the online grocery market in India to grow 20x over the next 5 years, to reach $29 billion in value (5.1 per cent penetration) by 2024.It saw a higher acceptance of online purchases among Indian consumers, especially since COVID-19, as one of the key drivers.Other drivers include RIL's foray into the space leveraging its large offline distribution capabilities and ability to order groceries through WhatsApp - a platform with more than 400 million users in India.""Overall, we forecast online grocery orders to grow from 300,000 per day in 2019, to more than 5 million per day by 2024,"" it said.Goldman Sachs said the coronavirus pandemic has driven an acceleration in the adoption of countless technologies and consumer behaviours, chief among them being e-commerce.""What started at first with panic buying, hoarding and nest feathering out of necessity has turned into an array of adaptations that have driven e-commerce penetration from 16 per cent of retail spending in the US in 1Q19 to over 40 per cent in May driven by year- over-year growth of nearly 70 per cent,"" it said.Globally, e-commerce would grow 24 per cent, it added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/e-commerce-to-grow-27-reliance-to-capture-half-of-online-grocery-sales-goldman/articleshow/77088640.cms,0,0.0

The two have ironed out their differences over certain terms and conditions and a deal will be announced soon, said people familiar with the negotiations. Future’s interests are spread across various entities, including six listed companies. RIL will acquire the retail, supply-chain and related businesses of Future, which will mark the end of founder Kishore Biyani’s play in India’s modern retail, an industry he pioneered. A point under discussion has been Biyani’s role after the deal. One of the people quoted earlier pointed out that companies in which RIL acquires a minority stake, the founder-promoters continue to manage the show, with the energy-to-telecom enterprise occupying board seats, and not otherwise. A second person said that the deal has taken time due to disagreements over the valuation of Future Retail, the flagship of Biyani’s enterprise. Future Retail, meantime, is facing increased liquidity pressure after it missed interest payments on its US dollar-denominated bonds last week. Subsequently, Fitch cut its credit ratings on the company. Promoters own 42% in Future Retail, which runs hypermarket chain Big Bazaar and neighbourhood grocery chain Easyday Club, but 75% of the holding is pledged as on June 30, 2020.  77190095“The board members of Future have finally agreed with the final contours of the deal that was being worked out among the parties. A resolution will be passed over the next few days,” said a person familiar with the development. Biyani is likely to retain the FMCG and residual businesses of Future, the person added. The deal will be financed through a mix of share-swap and cash.Emailed queries sent to RIL and Future didn’t elicit any response till the time of going to press. India’s No. 2 retailer by turnover, Future has been compelled to look for an acquirer after rising debt, falling valuation of its listed entities and a decline earnings due to the pandemic, started to weigh on it. The market value of its listed companies plummeted 74% to Rs 10,464 crore in one year and its debt has exceeded Rs 12,000 crore.The potential deal underlines RIL’s ambitions to dominate the Indian retail sector as it combines the online and offline formats.

If a corporate rival gives documents for filing a PIL, will you do it? Why would that corporate source not come out in the open and pursue the litigation in its own name?

The enterprise value of the retail assets expected to be acquired by RIL stands at around $3 billion, or Rs 22,700 crore, including the debt to be assumed, said sources. The Mukesh Ambani-led RIL is also likely to acquire up to a 10-15% minority stake in the group’s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business Future Consumer, said these sources. “While the deal was expected to close last week, issues over the personal debt at promoter holding companies like Future Corporate Resources have to be resolved as the retail business is the main asset (supporting pledged shares),” said one of the sources briefed on the matter. Nearly the entire 46% stake held by Biyani and his family in Future Lifestyle is pledged, and about 75% of the 42% stake in Future Retail is also encumbered. The multi-tiered transaction will first involve consolidation of the various Future Group assets under multiple entities like Future Retail and Future Lifestyle Fashions, and then a sale to Reliance. Earlier, a stock transaction was being explored, but the deal is now expected to be a cash transaction, said the sources. 77342504Emailed queries to both RIL and Future Group did not elicit a response till the time of going to press.TOI had reported on June 30 that Reliance is nearing a deal to acquire the consolidated retail assets of Future Group.The discussions come as Fitch downgraded Future Retail’s long-term issuer default rating to C after a missed payment of semi-annual interest on bonds last month. Two Future Group units also missed their payments to Franklin Templeton funds, which are winding up. Known as the retail king, Biyani has been looking at options, including stake sales in retail units as well as the insurance joint venture Future Generali. In April, Biyani had got an injunction against UBS and IDBI Trusteeship from selling his pledged shares.According to rating agency ICRA, debt for listed companies of Future Group increased to Rs 12,778 crore as on September 30, 2019 from Rs 10,951 crore as on March 31, 2019.“A deal may close in a week or 10 days if the issues get resolved,” said the second source familiar with the matter. A potential Future-Reliance combine will consolidate Ambani’s presence as India’s largest retailer and comes as Reliance Retail is looking to bring in strategic and financial investors, which the company had announced at its AGM last month. This, after the record $20-billion fund-raise by Reliance’s telecom unit Jio.The move to consolidate physical store operations comes even as Reliance has stepped up focus on its e-commerce initiative JioMart, where it has entered into a commercial agreement with messaging app WhatsApp to reach consumers. Last week, Reliance said that JioMart has reached a peak of 400,000 orders a day already, and claimed it is the largest online grocer in the country.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/biyanis-personal-debt-final-item-in-3bn-ril-future-deal/articleshow/77338405.cms,0,0.0

But a handful of customers keep receiving Venezuelan crude under authorizations granted by Washington to exchange the oil for fuel, so no cash payments go to President Nicolas Maduro’s government.In July, Reliance Industries resumed loading Venezuelan crude under a swap deal permitted by the US Treasury Department after a three-month pause.The authorization allowed Reliance to re-emerge as the largest buyer of Venezuelan crude by taking 216,000 barrels per day (bpd) last month, almost half of total exports, according to the data.The second-largest destination for Venezuela’s oil in August was Cuba with almost 66,000 bpd of crude and refined products, followed by Europe with 65,000 bpd. The South American nation, which boasts some of the largest crude reserves on the planet, shipped a total of 17 cargoes last month, the data showed.Fuel imports by the OPEC-member nation increased in August to 53,160 bpd of mainly diesel and gasoil delivered through swaps, according to the data.PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment.PDVSA has in recent months boosted its ship-to-ship operations near the Amuay bay to load tankers at sea, rather than in Jose, its main terminal for oil exports.

Private equity firm Gaja Capital is in an advanced stage of talks to lead the round at 1MG, while Tata Capital and Europe’s Partners Group are also looking to participate in the deal along with another ‘global private equity major’, said three sources briefed on the matter.The discussions are under way on the final contours of the deal, which may include the total round being completed in tranches, sources aware of the matter said. For Gaja, if the deal with the Gurgaon-based company closes, it will be its first investment from its new fourth fund of around $400 million. 1MG’s existing investors, which include Sequoia Capital and World Bank investment arm IFC, are also expected to participate. “It is looking to raise north of $100 million and the talks have accelerated following the Reliance-Netmeds deal as it would require capital as a standalone player. Around $70 million of new capital has been finalised but 1MG is negotiating for a bigger cheque,” a person aware of the matter said. TOI reported on August 24 how higher stickiness, wider healthcare business has attracted the likes of Reliance and Amazon in the online medicine delivery space. It mentioned PharmEasy is also working with JP Morgan for fund-raise while it is in the middle of acquiring smaller rival Medlife.When contacted, 1MG co-founder and CEO Prashant Tandon, spokesperson for Gaja Capital and Tata Capital declined to comment on the matter. Email sent to Partners Group did not elicit any response.For 1MG’s rivals like Netmeds, now majority owned by Reliance, besides PharmEasy-Medlife, most of their revenue comes from medicine delivery, while they expand to online doctor consultations and lab tests. Tandon recently told TOI that around 50% of its top line is from medicine delivery as it looks to position itself as a broader digital healthcare platform. A report by market research firm Redseer on Sunday said e-pharmacy platforms, including consultation and lab tests, are expected to clock $2 billion in gross sales by March 2021 — with supply chain restoration and rise in new users. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March, 6 million new households tried online medicine taking the total to 9 million households, a recent Ficci-Redseer white paper said.

Leave to appeal is a formal permission granted by a court to a party to appeal a decision to a higher court.He submitted that he had completed his arguments on behalf of CBI on January 15, but thereafter, the matter could not be heard due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Jain along with advocates Amit Mahajan and N K Matta added that as Justice Sethi will demit the office on November 30, the appeal be heard and decided expeditiously as if the part-heard matter, which has consumed a lot of judicial time, will be heard afresh by another bench it will cost too much to the public exchequer.Meanwhile, the court reserved its order on two separate pleas by two firms, which were acquitted in the 2G scam related money laundering case, seeking release of their properties attached by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Advocate Vijay Aggarwal, representing the two firms, said they were ready to execute an indemnity bond of the value of the properties as a surety and if the appeal by ED is allowed against the acquittal, it will deposit the amount with the agency as equivalent to the properties' value.Jain opposed the pleas saying the high court is yet to decide the ‘leave to appeal' applications of the agencies and till the time they are not decided, hearing an interim plea is “abuse of process of law”.He said the court can keep the firms' applications in abeyance till the time it decides the plea for granting leave to appeal and added that the theory of indemnity bond was completely alien to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).A special court had on December 21, 2017 acquitted Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and others in CBI and ED cases related to the scam.It had acquitted 17 others, including DMK supremo M Karunanidhi's wife Dayalu Ammal, Vinod Goenka, Asif Balwa, film producer Karim Morani, P Amirtham and Sharad Kumar, Director of Kalaignar TV in the ED case.On the same day, the trial court had also acquitted former telecom secretary Siddharth Behura, Raja's erstwhile private secretary R K Chandolia, Unitech Ltd MD Sanjay Chandra and three top executives of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (RADAG) -- Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair, in the CBI's 2G case.Swan Telecom promoters Shahid Usman Balwa and Vinod Goenka and directors of Kusegaon Fruits and Vegetables Pvt Ltd Asif Balwa and Rajiv Agarwal were also acquitted in the CBI case.On March 19 2018, the ED had approached the high court challenging the special court's order acquitting all the accused.A day later, the CBI too had challenged in the high court the acquittal of the accused in the case.

Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel and HDFC Bank led the slide, while Kotak Bank, Infosys and TCS cushioned the fall to some extent. On the NSE, the Nifty closed at 11,251, down 254 points or 2.2%.After opening on a flat note, the market witnessed a one-way selloff as European indices opened weak and went into a slide. At one point, the sensex was down 907 points and closed just a tad off the intra-day low. Of the 30 sensex stocks, only three closed with gains.Mid- and small-cap stocks witnessed a stronger selloff with the BSE’s mid-cap index closing 3.4% lower, while the small-cap one closed 3.6% down. The day’s slide also left investors poorer by nearly Rs 4 lakh crore with the BSE’s market valuation now at Rs 153.4 lakh crore. There were reports that, led by HSBC, several global banks had helped launder money across the world. Also, there were indications that the UK could again go for another lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 infections.According to HDFC Securities head (retail research) Deepak Jasani, after the European markets opened, traders were quick to unwind their long positions fearing further weakness. “Asian shares slipped on Monday on fears the global economy may sizzle for a while due to a resurgence of the coronavirus infections in Europe, while fading hopes for US fiscal stimulus also weighed,” Jasani said. European stocks fell the most since July after a report alleged that several global banks had helped launder money across the world, he said.With the Dow Jones index down over 900 points or 3% in early trades on Monday evening in the US, also due to rising virus fears, market players are expecting another weak session on Tuesday on Dalal Street.Technically, too, according to Kotak Securities EVP (equity technical research) Shrikant Chouhan, investors could expect the Indian market to remain under pressure on Tuesday. “On the charts, the Nifty has changed its trading range — 11,300, which was earlier support level for the index, will now act as resistance. The index could fall to 11,000 or 10,900 levels if it breaks 11,150,” he wrote in a note.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-tanks-812-pts-as-virus-spread-stokes-fresh-eco-fears/articleshow/78242748.cms,1,1.0

The US","MUMBAI: After Silver Lake invested in Reliance Retail Ventures (RRVL), fellow private equity fund KKR too has decided to back India’s largest retailer. The US firm will pump in Rs 5,550 crore for a 1.3% stake of RRVL, the holding company of billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s retail business. The transaction has valued RRVL at Rs 4.2 lakh crore, similar to the value assigned by Silver Lake.With the KKR deal, Ambani has sold a stake of just over 3% in RRVL to external investors for Rs 13,050 crore. The retail unit, established by Ambani in 2006, is part of his sprawling energy-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries (RIL). The foreign money will help RIL finance its acquisitions (it has recently announced the purchase of Future Retail for Rs 24,715 crore and is in discussions to buy majority stake in a few online startups). It will also aid the assault on rivals Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart in the world’s second-most populous country where the Covid pandemic has accelerated a shift in consumer behaviour from brick-and-mortar retail to e-commerce. 78289903While Ambani had said that he has received strong interest from investors in the retail business, he had not specified the total quantum of stake he intends to sell in RRVL. He has, however, offered existing financial investors of his digital services and telecom unit Jio Platforms an opportunity to invest in the retail business. Both Silver Lake and KKR had invested in Jio Platforms — the former had put in Rs 10,203 crore (translating into a stake of just over 2% in the company), while KKR had infused Rs 11,367 crore (for a 2.3% stake). More investors are expected to check into RRVL as Ambani increases his focus on the consumer business, which will power the conglomerate’s profits in the coming years. L Catterton, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund and Mubadala — the investors in Jio Platforms — are in discussions to acquire a piece of RRVL, which reported a profit of Rs 5,448 crore on a turnover of Rs 1.6 lakh crore in fiscal 2020. The share-sale in RRVL is part of Ambani’s broader plan of taking the consumer business public.The profile of investors who have invested or speculated to invest in Reliance Retail indicates that they see a lot of synergy between Jio Platforms and the retail business of RIL, said an analyst. Powered by Jio Platforms’ technology, JioMart, Reliance’s online grocery service which was launched in May, aims to digitise mom-and-pop stores, called kiranas, with customers.

This is in line with Mukesh Ambani’s call to make 2G “history” in the country, a statement that would involve upgrading millions of subscribers (mainly from Airtel and Vodafone Idea) to the smartphone eco-system.Speaking at the 43rd AGM of RIL a few months back, Ambani had announced new frontiers of expansion in the digital and telecom space where he spoke of ambitious plans in the lucrative handset market. He said Jio was targeting 500 million mobile customers by 2023, promising to bring out highly-affordable 4G and even 5G devices that would run on Android operating system provided by the new partner, Google.“… there are many feature phone users who are waiting… to upgrade to a conventional smartphone… if only it were somehow more affordable. So, we have decided to address this challenge head-on. We believe we can design entry-level 4G… or even 5G smartphones… for a fraction of its current cost,” he had said, adding that it would be developed in partnership with Google.Reliance sold bundled devices even earlier, but the production of those was outsourced to various contract manufacturers, including Flex.The government’s PLI benefit scheme to boost smartphone manufacturing in India is almost finalised.

The US-based e-commerce major has cited breach of terms due to Future’s sale of its retail assets to Reliance Industries (RIL), two sources aware of the matter said. The move comes after Amazon sent a legal notice to Future Group and a copy of the notice to other relevant authorities like markets regulator Sebi and the stock exchanges, informing them about the matter, which TOI reported in its Thursday edition. SIAC is a not-for-profit organisation offering arbitration services to companies across the globe, which have been enforced in jurisdictions like China, India, the US and the UK. “We have initiated steps to enforce our contractual rights. As the matter is sub judice, we can’t provide details,” a spokesperson of Amazon said, confirming the development. Emails sent to Future Group, SIAC and RIL did not elicit any response.As reported by TOI, the dispute primarily comes from Amazon’s Rs 1,431-crore investment in Future Coupons, which held about 10% stake in the flagship Future Retail, in August last year. As a part of the deal, Biyani had also entered into a restriction on transfer of shares to specified persons and right of first offer of shares (ROFO) to Amazon as well, according to filings made by Future Retail at the time. This list of specified persons included RIL, according to the sources mentioned earlier. The deal gave a right to Amazon to acquire the entire or part of the shares of promoters of Future Retail after 3 years of the deal and before 10 years, in “certain circumstances” and subject to the law.Clearly, Amazon is of the view that Future’s deal in August with RIL’s Reliance Retail violates the e-tailer’s contractual rights and thus it has taken the recent steps against Future Group. This development also comes as Reliance has approached the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for an approval of its Rs 24,713-crore deal to acquire Future Group’s assets.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-future-deal-amazon-seeks-arbitration-in-singapore/articleshow/78562399.cms,1,1.0

Experts have termed the measures modest and have called for fresh steps to revive growth, which is expected to contract nearly 10% in 2020-21 due to the impact of the Covid-19 induced lockdown.Asked about the reforms that the government would like to be remembered for, the FM said reforms in the public sector policy, which provide a greater role to the private sector, mark a “directional shift” from socialist baggage.“To realise the policy that we are working (on) and which is likely to come to the cabinet.

","Labelling India as an extraordinary country growing at an incredible scale, energy supermajor BP Plc on October 26 said it is looking to expand its presence in the nation in fuel retailing and mobility solutions, but wanted natural gas to be included in the GST regime. Speaking at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, BP Group chief executive Bernard Looney said his firm in partnership with Reliance Industries Ltd will in the next 4-5 years set up 5,500 retail sites that will not just sell petrol and diesel but also offer mobility solutions like EV charging facility.  &quot;India is an extraordinary country with an extraordinary history, an extraordinary group of people, and with extraordinary ambition,&quot; he said, adding the country has a growing population, and an ambitious agenda to cut emissions. This, he said, was &quot;very, very compelling&quot;.  &quot;Why is India important, because it is India,&quot; he said, adding energy mix in the country could fall from 50 percent coal to 40 percent, while gas and renewables will grow. Looney said India will be the fastest-growing fuel and lubricant market in the next 20 years and his group's venture with Reliance will grow the network of petrol pumps to 5,500 in the next 4-5 years from the current 1,400.  As many as 80,000 jobs will be created in the building of the network, he said, adding the venture will offer mobility solutions under the Jio-BP brand. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports. These have been taken over by the RIL-BP joint venture and will be grown in the future. While petrol pumps will be expanded to 5,500, aviation refuelling facilities will grow to 45. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports.  RIL holds 51 percent in the new joint venture company, while BP has the remaining 49 percent. BP paid about Rs 7,000 crore to acquire the 49 percent stake. This is the third joint venture between Reliance and BP since 2011.  BP had in 2011 bought a 30 percent stake in 21 oil and gas exploration and production blocks of Reliance for $7.2 billion. At that time, another 50:50 joint venture, India Gas Solutions, was set up for sourcing and marketing gas in India. RIL-BP is investing $5 billion in developing the next set of discoveries in the KG Basin D6 block.  &quot;Our production with Reliance will account for 15 percent of India gas production,&quot; he said. Looney said while the company feels the ease of doing business on the ground, India is a complex market.  GST was a welcome federal initiative to ease trade and it will be good if natural gas is included in that. When Goods and Services Tax (GST), which amalgamated 17 different central and state levies like excise duty and VAT, was implemented in July 2017, five products – petrol, diesel, crude oil, aviation turbine fuel, and natural gas, were kept out of its purview for the time being.  This meant that gas users could not set off tax paid on inputs against those on the final product and tax on tax continued, disincentivising the use of the fuel. He said BP has a &quot;deep, trusting relationship&quot; with Mukesh Ambani, chairman of RIL.  On the impact of COVID-19 on oil demand, he said it was too early to say what the true impact was but there would be some impact in the medium to long term. But communities around the world are demanding more affordable, reliable, and clean energy and BP was committed to providing solutions for the same, he said.  Speaking at the same event, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said India is one of the largest markets in the world for energy, but its per capita consumption is just 30 percent of the world average, offering huge potential. &quot;We want to be an important part of India,&quot; he said, adding the French group is investing in setting up LNG import terminal, city gas expansion, and renewable energy projects in the country.

This is definitely an option on the table (for Future),” one of the people mentioned earlier added. A Future Group spokesperson declined to comment beyond its media statement on Monday. “In any enforcement proceedings, FRL would take appropriate steps to ensure that the proposed transaction will proceed unhindered without any delay,” it said. Reliance, which said in August it is buying Future Group assets for Rs 24,713 crore, had issued a similar comment on Sunday, indicating it wants to go ahead with the formal process of closing the deal, currently pending with regulators like the Competition Commission of India (CCI). As of Monday evening, regulators were yet to be informed officially about the SIAC order on the Reliance-Future deal. The SIAC interim order is valid for 90 days. A final order is expected to come before this deadline expires. “As per the advice received by FRL, all relevant agreements are governed by Indian law and provisions of Indian Arbitration Act for all intents and purposes and this matter raises several fundamental jurisdictional issues which go to the root of the matter. Accordingly, this order will have to be tested under the provisions of Indian Arbitration Act in an appropriate forum,” the company added. Earlier in October, Amazon had approached SIAC over its dispute with Future Coupons, one of the holding companies of Biyani’s Future Group where Amazon had invested Rs 1,431 crore, citing breach of terms due to its sale of retail assets to Reliance Industries. This was preceded with a legal notice from Amazon to Future Group citing breach of terms by the latter.

Future Coupons holds 7.3 per cent equity in BSE-listed Future Retail Ltd -- that operates popular supermarket and hypermarket chains such as Big Bazaar -- through convertible warrants.The e-commerce giant had dragged Future to arbitration at Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) after the indebted Kishore Biyani group firm signed a pact to sell retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance in August this year.Amazon's argument is that Future violated the contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance.On Sunday, Amazon had won an interim award by the Singapore-based single judge arbitration panel, putting the Future-RIL deal on hold.The deal would help Reliance almost double its footprint as India's largest retailer.With the dispute, Amazon is drawing battle lines with Reliance in the race for India's estimated $1 trillion retail market, where online shopping is gaining ground. It needs the Indian partner to strengthen its foothold after becoming the authorised online sales channel for Future Retail's stores that sell everything from groceries to cosmetics and apparel.The tussle between Future and Amazon comes at a time when Reliance has been bolstering its position in the country's retail segment.Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) -- run by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani -- has been on a fund raising spree and since September, it has raised Rs 37,710 crore crore by selling stake in its retail arm.RRVL operates India's largest, fastest-growing and most profitable retail business spanning supermarkets, consumer electronics chain stores, cash and carry wholesale business, fast-fashion outlets and online grocery store JioMart.It operates about 12,000 stores in nearly 7,000 towns, with 640 million footfalls across core categories of grocery, consumer electronics and apparel. Revenues of RRVL stood at Rs 1.63 lakh crore in FY20.The investments equip Reliance Retail with funds to compete in both offline and online formats. The investments come as the country's retail sector prepares for the upcoming festival season and would help Reliance to launch an assault on rivals such as Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/amazon-writes-to-sebi-bourses-on-future-ril-deal/articleshow/78938988.cms,0,0.0

Peak output of around 28 million standard cubic metres per day is expected by FY24 when all three projects are up and running.R-Cluster will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd while Satellites, which are supposed to begin output from the third quarter of 2021 calendar year, would produce a maximum of 7 mmscmd. MJ field will start production in third quarter of 2022 and will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd.Reliance in November last year auctioned the first set of 5 mmscmd of gas from the newer discoveries in the KG-D6 block by asking bidders to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required.Sources said Reliance had in November set a floor or minimum quote of 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price -- which meant that bidders had to quote 8.4 per cent or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.Considering current average Brent price of $40 per barrel, the gas will cost around $3.36 per million British thermal unit.Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.In the first round of auction in November 2019, Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL bought a majority of volumes on offer. The price at that time came to $5.1-5.16 per unit.But international oil rates have slumped as demand evaporated due to outbreak of coronavirus and lockdowns imposed by countries around the globe.Essar Steel had picked up 2.25 mmscmd in the country's first transparent and dynamic forward auction that lasted about five-and-a-half-hours on November 15, 2019, sources said.Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) picked up 1.2 mmscmd while Adani Group and Mahanagar Gas Ltd bought 0.3 mmscmd, sources said, adding GAIL, acting on behalf of fertiliser companies, bought 0.3 mmscmd of gas.Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) had bought 0.35 mmscmd and 0.10 mmscmd went to Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd (GSFC)/Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd (GNFC), sources said.In all, 15 customers across sectors such as steel, petrochemicals, city gas, glass and ceramic got gas in the tender, they added.In the November 15 auction, bidders quoted between 8.5 and 8.6 per cent slope to corner all of the 5 mmscmd supplies available. This translated into a price between $5.1 per mmBtu and $5.16 per mmBtu at the then prevailing Brent oil price of $60 per barrel.Initially, Reliance had set a floor quote of 9 per cent of dated Brent price, which translated into a gas price of $5.4 per mmBtu at $60 oil price. But consumers saw this as a very high price considering that imported LNG in the spot market is available at around $4 per mmBtu rate currently.To pacify the consumers, Reliance lowered the floor/minimum quote to 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price.Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production in September 2008.While the MA field stopped producing last year, the output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February.Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production. Reliance is the operator of the block with 66.6 per cent interest while BP holds the remaining stake.

According to sources, Amazon has also filed a caveat in the Delhi high court in a bid to pre-empt Future’s move to challenge the Singapore arbitration ruling, which granted an interim stay on the Reliance-Future deal last month. In fact, Amazon’s caveat was filed before Future Group approached the high court earlier this week with a caveat against the US-based e-tailer, sources confirmed. A caveat is a notice submitted in anticipation by a person or an entity, informing the court that another person or entity may file a lawsuit or application against them. It says that the court should give the caveator (the person who has filed the caveat) a fair hearing before deciding on the matter brought in front of it. For now, both the parties have submitted caveats and neither of them have filed a case officially. In an exchange filing on Sunday, Future Group had said it was considering all legal options to protect its rights. “Amazon had already filed the caveat to make sure Future does not get an interim ruling from the high court in their favour with regards to the emergency international arbitration award,” a person aware of the matter said. TOI had previously reported that sources close to Amazon believe there are enough provisions to enforce the Singapore interim order in India without getting a similar direction from a court here.When contacted, spokespersons of Amazon India and Future Group declined to comment on the matter.The latest development is only adding to the rift playing out between the Kishore Biyani-led Future Group and Jeff Bezos-led Amazon. While Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries is not party to any of the proceedings yet, it has issued a statement saying it wants to close the Rs 24,713-crore deal to acquire Future Group’s assets “without any delay”.The international arbitration order, which has asked Future Group to hold on to the merger process before proceeding further, is valid for 90 days.

To stress his argument, Raja’s lawyer cited a testimony recorded by original IO of the CBI before thr trial court.Apart from Raja, other acquitted persons, ex telecom secretary and businessman Rajiv Agarwal have also targeted the agency for filing incomplete appeal.The duo had earlier argued that the agency ""has not placed on record the copies of the complete record of the due process to be complied as per CBI manual including report of public prosecutor and Director of Prosecution submitted to the central government for mandatory approval to file appeal against acquittal and not placed any direction of either Solicitor General Tushar Mehta or CBI counsel Sanjiv Bhandari to prefer leave to appeal/appeal.”They have argued that in the absence of such documents, any prior approval granted by the central government would be without application of mind.Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain has maintained for CBI that the trial court verdict acquitting all accused was challenged as an opinion was received that “it is a fit case to prefer an appeal.” The agency had said that the opinion was received from the Ministry of Law and Justice which examined the proposal of the probe agency to file a criminal appeal. The CBI had said that it was apprised through a letter by the Department of Personnel and Training in January 2018 that the law and justice ministry opined that “it is a fit case to prefer an appeal”. HC is conducting day-to-day hearing on CBI’s ‘leave to appeal’ against the acquittal of all the individuals and firms. After finishing submissions in the CBI case, the high court will take up the ED’s money laundering case in which also all the accused were acquitted by the special court. Leave to appeal is a formal permission granted by a court to a party to challenge a decision in a higher court.A special court had on December 21, 2017 acquitted Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and others in the CBI and the ED cases related to the scam. Besides Raja and Kanimozhi, the special court had acquitted Behura; Raja''s erstwhile private secretary R K Chandolia; Unitech Ltd MD Sanjay Chandra and three top executives of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (RADAG) -- Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair, in the 2G case filed by the CBI.

Th,"NEW DELHI: A legal spat between Amazon.com Inc and its Indian partner that started before an arbitrator in Singapore just got fiercer in a court in New Delhi.The US e-commerce giant and Future Group, whose assets billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd recently agreed to buy for $3.4 billion, are locked in a dispute over that deal. Amazon says Future violated a contract with the sale to its rival and wants to halt it, while the indebted Mumbai-based firm says it would collapse if the transaction were to fail.The Jeff Bezos-led e-tailer has accused Future and its founder Kishore Biyani of flouting disclosure rules, according to court filings seen by Bloomberg. Future’s disclosures were “made as per the applicable requirements,” the company said in an email, refuting the allegations. Amazon has also written to the Competition Commission of India asking it not to approve the takeover until arbitration proceedings are complete.While Amazon, Future and Reliance await a verdict, the legal wrangling is threatening to unravel India’s biggest retail acquisition. But why is the world’s largest e-commerce company seeking to derail a deal that’s essentially bailing out a beleaguered retailer, whose market valuation is barely 2% of its own? Here’s what we know so far:1. What led to the feud?Amazon, in early October, accused its partner Future Group of breaching terms of a mutual agreement by announcing an asset sale deal with Reliance, the conglomerate helmed by Asia’s richest man.Amazon had bought 49% in one of Future’s unlisted firms last year, with the right to buy into the listed flagship Future Retail Ltd. after a few years. But the retailer ran into a severe cash crunch when India went into a lockdown in March to curb the coronavirus outbreak.In May, Amazon was considering increasing its stake in Future Retail, people familiar with the matter said at the time. But no such transaction materialized quickly and Future cut a deal with Reliance, infuriating Amazon. The U.S. firm claims that its contract with the unlisted Future unit barred a transaction with a number of persons and companies, including Ambani and Reliance.2. What’s the fight really about?The fight is essentially for the dominance of India’s estimated $1 trillion consumer retail market. Future Group is caught in the middle of this tussle between companies helmed by two of the world’s richest men.Reliance is already the country’s biggest brick-and-mortar retailer. Acquiring Future’s retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units would almost double its footprint and give it unparalleled edge over rivals -- an advantage Amazon is not willing to cede. Blocking Reliance is crucial for Amazon if it wants to hold sway over the only billion-people plus consumer market still open to foreign firms. It has pledged to invest $6.5 billion, a sign of its commitment to the Indian market.3. What did the Singapore arbitration court say?After accusing Future of breaching its contract, Amazon secured emergency relief from an arbitration court in Singapore on Oct. 25 that temporarily restrained Future Group from going ahead with the asset sale.Future and Reliance maintain that the Singapore court’s interim ruling is not binding, but Amazon wrote to local regulators flagging it as a binding order. Reliance has said it intends to buy Future’s assets “without any delay.” Future Group said the matter “will have to be tested” under Indian laws.Future Retail has now petitioned the Delhi High Court urging it to bar Amazon from meddling in its asset sale by writing to local antitrust and market regulators. Amazon’s lawyer told the court that Future’s petition is not legally tenable. Reliance’s retail units are supporting Future and have their lawyers in the court hearings.4. What are the arguments by the two sides?Future’s lawyers said that Future Retail -- the entity selling the assets -- was not part of the contract between Amazon and the unlisted group firm in which the U.S. e-tailer acquired a stake. Amazon’s counsel argued that both the Future firms were controlled by the same owners.Future Group’s lawyers have argued that its existence hinges on the sale to Reliance, and an aborted deal would result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. They are casting Future as an Indian retailer that’s being driven to bankruptcy by a global giant.Amazon has hinted that this spat is about India’s willingness to enforce business contracts. If Future is allowed to renege on a contract, it’ll mean business contracts are not sacrosanct and investments in India are risky -- an inconvenient image as the nation looks to lure foreign investment.5. Who is representing the parties?A battery of India’s highly-paid top legal brains are arguing for the two sides, showing the high stakes involved in the case. More than 50 lawyers represented the companies, Biyani and his family in the Indian court in the first two days of the hearing -- some of them video conferencing from their London homes or farm houses on the outskirts of New Delhi.Some of the legal hot shots include India’s former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, two former solicitor generals Harish Salve and Gopal Subramanium as well as former additional solicitor general and politician, Abhishek Manu Singhvi.6. Who’s hanging by the thread awaiting a verdict?Future Retail and the group at large, since their survival depends on it. The group defaulted on obligations earlier this year. Future Retail has posted massive losses for two straight quarters and its shares have plunged 80% this year. The retailers is reporting its latest quarterly earnings on Friday.The firm will run into financial trouble if the deal fails, its lawyer Salve told the court. Amazon is willing to “sink the ship” but doesn’t want Reliance to acquire Future’s assets, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-amazon-is-feuding-with-a-partner-and-mukesh-ambani/articleshow/79207473.cms,1,0.5

Such never-seen-before volatility came on the back of a series of record-breaking intra-day slides in the market with the highest ever recorded on March 23 when the sensex crashed a little over 4,000 points.The year also witnessed the sensex crashing to a multi-year low at 25,639 points on March 24, but what was remarkable was that it closed at an all-time high with investors’ wealth, measured by BSE’s market capitalisation, also at an all-time peak of Rs 167.2 lakh crore.79223683According to Arun Kejriwal, director, KRIS, an investment advisory firm, the sensex finally settling 11% or about 4,400 points up on the year reflects the remarkable resilience of the Indian market since in mid-year, it had gone down to 25,600 level. “The market’s recovery from the Covid-induced hardships is significant since the macro-economic picture has not improved much,” Kejriwal said.The market has mainly rallied on the back of a global deluge of liquidity with foreign funds net pumping in over Rs 1 lakh crore into the stock market over the year.The quarterly numbers by India Inc have also shown very strong growth, mainly on the back of tough measures to cut costs at all levels, market players said.“This recovery has come on the back of several measures put forward by the government, aimed at kickstarting the economy through a string of incentives, reliefs and stimulus. The impact of all these will not be felt instantly but over the medium and long term,” Kejriwal said.Some of the industries have shown a sharp recovery in the last few months, after the nationwide lockdown was relaxed in June, while some are being helped by the government. For example, there was a revival of the auto sector, mainly two-wheeler and entry-level cars, primarily because of the need for personal safety during the pandemic, analysts said. This buoyancy could continue for 3-4 quarters, they said.On the other hand, the government on Thursday announced a string of measures that could boost the revival of the real estate sector, which is under tremendous pressure in most of the metros. Once construction resumes in earnest, it would generate demand for workers and also give a boost to construction materials, industry players said. In Samvat 2077, market players now expect some measures to boost sectors like tourism, travel, airlines, etc.On an individual corporate level, Samvat 2076 will be remembered as a stand-out year for Reliance Industries and its chairman Mukesh Ambani. During the year, RIL became the first Indian entity to break within the top 50 most valued company in the world while Ambani’s personal networth had placed him among the top five richest globally. It also saw investments by two of the global technology giants, Facebook and Google, along with several other large sovereign funds and private equity majors.The year also saw TCS, the flagship of the Tata Group, become the most valued technology services company in the world, ahead of Accenture and IBM.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/samvat-2076-sensex-up-11-amid-high-volatility-and-a-record-crash/articleshow/79217261.cms,0,0.0

It cut a deal with Reliance Industries to sell assets for Rs 24,713 crore, infuriating Amazon.The US firm claims that its contract with the unlisted Future Copouns Ltd (FCL) barred a transaction with a number of persons and companies, including Ambani and Reliance.The lawyers and analysts said Amazon invested not in FRL but in a company owned and controlled by Kishore Biyani namely Future Coupons Ltd (FCL), which was carrying on the business of wholesale trading of goods and merchandise and marketing and distribution of corporate gifts cards, loyalty cards, and reward cards to corporate customers.But that the August 22, 2019 shareholders' agreement gives FCL critical control rights over the management and affairs of FRL, including a bar on selling any retail asset without its approval and a bar on selling assets to any restricted persons.This, they said, tantamounts to Amazon getting 'control rights' in FRL even though the law does not provide for that.Amazon on the other hand feels it didn't have any operational control over FRL and the agreement only tries to protect its investments. The agreement was disclosed to Sebi as well as the Competition Commission of India (CCI).Sources, however, said the 'control' was in violation of the law as FDI is permitted in multi-brand retail with government approval and with a lot of restrictions such as 50 per cent of the funds being invested in backend infrastructure, mandatory local sourcing of goods and services, a bar on retail trading by means of e-commerce and multi-brand retail being allowed only in certain states.Amazon did not reply to a detailed email sent seeking comments.The charge of foreign control over the multi-brand retailer is being sought to be dismissed by pointing to 12.3 per cent foreign portfolio ownership in FRL.Amazon invested Rs 1,430 crore to acquire 49 per cent equity in FCL. 51 per cent is held by Biyani.FCL, in turn, holds 9.82 per cent voting in FRL.FDI is permitted under automatic route in FCL. The FDI laws allow FCL to hold the shares of FRL only as long as FCL is owned and controlled by Indian residents namely Biyani, the sources said.They said Amazon chose to invest in FCL - a non-multibrand retail business venture, where FDI is allowed under the automatic route.If 'control' is read, as is sought by Amazon now, Amazon's investment would be treated as a violation of FDI policy, they added.Besides, it would have also triggered an obligation on both Amazon and promoters of FRL to make an open offer to all of the FRL public shareholders, they said, adding the approval of 3,00,000 plus FRL public shareholders was not sought for the Amazon deal.Amazon contends that it could have invested up to 9.9 per cent in FRL under the Foreign Portfolio Investment Route and that under the current transaction if conflated, Amazon merely held 4.81 per cent in FRL through FCL (49 per cent of FCL's shareholding in FRL i.e. 9.82 per cent).Amazon further contends that along with the 4.81 per cent it only held 'protective rights' / 'passive rights' in FRL, which do not amount to 'control'.The sources said this is contrary to submissions before the Emergency Arbitrator where Amazon contended that it has ""protective, special and material rights"" with respect to FRL's retail assets through FCL.Amazon says Future violated a contract with the sale to Reliance, while the indebted Mumbai-based firm says it would collapse if the transaction were to fail.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/amazon-seeking-to-exercise-control-over-future-retail-without-owning-a-stake/articleshow/79289645.cms,1,1.0

Its business includes supermarkets, consumer electronics chain stores, cash and carry wholesale business, fast-fashion outlets, and online grocery store JioMart.The investments equip Reliance Retail with funds to compete in both offline and online formats as well as giving ammunition for battle against rivals such as Walmart-owned e-commerce company Flipkart and Amazon.The new funding came weeks after Reliance acquired the retail, wholesale, logistics and warehouse business of Future Group for an enterprise value of Rs 24,173 crore to consolidate its dominant market positioning in offline retail.The deal however is being challenged by US e-commerce giant Amazon, which had taken a stake in Future's unlisted entity.Earlier, Reliance raised an unprecedented Rs 1.52 lakh crore for Jio Platforms, the group's telecom and digital services company, from investors such as Facebook, Intel and Google.The oil-telecom-to-retail conglomerate intends to divest minority stakes in its digital and retail businesses, and hold initial public offering for each within five years.Reliance Retail in May this year launched JioMart, an e-commerce venture, to connect mom-and-pop stores, called Kirana, with consumers.Isha Mukesh Ambani, director of RRVL, said the company looks forward to working with its partners after the ""phenomenal interest"" shown by them.""With our focus on new commerce, we are committed to playing a transformational role in the Indian retail sector by empowering millions of merchants and micro, small and medium enterprises,"" she said.Isha is the daughter of the richest Indian, Mukesh Ambani.

Reliance Retail also said its success in bringing such a huge repertoire of traditional handcrafted products to its modern retail formats is also an indication of the existence of demand for such products, as long as consumers’ expectations of quality, style, and convenience of modern retail buying can be met.  The fashion and lifestyle arm of Reliance said its 'Indie range' (Indie by AJIO) is sourced from over 50 GI crafts clusters from across Indian states - including Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.  With this geographical indication tag, natural produce, handicrafts, or manufactured goods are identified native to a territory, region, or locality for their unique characteristics.  &quot;The diversity of sourcing from across the length and breadth of India has resulted not only in the creation of a stunning portfolio that is every handcraft connoisseur’s dream, but also in the direct employment for over 30,000 skilled artisans across the country. We will continue to grow this segment with time,&quot; Akhilesh Prasad said.  Reliance Retail's other brand 'Swadesh' has an MoU with the Ministry of Textiles which enables the sourcing of 100 percent authentically crafted products, directly from artisan communities. This brand is available across multiple formats including AJIO and Trends, while it also offers over 400 types of handmade textiles, handicrafts, and agricultural products that are listed with GI tags.

It could be quite possible that Jio launches its own affordable 5G handset to boost penetration. At the 43rd Annual General Meeting in July 2020, Reliance Jio had announced a partnership with Google to introduce an Android-based operating system for affordable smartphones.

Located at a water depth of more than 2,000 metres, R Cluster is also the deepest offshore gas field in Asia and the first ultra-deepwater project to come on stream in India, the companies said in a joint statement.The D1 and D3 fields in the KG-D6 block, touted as the world’s biggest gas find of the time, ceased production in February after being in operation for a decade during which it pumped about 3 trillion cubic feet of gas – way below the initial projection.The start of production from R Cluster will boost the government’s efforts to expand the share of natural gas in the country’s energy basket from 6% to 15% in the next three years as part of plans to reduce the economy’s carbon footprint. But it also coincides with record low gas prices in India because of the government’s pricing formula benchmarked to surplus markets.The formula allows a price ceiling of $4.06 per unit for gas produced from ultra-deepwater fields such as R Cluster against $1.79 for supplies from non-challenging fields.Production from R Cluster is expected to reach a plateau of about 12.9 mmscmd (million standard cubic meters per day) in 2021. Satellites Cluster will be the next project that will be brought on stream in 2021 followed by the MJ project in 2022.The three projects together are expected to meet about 15% of India’s gas demand by 2023 and will utilise the existing infrastructure in KG D6 block, the companies said in a joint statement.Peak gas production from the three fields is expected to be around 30 mmscmd by 2023 which is expected to be about 25% of India’s domestic production and will help reduce the country’s dependence on imported gas.Reliance is the operator of KG-D6 block with 66.67% interest, while BP holds 33.33%. ""This is a significant milestone in India's energy landscape, for a cleaner and greener gas-based economy. Through our deep-water infrastructure in the Krishna Godavari basin we expect to produce gas and meet the growing clean energy requirements of the nation,” the statement quoted Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani as saying.“This start-up is another example of the possibility of our partnership with Reliance, bringing the best of both companies to help meet India’s rapidly expanding energy needs. Growing India’s own production of cleaner-burning gas to meet a significant portion of its energy demand, these three new KG D6 projects will support the country’s drive to shape and improve its future energy mix” it quoted BP CEO Bernard Looney as saying.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-returns-to-gas-market-after-a-decade-with-another-kg-block-field/articleshow/79801825.cms,0,0.75

The BSE, NSE and CCI have already approved the transaction,” he added. When contacted by TOI, a spokesperson for Amazon India said the US-headquartered e-tailer is studying the order.

However for the reasons stated earlier, a stay can’t be granted at this stage, it said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hc-wont-block-amazon-from-writing-to-regulators/articleshow/79848778.cms,2,2.0

But, 2020 has been a year full of events outside the realm of imagination.The year started off on an ominous note for financial markets when on January 3 top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike in Iraq, ratcheting up tensions in the Middle East.The sensex tumbled more than 900 points over two sessions but resumed its upward march to hit life highs later that month.Equities largely shrugged off initial reports of a coronavirus outbreak in China, in tandem with the global bourses, and looked ahead to the Budget.However, the Sensex logged one of its biggest single-day declines on February 1 after the Union Budget failed to live up to market expectations of growth-boosting measures and fiscal discipline.The real test, alas, was ahead.From mid-February, world stocks started getting skittish as it became clear that the Covid-19 crisis would not be limited to China.To add to the woes, Yes Bank was placed under a moratorium in a rare move, triggering a crisis of confidence in the domestic banking sector.The explosive cocktail of a global market meltdown and domestic troubles proved too much to take for Dalal Street. Four of the biggest single-day declines in the history of BSE sensex came in March 2020, leaving participants shell-shocked.Its biggest-ever plunge (in absolute terms) was on March 23, when the benchmark crashed 3,934.72 points or 13.15 per cent.Astonishingly, March also saw some of the index's biggest up-moves amid the RBI stepping in with emergency liquidity support.The Sensex's largest-ever single-session gain came a little later on April 7, when it zoomed 2,476.26 points as investors wagered on more stimulus measures from the government to battle the economic fallout of the pandemic.The turbulence on the domestic bourses also mirrored global market turmoil. The Dow Jones suffered its worst fall, emerging market assets were routed and in a mind-boggling moment, US oil futures turned negative for the first time in history.For a while, the world stopped making any sense.With the world economy comatose and governments overwhelmed by a cataclysmic health crisis, the task of propping up the financial markets and restoring investor confidence fell to the global central banks.""2020 will probably go down in history as a year when global central bankers injected close to $11 trillion as stimuli to combat the COVID pandemic,” said S Ranganathan, head of research at LKP Securities.The massive money printing by the US Federal Reserve and its peers sparked a breathtaking turnaround in global stock markets.Never bet against the Fed, as the saying goes.Flush with funds, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) poured in billions of dollars into emerging markets, with India topping the chart in Asia.FPI net inflows into Indian equity markets have crossed Rs 1.5 lakh crore (over $20 billion) this year -- a lifetime peak.The sensex erased its 2020 losses on November 5, while global investors monitored the results of the tightly-contested US elections.The next booster dose for world markets came over the following few days as companies like Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca began announcing positive results from their Covid-19 vaccine trials.Human innovation once again triumphed against all odds, setting off a record-shattering relief rally in equities. From November 9 to December 18, the sensex hit fresh record highs in 22 out of the 29 sessions.For the calendar year (till December 24), the sensex has gained 13.86 per cent, while the Nifty has delivered returns of 12.99 per cent.Compared to the March lows, both the indices are up by a hefty 80 per cent.Benchmarks had another engine propelling them higher this year – Reliance Industries (RIL), which became the first Indian company to reach a market capitalisation of Rs 15 lakh crore ($200 billion) in September.Beginning April, the Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate announced a slew of deals to sell minority stakes in its telecom and retail arms to marquee investors like Facebook, Google, Silver Lake, KKR, Mubadala, and Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia.The company has raised around $25 billion so far this year as it seeks to ramp up its consumer-facing businesses.For a good part of the year, RIL almost single-handedly drove the domestic benchmarks higher in the absence of any buying triggers.The Covid-19 crisis also forced investors to take a relook at their sectoral allocations.""From the lows, markets started stabilising and pandemic sectors like FMCG, IT, pharma and chemicals benefitted. As the economy further opened up, growth and cyclical sectors reversed positively,"" said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.However, while stocks seem to have found their animal spirits back, there are also some murmurs of discontent.Analysts say world stock markets have developed a dangerous addiction to endless money printing by central banks, and show withdrawal symptoms of a junkie at the slightest indication of a moderation in monetary stimulus.Back home too, around half of the government's Rs 20.97 lakh crore economic stimulus package comprised RBI's liquidity measures.This glut of global liquidity has pushed markets so far ahead of economic fundamentals that some are beginning to question whether the real economy matters in equity investing at all.For example, no one would be able to tell looking at the sensex chart that the Indian economy shrank 23.9 per cent in the first three months of FY21, and 7.5 per cent the next quarter.Globally too, markets have been on a manic upswing even as millions have lost their jobs, small businesses are battling for survival and entire industries have been decimated.While the real economy has been ravaged by the pandemic, most financial market indicators are ruling at stratospheric levels.The BSE Sensex is currently trading at a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 32.89, the highest on record.To put it differently, investors are paying Rs 32.89 for every rupee of future earnings of the 30 Sensex firms, compared to the previous 20-year average of around Rs 19.Global market capitalisation -- the value of all the listed stocks in the world – topped $100 trillion for the first time ever in December.And in a classic sign of market mania, there's a rush of first-time investors eager to make a quick buck.A record 68 lakh new dematerialised (or demat) accounts were opened in India between April and October 2020, compared to nearly 49 lakh in the entire FY20, which was the highest in a decade.Experts attribute this trend to factors like increased time at home due to the lockdown, efforts to make up for lost jobs or incomes, and also FOMO, or the fear of missing out on this rally.This is also reflected in the growing popularity of discount broking apps like Zerodha and Upstox, which have dislodged traditional broking houses in terms of active clients.Like the Robinhood app in the US, such platforms have attracted the tech-savvy crowd with their slick interface and mobile-first approach which has 'gamified' the once-stodgy field of stock market investing.With Fed and FOMO playing in tandem, many questioned technicalities like PE and PB ratios. But, some analysts also maintain that 2020 was an outlier in terms of corporate earnings and hence valuation metrics like PE ratios this year are not strictly comparable to historical averages.However, even they agree that every segment of the economy would have to stage a synchronous and sensational comeback to catch up with the market projections.And if that comes to pass, 2021 would be an even more incredible year for the bourses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/virus-vaccines-and-volatility-stock-market-takes-a-wild-ride-in-2020/articleshow/79986727.cms,1,1.0

As a consequence of illegal actions of vested interests and miscreants, the petitioner's infrastructure across Punjab has been severely damaged, causing losses to the tune of hundreds of crore.The company also sought constitution of a competent authority under the Punjab Prevention of Damage to Public and Private Property Act for the assessment of losses caused to it.It has stated that it had given a representation to the Punjab chief minister last month, seeking urgent intervention in the matter.In the petition, the company submitted that the petitioner, its parent company and its affiliates had no plans to enter corporate or contract farming.In a statement, Reliance said it ""has nothing whatsoever to do with the three farm laws currently debated in the country, and in no way benefits from them”.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-jio-moves-hc-against-damage-to-infra-forcible-closure-of-stores/articleshow/80097407.cms,1,0.8

Facebook invested $5.7 billion for a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms last year.JioMart was launched in May last year with plans to be operational across 200 cities in India.

In the process, the index also recouped most of the over 1,200-point loss that it had witnessed since touching an all-time intraday high at 49,795 points on January 13. The day’s gains added about Rs 3.5 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 195.9 lakh crore.On the NSE, the Nifty closed 240 points, also 1.7%, higher at 14,521. According to LKP Securities head (research) S Ranganathan, the markets began on a positive note on support from global cues with Janet Yellen, the incoming US treasury secretary, calling for a much larger stimulus to bolster that country’s response to the pandemic. The gains in the afternoon trade were supported by hopes of positive foreign flows next month due to change in MSCI indices.“FPI (foreign portfolio investor) inflows of Rs 17,500 crore this month and hopes of strategic divestment have pushed bears on the back foot,” Ranganathan wrote in a note. A section of market players here are also concerned about the implications of Yellen’s statement on Tuesday that the US tax cut of 2017, which favoured the wealthy, should be reversed. Tuesday’s strong gains, however, came despite muted foreign fund net buying, while domestic funds were net sellers. End-of-the-day data on the BSE showed that while FPIs were net buyers at Rs 258 crore, domestic institutions were net sellers at Rs 199 crore. Additionally, the gains came despite the rising number of infections in several parts of Europe and concerns about the economic condition in those regions.Dealers feel muted foreign fund flows may not be good news for the Indian market, more so after the over $23-billion net inflows that the Indian market witnessed between October and December last year. Compared to an average daily net inflow of about Rs 2,800 crore during November and December, in January it has come down to about Rs 1,250 crore, according to CDSL data.In Tuesday’s session, HDFC, Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank contributed the most to the sensex’s gains. Of the 30 index constituents, only three — ITC, Tech Mahindra and M&M — closed in the red.

The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in October granted an interim relief to Amazon by asking Future to put on hold its merger with Reliance.Amazon's petition in the court, reviewed by TOI, said Biyani-led Future Group 'deliberately and maliciously' disobeyed the international arbitration ruling from SIAC. The filing showed it also sought detention of Biyani in a ‘civil prison’ and attaching his assets to the case. In its bid to block the completion of Reliance-Future deal, the petition has sought an injunction from the court to direct Future Group from taking any steps to complete the disputed transaction with any entities that are part of the Reliance Group. This includes any 'direct or indirect transfer’ of Future Group assets to Reliance, according to Amazon’s plea to the court. Future Retail, in a filing to the BSE on Monday evening, said Amazon’s lawyers have informed the company of the case and it will defend the case. An Amazon India spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.Amazon’s latest move underscores the importance of the Indian market where it is fighting a bigger battle with Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, who is scaling up the new commerce venture with JioMart. The global e-commerce major has also sought directions from the court to restrict Future Group from relying on any regulatory or local agency approval to go ahead with the merger. Last week, market regulator Sebi gave a conditional nod to the Reliance-Future deal while antitrust regulator Competition Commission of India (CCI) gave its approval in November. Prior to this, Future in its case against Amazon had asked the court to restrict the latter from ‘interfering’ in the deal completion process by writing to the regulators. The court did not grant this to Future among its other observations. Separately, Amazon has filed an application to review this ruling from the court as well.

Previously, Future too had approached the HC to stop Amazon from writing to regulators citing the SIAC order, but the court did not grant the injunction and said Amazon was free to write to regulators.“We have utmost respect for the Indian legal system and appreciate the interim order of the honourable Delhi high court to uphold the enforceability of the EA’s order and maintain status quo,” a spokesperson of Amazon India said. A Future Group spokesperson said the company is legally advised that the basis of the interim award of the emergency arbitrator has been superseded by the judgement dated December 21, 2020, passed by Justice Mukta Gupta of Delhi high court. ""The company will explore all legal remedies and take appropriate steps to pursue the scheme of arrangement,"" the spokesperson added.

This will make the oil 'carbon-neutral'.The Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) Sea Pearl containing the carbon-neutral oil unloaded the cargo at Jamnagar on January 28.""This transaction is a first step in the creation of a new market for climate-differentiated crude oil,"" the statement said.It is also a bridge to the development of a further differentiated petroleum product, net-zero oil, which Occidental intends to eventually produce through the capture and sequestration of atmospheric CO2 via industrial-scale direct air capture (DAC) facilities and geological sequestration.Ambani had in July last year unveiled plans to turn Reliance into a net carbon zero company by 2035. This will be done by embracing new technologies to convert its carbon dioxide emissions into useful products and chemicals.OLCV said the oil was produced in the US Permian Basin by Occidental and delivered to Reliance in India.""Macquarie arranged and structured the bundled offset supply and retirement,"" it said.The offsets were sourced from a variety of projects verified under the Verra Verified Carbon Standard meeting eligibility criteria for the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).""The volume of offsets applied against the cargo are sufficient to cover the expected GHG emissions from the entire crude lifecycle including oil extraction, transport, storage, shipping, refining, subsequent use, and combustion,"" it said.This type of transaction, which involves the bundling of high-quality carbon offsets with crude oil, is an immediate executable solution that helps promote investments in longer-term, industrial-scale decarbonisation strategies.It is also a step in the furtherance of Occidental's net-zero ambitions and commitment to addressing climate change today.Occidental, the first US-based international energy company to announce an ambition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions associated with the use of its products by 2050, has been using carbon-dioxide in its enhanced oil recovery operations in the Permian for over 40 years.""We are taking important initial steps to work with our customers in hard-to-decarbonize industries to offer carbon-neutral and other low-carbon products that will leverage our expertise in carbon management to lower their total carbon impact and address Scope 3 emissions,"" said Richard Jackson, president of OLCV.

With a net worth of about $80 billion, Ambani is again richer than Zhong Shanshan, whose bottled-water company tanked a record 20% this week.The Chinese tycoon is worth $76.6 billion, down more than $22 billion from a peak just last week, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. 81228674Ambani spent most of the past two years leading the ranking of Asia’s richest people, taking over from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s Jack Ma. Then the listing of two companies put Zhong on the map: He grabbed the title from Ambani at the end of December and by early 2021 was the sixth-wealthiest person on Earth, surpassing Warren Buffett.Zhong’s Nongfu Spring Co more than tripled from its initial public offering to a peak in January as investors flocked to consumer shares, while his vaccine maker, Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co, surged as much as 3,757%.But the rally faded as the Hong Kong and Chinese stock markets were among the world’s biggest decliners this week. Nongfu shares have erased their gains for the year, while Wantai’s posted a record monthly plunge.Ambani has focused on pivoting his empire to tech and e-commerce, moving away from energy. Last year, he sold stakes in Reliance’s digital and retail units worth $27 billion to investors including Google and Facebook Inc, lifting his fortune by $18 billion.The spinoff announced this week of the oil-to-chemicals unit -- which accounted for more than 60% of the conglomerate’s revenue in the last fiscal year -- will help the tycoon bring in more investors and expedite a proposed stake sale to Saudi Arabian Oil Co.Zhong and Ambani are not the only two swapping titles lately. Tesla Inc’s Elon Musk became the world’s richest person at the start of January before Amazon.com Inc's Jeff Bezos regained the No. 1 spot earlier this month as shares of the electronic-car maker tanked.Musk lost $15 billion on Monday alone after he tweeted that the prices of cryptocurrencies seemed high -- just two weeks after Tesla said it invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. 81165616",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mukesh-ambani-is-again-richest-asian-as-chinas-zhong-loses-22-billion/articleshow/81231712.cms,1,1.0

This is a 37% rise in the number of global first-time investors who invested in Indian startups, given that the corresponding number stood at 43 in 2019. 81523755Not only did Indian startups attract more foreign investors, they also saw larger bets and raised greater capital for the ecosystem in 2020. The top 10 new global investors in 2020 participated in around $7 billion worth of deals, while this was only $1.2 billion in 2019, data showed. This includes co-investment by other players in the same deals.There were sovereign funds like Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which pooled almost $4 billion into RIL’s fund-raising for its group companies. Other instances of global firms tapping India included Luxor Capital Group’s investment in Zomato, Alkeon Capital’s backing of Byju’s, and South Korea’s NXC Corporation investing in DMI Finance.International investment came in from over 15 countries. Of these, 60% investors had their headquarters in the US, followed by 7% who had their headquarters in Japan and South Korea each. The Middle East region was another major investor base. The investment deals by such first-time international backers were highest in consumer apps and platforms (14 deals) followed by Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) & Artificial Intelligence (AI) at 11 deals.Praxis Global Alliance managing partner and CEO Madhur Singhal said Indian internet companies are scaling up rapidly, prompting global investors to participate in the ecosystem’s growth. “Also, many experienced India fund managers at global investment firms who understand the nuances of the startups here have turned entrepreneurs and set up their own funds,” he added.As of December 2020, India was home to 37 unicorns with 14 companies making it to the elite list in the pandemic year alone.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/startups-see-37-more-first-time-global-backers/articleshow/81518489.cms,2,2.0

Biyani, along with others, has been asked to appear in court on April 28.The high court also asked them to show cause as to why they be not detained for 3 months under civil prison for violating emergency arbitrator's order.The high court's order came on Amazon's plea seeking direction to order enforcement of the award by Singapore's EA on October 25, 2020, restraining FRL from going ahead with its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail.The decision is a setback for Future, the country's second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores, which agreed to sell its retail businesses to market leader Reliance last year.However, e-commerce giant Amazon, which had its sights set on ultimately owning part of the retail assets itself, argued a 2019 deal it had with a unit of Future contained clauses prohibiting Future Retail from selling them to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list including Reliance.Amazon had moved the Delhi HC in January to enforce the emergency award (EA) by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), which had asked Future Group not to proceed with the RIL deal till it pronounces a final order. Previously, Future too had approached the HC to stop Amazon from writing to regulators citing the SIAC order, but the court did not grant the injunction and said Amazon was free to write to regulators.(With inputs from agencies)",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/delhi-hc-restrains-future-retail-reliance-deal-on-amazons-plea/articleshow/81570982.cms,1,1.0

By 2024, the market is expected to grow to $1.3 trillion.India - population 1.3 billion - has over the years become a sought-after retail destination with a growing base of young and affluent shoppers. The sector contributes 10% to India's gross domestic product and accounts for 8% of India's employment, according to Invest India, the country's investment promotion arm.Mom-and-pop stores and 'kiranas'India's mom-and-pop stores sell everything from clothes and footwear to groceries and electronics. Most of India's grocery retail happens at kiranas - small- and mid-sized mom-and-pop outlets which account for 75-78% of the consumer goods market, Ambit Capital estimates.Store owners typically have a strong and regular customer base in their neighbourhood, with home delivery and taking orders on phone a common phenomenon.Hundreds of household items are crammed inside wall-to-wall glass or wooden shelves, or in the open, at such stores. Many outlets are so small and cramped that customers don't set foot inside - products are handed over by store staff who stand behind a counter.Many of these shops also offer staples - such as pulses, rice and flour - in loose or unbranded form. They typically operate from early morning till late evening.Supermarkets - Modern retailThis segment is a growing trend in India, with companies like Reliance Industries, led by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, Future Retail, led by Kishore Biyani, and Avenue Supermarts' DMart all competing for customers.This segment accounts for about 12-15% of consumer goods sales, according to Ambit. A long-established store format in the West, supermarkets are the polar opposite of kiranas; tidy, well-lit and with plenty of space for customers with shopping carts to seek out items from neatly stacked shelves themselves.Mini-supermarkets in built-up residential areas are also spreading in response to the need to cater to urban shoppers buying supplies in smaller volumes on a daily basis rather than in a once-a-week drill.

This is the third straight reduction in rate in one year. The price was cut by a steep 26 per cent to $2.39 in April last year.The rate paid to producers of new gas from difficult fields such as deepsea was cut to $4.06 per mmBtu from $5.61.The rate from October 1 is equivalent to the price paid to ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL) prior to May 2020 when formula-based pricing was first introduced.ONGC, sources said, had posted Rs 4,272 crore loss on gas business in 2017-18, which is likely to widen to over Rs 6,000 crore in the current fiscal (April 2020 to March 2021), they said.ONGC has seen incurring losses on the 65 million standard cubic meters per day of gas it produces from domestic fields shortly after the government in November 2014 introduced a new gas pricing formula that had ""inherent limitations"" as it was based on pricing hubs of gas surplus countries such as the US, Canada, and Russia.Sources said ONGC in a recent communique to the government has stated that the break-even price to produce gas from new discoveries was in the range of $5-9 per mmBtu.In May 2010, the government had raised the rate of gas sold to power and fertiliser firms from $1.79 per mmBtu to $4.20. ONGC and OIL got $3.818 per mmBtu price for the gas they produced from fields given to them on a nomination basis and after adding a 10 per cent royalty, the fuel cost $4.20 per mmBtu for consumers.The Congress-led UPA had approved a new pricing formula for implementation in 2014 that would have raised the rates but the BJP-led government scrapped it and brought a new formula.The new formula takes into account the volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (the UK), Alberta (Canada), and Russia with a lag of one-quarter. Prices are set every six months — on April 1 and October 1 each year.The rate at the first revision, using the new formula, came to $5.05 but in the subsequent six-monthly reviews kept falling till it touched $2.48 for April 2017 to September 2017 period.Subsequently, it rose to $3.69 in April 2019-September 2019 before being cut by 12.5 per cent in October 2019 to $3.23.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gas-price-for-ongc-to-inch-up-to-1-82-fall-below-4-for-reliance-bp/articleshow/81650316.cms,1,1.0

HMEL operates a 226,000 barrel per day (bpd) Bathinda refinery in the northern state of Punjab.India has asked refiners to speed up the diversification of imports to cut their dependence on Middle Eastern crudes after Opec+ decided this month to extend production cuts through April, two sources said.As Opec's share in India's oil imports fell to historic lows between April 2020 and January 2021, the refining powerhouse began making preparations to import Guyanese crude while renewing a key supply contract between top refiner Indian Oil Corp Ltd and Russia.The 1 million-barrel cargo of Guyana's Liza light sweet crude set sail on March 2 on Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Sea Garnet bound for India's Mundra port, where it is set to arrive around April 8. The cargo's charterer is Trafigura, according to the Eikon data.Guyana's natural resources minister, Vickram Bharrat, told Reuters this month that the crude onboard the Sea Garnet had been originally allocated to New York-based Hess Corp, one of the companies producing crude in Guyana along with Exxon Mobil Corp, and delivered to Trafigura. Bharrat said he did not know the identity of the cargo's ultimate buyer.Trafigura, Hess and HMEL declined to comment on commercial matters.Since Guyana began exporting crude in early 2020, its oil has flowed mainly to the United States, China, Panama and the Caribbean, according to tanker-tracking data.India was a prominent importer of Venezuelan oil, but tight US sanctions on the South American country have since 2019 limited the volume India can buy, if it is even allowed.India did not receive any Venezuelan crude imports in February for a third consecutive month due to Washington's suspension of oil-for-fuel swaps between state-run PDVSA and Reliance Industries Ltd since October. That compares with 371,300 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan oil that arrived in Indian ports in February 2020.Besides Russia, North American producers Canada, the United States and Mexico have gained market share by selling heavy crude grades to India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hpcl-mittal-first-indian-company-to-buy-guyanese-crude-liza-report/articleshow/81666158.cms,0,0.0

Murthy also emphasised that the interest of the company must always come ahead of the interest of the individual and that, when in doubt, disclose it. These are some of the principles the IT services major has been following right from its inception. Kotak Mahindra Bank MD Uday Kotak said that founders may not be there, but their institutions remain, citing examples of renowned financial services brands like Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan. Entrepreneurs need to be thinking about transformative change, which requires some bets in the short run, for building a more sustainable future, Kotak said. Another panel member Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said that women entrepreneurs face challenges in accessing capital as there is a perception that they are not risk-takers. Women need to have much more confidence in themselves and take big bets in the sector they operate in, Shaw said. Before the panel discussion, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, in his keynote address at the virtual award ceremony, said that startup entrepreneurs must be ready to work with limited resources but with unlimited determination, adding that they should not be deterred by failure, because only after many failures there is success. “Today, India is surging ahead as an economic power, as a democratic power, as a diplomatic and strategic power, as a cultural power and also a digital and technology power. And the key driving force for India’s rise will be our entrepreneurs, who are inventing new things every day that can transform India and the world, who are disruptive and hungry for success.” Marico chairman Harsh Mariwala won the EY EOY Award. He will now represent India at the EY World EOY Award on June 10. Mariwala transformed his family’s edible oil trading business into a consumer products major, Marico, whose several brands are household names in India.

These include one where Reliance Industries has tied up with Facebook and Google, another led by Paytm which has companies like Ola, while there is one led by the Tata Group with Mastercard, Bharti Airtel, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank as partners.The extended deadline for making the applications ended on Wednesday.ICICI Bank and Axis Bank will be co-leading the consortium with a 20 per cent stake each, officials in the know told PTI.Other partners, including Amazon, Billdesk, Pine Labs and Visa will be holding a stake of 15 per cent each, they said.The scope of activities for the NUE as mandated by RBI includes payment systems in the retail space like ATMs, white label point of sale terminals, Aadhar-based payment systems and remittance services, operation of clearing and settlement systems for participating banks and non-banks, be interoperable with NPCI, and participate in the Reserve Bank's payment and settlement systems.

They were penalised for alleged irregularities relating to the issue of 12 crore equity shares in January 2000 by Reliance Industries (RIL). Sebi imposed the penalty on Ambani family members and related entities since it was found that the takeover code was violated during the allotment of shares by RIL.According to Sebi’s order, in January 2000, RIL allotted 12 crore shares to 38 entities from within the Reliance Group. The allotment was made after exercise of the option on warrants attached with 6 crore non-convertible debentures (NCDs), which were issued in 1994. From the disclosure filed with the bourses by RIL, it was found that these 38 entities were ‘persons acting in concert’ (PACs) with RIL promoters. Through this conversion, RIL promoters together with the PACs had increased their stake in the company from 22.7% as of end-March 1999 to 38.3% as of end-March 2000. Out of these, 7.8% shares were acquired as a result of a merger and hence were exempt under the then prevailing Takeover Regulations.However, 6.8% shares that were acquired by RIL promoters together with PACs in exercise of 3 crore warrants were alleged to be in excess of the 5% ceiling under the same regulation. Hence the imposition of the Rs 25-crore fine on these entities, the Sebi order said.RIL was yet to comment on the Sebi order, which was issued on Wednesday evening. Sebi said that the Ambani brothers and all the other entities named in the order jointly and severally would pay the total fine within 45 days of the receipt of the order.The order noted that while determining the quantum of penalty, no quantifiable figures or data were available on record to assess the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage and amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default committed by the entities. “However, the fact remains that the (RIL group entities and promoters) by their failure to make public announcement, deprived the shareholders of their statutory rights/ opportunity to exit from the company,” it noted.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-fines-ambani-brothers-rs-25cr-in-21-year-old-case/articleshow/81958202.cms,1,1.0

Hamleys, a British retail icon that hasn’t made a profit for a number of years, plans to quadruple its outlets in the former British colony to more than 500 in three years despite the pandemic, according to Darshan Mehta, chief executive officer of Ambani’s Reliance Brands Ltd. Besides the main growth market, the company is also adding stores from Europe to South Africa and China, he said in an interview.Ambani, 63, bought Hamleys in 2019 to strengthen his retail footprint as part of the ongoing transformation of his oil-and-chemicals conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd into a consumer and technology behemoth. The deep pockets of Asia’s richest man and India’s demographics could help breathe new life into Hamleys, whose share of global toy sales was estimated at 0.6% last year by Euromonitor International, and see it avert the pitfalls faced by rivals such as Toys “R” Us Inc.With a backer whose net worth is $72 billion, Hamleys is seeking to tap into what it sees as an inadequately serviced section of India’s almost 1.4 billion people, of which about 27% are children under 14. The country accounts for just 1% of the $90 billion global toy industry, meaning the potential for growth is high, Mehta said.“There is a lot of headroom and India is no way near saturation,” Mehta said. “We are now mulling how we can roll out stores in newer geographies and new formats.”Hamleys stores are famed for the carnival-like experience, allowing children to race toy cars, enjoy model train sets and play various games. In a country like India, with its densely packed cities and limited entertainment options, such an environment could be a hook to get customers to visit again. Product prices appealing to buyers of modest means as well as the super-rich make Hamleys an “elastic brand,” said Mehta.In Asia, Hamleys is seen as “high class and it’s on par with Harrods in some ways,” said Marc Alonso, a London-based senior research analyst at Euromonitor. “So it’s attracting that customer base, which is why in some places like India and China, it has been seeing some good sales growth in the past few years.”While the pandemic has been hitting parts of India’s economy, Mehta sees the toy industry as ""recession proof"" because many families choose the happiness of kids over anything else. But other chains have struggled before the virus. Toys “R” Us was the biggest victim of the US retail apocalypse when it filed for bankruptcy in 2017, crushed by debt and felled by competition from online sellers such as Amazon.com Inc.Though the American chain is on a recovery path now under a new owner, a protracted pandemic points to an uncertain future for retailers.Nailing online sales is key to avoiding the fate of other high-end toy chains, according to Reliance. As part of Ambani’s e-commerce and technology pivot, his group is building Jiomart, a shopping portal, to take on giants such as Amazon.com and Walmart Inc’s Flipkart in the local market. Reliance Industries has roped in Facebook Inc and Google as investors to fuel those ambitions.With Covid-19 accelerating the group’s digital strategy, Mehta expects 30% of Hamleys’ sales coming from orders online in five years, versus 20% now. Direct selling over the phone or via WhatsApp would account for 20% in the same period, he said.Euromonitor’s Alonso said that target may be too ambitious because some customers could go to another portal that offers cheaper prices. “You can get the same product much cheaper by going straight to Lego, for example, on their e-commerce site,” said Alonso.Founded by William Hamley in 1760, Hamleys has seen its share of troubles. Ownership of the London-based chain has changed at least three times in the past decade alone -- from an Icelandic bank to a French group and then to a Chinese fashion retailer. Two years ago, Ambani snapped it up for about $89 million in cash. Hamleys’ most recent books for 2019 show a loss of almost 9 million pounds ($12.4 million) on revenue of about 48 million pounds.UK Retailers Prepare For Lockdown EasingEnvironmental services clean outside of the Regent Street store ahead of a reopening last year, on June 11. The flagship store has been closed for much of the past year. The onset of the pandemic just months after Reliance took control compounded Hamleys’ financial distress in the UK, where it runs 21 outlets. Like most shops in the deserted streets of London, its grand seven-story Regent Street flagship store that opened in 1881 remained closed for much of the past year until earlier this week, while it cut a quarter of its staff to weather the crisis.Mehta believes the UK operations will “come out very strongly” with non-essential stores reopening this week following the easing of curbs. Another coronavirus wave could temporarily disrupt the business globally -- like delayed plans for the US, a market it wants to crack.Prior to the acquisition of the chain, Reliance had the master franchise for Hamleys in India. The retail unit of Reliance is also the local partner for over 45 international brands including Burberry, Hugo Boss, Jimmy Choo and Tiffany & Co, according to the company’s website.The pandemic has limited Hamleys’ India target to just about 50 new stores this year before the roll out picks up pace. The toy retailer is looking at outlets in the US this year or next, depending on travel restrictions, as well as in tourist hot spots in European countries, including France and Italy, the Reliance executive said.Still, India is likely to be a key market, said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors. With about 26 million children born in the country each year, Hamleys is unlikely to be short of customers there even if only the top 5% of the population can afford to shop at its store, he said.“Toys is one category where emotions sometimes overtake your financial abilities,” said Singhal. “Hamleys is probably one of the best investments from Mr. Ambani’s point of view in retail -- the visibility the Hamleys brand has in India is unparalleled.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/asias-richest-man-mukesh-ambani-rebuilds-a-261-year-old-british-icon/articleshow/82043851.cms,1,1.5

The penal charges too will be waived under the recast plan.The recast plan has been approved by a RBI-constituted expert committee headed by K V Kamath.Banking sources said the debt recast is actually 'Plan B' to help the nation's largest retailer stay afloat. The recast will kick in only if the deal to sell Future's retail, wholesales, warehousing and logistics assets to Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) does not go through.If the Reliance deal goes through, the recast plan will be withdrawn.Lenders, they said, are still banking on 'Plan A' which is asset sale to RIL.So far, the consortium of lenders has approved the debt restructuring of Future Retail Ltd (FRL), Future Enterprises ltd (FEL) and Future Supply Chain Solutions Ltd. The restructuring plans of FEL and FRL have received approval from the RBI-constituted expert panel, sources said.The Rs 24,713 crore deal between RIL and Future Group was announced in August last year but it is getting delayed as e-Commerce major Amazon is contesting it at several forums, including an arbitration at SIAC and before the Supreme Court, which on Monday stayed the ongoing proceedings before the Delhi High Court.Citing delay, RRVL has also extended the timeline for the deal to be completed by six months to September 30, 2021.According to industry sources, debt resolution plans for two more Kishore Biyani-led Future Group companies -- Future Consumers and Future Lifestyle -- are also expected to be cleared by the consortium of lenders.The Expert Committee under the chairmanship of veteran banker K V Kamath has approved the debt resolution plans of FEL and FRL as permitted under the Reserve Bank of India''s resolution Framework for Covid-related stress, said the source.The RBI has set up a five-member expert committee under Kamath to suggest financial parameters for resolution of coronavirus-related stressed assets and all debt having aggregate exposure of Rs 1,500 crore or above have to be validated by it.The lenders and the board of both Future Group companies have already approved the respective restructuring plans. Now the companies and the lenders would have to complete other formalities and submit it finally before the RBI, the source added.Earlier this week, lenders of Future Supply Chain Solutions Ltd also approved the debt restructuring plan of the company, but as its total debt was below Rs 1,500 crore, it does not require approval from the Kamath panel.Future Supply Chain Solutions Ltd is the group's logistics company. It provides warehousing, distribution and other logistics solutions.A reply from Future Group regarding the development could not be ascertained by the time of filing of the story.FRL, which operates retail chain stores under several formats including Big Bazaar, fbb, HyperCity etc, has a consortium of 28 lenders and FEL has 19 lenders.Though both the companies have not specified their total debt under the restructuring in their regulatory filing but according to reports from Care Ratings, FRL has a loan of Rs 6,278 crore as of October 2020, and FEL has a loan of Rs 1,777 crore as of December 2020.FEL's loan includes long-term term loans of Rs 528 crore, long-term fund-based bank facilities of Rs 3,250 crore, and short-term non-fund based bank facilities of Rs 2,500 crore.While FRL debt includes long-term term loans of Rs 528 crore, long-term fund-based bank facilities of Rs 3,250 crore, and short-term non-fund based bank facilities of Rs 2,500 crore.The restructure would cover FRL's working capital demand loans, term loans, cash credit, short term loans, Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs), purchase bill discounting limits, other working capital loans and unpaid interest, which became overdue, it added.The e-Commerce major Amazon, which had invested in Future Coupons in August 2019, with an option of buying into the flagship Future Retail after a period of three to 10 years, is opposing the deal, claiming the first right.On October 25, 2020, an interim order was passed in favour of Amazon with a single-judge bench of V K Rajah barring Future Retail from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.The Supreme Court on Monday stayed the ongoing proceedings before the Delhi high court in the case related to the amalgamation of FRL with Reliance Retail.

Krishna Babu, along with Covid-19 special officer Arja Srikanth, health commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar, joint collector A S Dinesh Kumar and senior divisional commercial manager Narendra Varma visited Container Cargo Corporation Limited (Concor) depot at New Guntur railway station on Sunday to receive the second Oxygen Express from Reliance Industries in Jamnagar. The train carrying 76.39 MT of oxygen reached Guntur station in the early hours of Sunday.Taking into account the shortage of oxygen in the state, the Centre had directed the Railways to operate a special oxygen express to carry liquid medical oxygen (LMO) to the state. In view of the rise in Covid-19 cases and a surge in demand for LMO, Indian Railways created a signal-free ‘green corridor’ to provide safe, secure, hassle-free and fast transportation of oxygen to different parts of the country.The four containers of the train were dispatched to different locations in Krishna, West Godavari, Prakasam and Guntur districts.Speaking to the media, Krishna Babu said about 30,000 out of 50,000 beds with oxygen facility were created in government and private hospitals.

The deal may be announced next month as the details are still being worked on.“SoftBank may put in $500-550 million, while CPPIB or ADIA could lead the round,” said a person familiar with the development. “Existing investors such as GIC and Qatar Investment Authority could pool in with the rest of the funds.”83328365The development comes at a time when Bengaluru-headquartered Flipkart is trying to fend off a strong e-commerce push by deep-pocketed rivals such as US e-tailer Amazon, the Tata Group and Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL).“The funds will be used mainly to fuel supply chain growth and expansion of online grocery,” said a source. “There are pandemic-related tailwinds that have thrown up organic and inorganic growth opportunities. Flipkart may look at new categories such as epharmacy, online food delivery and healthcare.”RIL, which raised $15 billion last year from several investors, including Silver Lake, Facebook, Google and KKR, has been doubling down on its e-commerce play with Jiomart and Ajio. Similarly, the Tata Group, which operates Tata Cliq, acquired 64.3% in online grocer BigBasket for $1.5-2 billion and followed it up by investing $75 million in health and fitness startup Curefit. It is also closing in on online pharmacy 1mg.Flipkart, which raised $1.2 billion from parent Walmart last year, has been busy too. It has tried to expand its grocery play with Supermart and acquired online travel company Cleartrip. While it operates India’s largest fashion e-tailer Myntra, Flipkart bought a 27% stake in Arvind Youth Brands and forked out Rs 1,500 crore for an 8% stake in brick-and-mortar retailer Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail.Queries sent to ADIA, Soft-Bank and the Flipkart Group did not elicit responses, while a CPPIB spokesperson said the organisation does not want to comment on the story.“The timing of the fund raise is important and the new investors, including SoftBank, which has come back, creates a lot of credibility for the eventual valuation,” said the source.SoftBank, which invested $2.5 billion in Flipkart, sold off its entire 21% stake to Walmart in 2018 when the latter acquired 77% in the homegrown e-tailer for around $16 billion.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/flipkart-looks-to-raise-3-billion-at-35-billion-valuation/articleshow/83327344.cms,2,2.0

However, investors are optimistic about fund raising environment in 2021, primarily due to a rising limited partners' confidence in the Indian market, the report said.High traction is expected in IT/ITES, consumer tech, and healthcare sectors going forward, the report, adding that the BFSI sector is also set for recovery.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-industries-stake-sales-lead-to-38-jump-in-pe-investments-in-2020-report/articleshow/83374677.cms,1,1.0

Convener of Empowered Group on Oxygen & road transport and highway secretary Giridhar Aramane spoke to TOI about the plans.While the Covid caseload has decreased in urban areas, there are concerns relating to rural areas and we need to be prepared for the future. What is the government’s plan?Medical oxygen supply has been a very sensitive issue. The government has given a lot of thought while deciding how to ensure that all patients receive all medical supplies including oxygen. That’s why an empowered group was constituted and the government gave all the powers to procure oxygen without any delay. So, the first task was to increase the supply. Fundamental economic law says when supply increases, automatically the clamour for hoarding will come down. The government concentrated on ensuring availability of adequate quantity and several measures were taken. The first was, operating all the liquid oxygen plants to their full capacity. Second was increasing the capacity by technical improvement; like some manufacturers made some short term improvement to the technology and brought about 5-10% increase in production. One or two plants were commissioned in the last one year. Capacity of Reliance Industries went up from 300 to 1,000 tonnes a day. The other important thing was operating all these plants at their maximum capacity. They were producing 25-30% above their actual capacity. Third important measure was that the government realised that some areas don’t have any oxygen plants. So, under the PM Cares fund, 162 PSA plants were sanctioned. By now we have installed 102 of them and the remaining will be installed and commissioned in the next one month. Another 1,051 PSA plants under the PM Cares fund have been approved. So, every district will get at least one and some will get more than one. This entire system will create capacity for generating another 2,500 tonnes of medical oxygen. Some top companies are manufacturing these plants. Our total capacity after installation of these plants will go up to around 12,500 tonnes per day, which was barely around 6,000 tonnes last year.What is the plan for meeting demands in rural areas?Rural areas also need medical oxygen and we have to supply this in a different manner. We can’t put such PSA plants in 50 bedded or 30 bedded health centres. There, we will have to supply through cylinders. Last year the government procured around 7 lakh cylinders and distributed them throughout the country. The total cylinder available has gone up from 4.5 lakhs to 11 lakhs in the last one year. Another 1.27 lakh are being distributed to states and orders have been placed for 1.5 lakh more cylinders. Apart from cylinders the government is also procuring oxygen concentrators for mild and moderate patients under PM Cares funds. This will be useful in smaller locations.There are some inputs that private hospitals are not keen to put PSA plants for certain interests. How is the government dealing with this?My information is that even private hospitals are very interested in having these plants because they have realized that in a crisis having some in-house capacity will help, if not for 500 beds. Big hospitals may have at least these plants to cater to ICU requirements that will ensure that they have emergency supply. So, in a way that will ensure an increase in availability and the requirement for transportation and logistics will also reduce. What the government has done is it has created a supply system for PSA plants also. So, we have enabled large scale manufacturers in the country who will be able to supply a large number of PSA plants in short terms. The private hospitals can also buy them at lower cost and get better quality. We have also tied up the maintenance and the companies will maintain them.So, will this be some kind of permanent solution? Will this help us prepare for any future crisis?This will be a permanent solution. Once all these PSA plants are installed, there will be no such big problem with medical oxygen demand.How did you manage the crisis when every state was demanding more medical oxygen and amid several accusations?In a crisis, India reacts as one. The Prime Minister had meetings with the CMs and all officers; the cabinet secretary held review meetings with chief secretaries of states. One night I called up Maharashtra chief secretary to send a tanker to Goa and he willingly sent it. Similarly, Karntaka themselves were in a serious state at one time, but when we requested them to spare tankers to Maharashtra and Telnagana, they happily did so. When we requested Kerala chief secretary to share some oxygen to Tamil Nadu, even when they were not getting their full quota, the state government gave some from its quota to Tamil Nadu. It was Indian in action and there was no Centre-state issue.How was the response of states like Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand since most of the medical oxygen was coming from these states?They were extremely supportive. Ultimately, everyone realizes that either we survive as a nation or we will all perish together – swim or sink together. All the states know about it.Was it a 24X7 operation for the empowered group during the crisis?Yes we were alert 24X7. In a day, there were 2,000-3,000 messages. There were more messages and alerts from Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Goa. We kept on receiving messages throughout the night. The entire logistics chain was throwing up issues - from behavior of plant manager to police stopping tankers, no availability of driver for another tanker, delay on parts of some states in sending back containers and need for arranging aircrafts to lift empty tankers. All members of the main group and sub-groups were available throughout. Home secretary and cabinet secretary were the last one to go to bed. I don’t think they even slept from April 21 to April 30. We were getting calls and messages from them at 12.30 am, 1.30am and even at 2.30 am.Had you ever dealt with such a crisis in your career?The scale of this crisis is much bigger. In 1989, I dealt with a major cyclone that hit a coastal district in Andhra Pradesh. I was very young and was posted as Tehsildar there. We had to undertake relief and rehabilitation work for 15 days. I did not sleep for 15 days. That time there was no mobile.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/it-was-india-in-action-during-o2-crisis-oxygen-empowered-group-convener/articleshow/83501632.cms,2,2.0

The energy transition will allow RIL to participate in India's energy consumption growth story over a longer horizon,"" it said.Ambani expects to conclude the sale of a 20 per cent stake in O2C business to Saudi Aramco this year but the extent of upfront cash component in the transaction will determine the extent of the benefit to RIL, brokerages said, adding an all-cash transaction will also reduce RIL's carbon footprint.""RIL's AGM focused on the next hypergrowth opportunity in cleantech and its path to decarbonisation. The 'mega' plan is unique in a global context in multiple ways, has potential to spur re-rating, raises clarity on the investment cycle, and reduces investor worry about holdco discount,"" Morgan Stanley said.Its decarbonisation plan involves capturing the hypergrowth market of manufacturing solar cells, electrolysers, and fuel cells, while steadily pivoting its energy operations to green hydrogen, carbon fibre, e-fuels, and green chemicals.""The single location energy complex will be key to this plan and supports hyper-integration of the supply chain, utilities, and end energy use. ""The plan also helps diversify the revenue stream from India-centric consumer and chemicals businesses to international opportunities, via exports of hardware for energy transition as well as hydrogen,"" it said.Kotak Securities said RIL's plans for the new energy and new materials business may be initially focused on integrated manufacturing of solar photovoltaic modules, while the investments in other parts of the value chain may likely be back-ended.The company may benefit from the recent policy initiatives by the government to encourage domestic manufacturing of solar equipment, which is otherwise imported in large proportion currently.These initiatives include customs duty of 25 per cent and 40 per cent on imports of solar PV cells and solar PV modules to be imposed from April 1, 2022, Rs 4,500 crore of payments under the production-linked incentive scheme for National Programme on High-Efficiency Solar PV Modules, and access of cheap electricity, term loans, and working capital financing.""These incentives will meaningfully improve the economics for domestic players, who currently grapple with 10 per cent higher operating costs and sub-scale inefficient capacity compared to the Chinese counterparts,"" it said.It estimated that 1 GW of an integrated solar module capacity may require Rs 3,500-4,000 crore of investments and RIL's target to enable 100+ GW of solar energy generation by 2030 may require it to set up a solar module capacity of 10-15 GW.Citi said the announcements on clean energy are prima facie promising and should help pivot the company towards a low carbon future, though details are limited and paybacks uncertain.BofA said while a good decision from a long-term perspective, the capex investments, coupled with investment in 5G, will likely push RIL away from its recently achieved zero net-debt position to slight debt position.HSBC said RIL should benefit from the Performance Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes that the government is rolling out for PV manufacturing and advanced energy storage plants.The government has already come up with a PLI scheme for advanced chemistry cell battery manufacturing (Rs 18,000 crore) for setting up 50GWH capacity in the country for EV and grid storage usages. Any player can bid for 5GWH to 20GWH capacity in this scheme.Also, a PLI scheme for solar modules manufacturing (Rs 4500 crore) for 10GW capacity has been announced. Players have to bid for at least 1GW capacity.Stating that in the run-up to the AGM, the market had expected more details on the Jio phone launch and progress on the Aramco deal, HSBC said Ambani did talk about the Jio phone being ""ultra-affordable"" but did not give out pricing and specifications.Goldman Sachs said the company's comments make it believe that competition in India's internet space, especially e-commerce, will increase in the short-to-medium term.Comments around JioMart suggest strong traction and increases the confidence of the firm reaching a turnover of USD 19 billion, or 50 per cent share of online grocery, by FY25.Credit Suisse said the total addressable market (TAM) for Jio's smartphone would be 150 million of the 400 million current feature users (including JioPhones).",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/clean-tech-next-hypergrowth-opportunity-for-reliance-say-brokerages/articleshow/83844508.cms,0,0.5

The two entities were incorporated a little over a fortnight before RIL unveiled its green energy plans at its annual shareholder meet on June 24. In February this year, Anant, 26, was inducted as a director of Reliance O2C, where Saudi Aramco is expected to be an investor, and a year before that, he was appointed on the board of Jio Platforms, where his siblings Isha and Akash too are members. RIL didn’t respond to a questionnaire from TOI. While Mukesh Ambani, 64, hasn’t yet spelt out succession planning at RIL, questions like ‘who’s next?’ have started popping up within the investor community. In Ambani’s own case, after the death of his father, RIL founder Dhirubhai Ambani, in 2002, there was a feud over succession between him and his brother Anil.  84131021Dhirubhai had not left a will and the family business had to be split, with Mukesh gaining RIL (oil refining and petrochemicals) and Anil getting the energy, finance and telecom units as part of the settlement.Besides Jio Platforms, Isha and Akash, the 29-year-old twins, are on the board of Reliance Retail Ventures. Both Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail Ventures had attracted billions of dollars in investments and brought on board global names such as Google, Facebook, Silver Lake and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to help expand their digital and e-commerce footprint. With Anant’s latest board appointments, all the three children now have representation in RIL’s key businesses. After the recent separation of the refining and petrochemicals unit to Reliance O2C, RIL looks similar to Tata Sons, the holding company of Tata Group’s diverse businesses. RIL is also paving the way for initial public offerings of Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail Ventures, which are expected to take place in the near future. Apart from Reliance New Energy Solar and Reliance New Solar Energy, RIL incorporated five other entities since June — Reliance New Energy Storage, Reliance Solar Projects, Reliance Storage, Reliance New Energy Carbon Fibre and Reliance New Energy Hydrogen Electrolysis. Their names indicate that the entities were established for the clean energy game.All the seven companies have three directors each. A common director in all these entities is Shanker Natarajan.At the annual shareholder meeting last month, Ambani said that RIL will invest Rs 75,000 crore in clean energy over three years, but details about how it intends to execute the green play have not been disclosed. RIL’s renewable power move comes more than a decade after Mukesh and Anil cancelled all non-compete business agreements between them.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/youngest-ambani-takes-seat-on-boards-of-rils-2-new-solar-cos/articleshow/84125501.cms,2,2.0

Adani, 59, is a self-made billionaire who has focused on electricity generation, transmission and distribution and the operation of ports and airports.The two billionaires - and Modi - are all from the western Indian state of Gujarat.Ambani announced last month he will build 100 GW in solar energy capacity over the next nine years. He said his group would spend $10 billion over the next three years in building solar manufacturing units, a battery factory for energy storage, a fuel cell factory, and a unit to produce green hydrogen.Three days later, Adani announced that his green energy venture would add 5 GW every year this decade, from a current level of about 3.5 GW.Analysts say there is sufficient space for multiple companies to grow as a part of India's ambitious green energy target, but tariffs could fall further as companies try to outdo each other in aggressive bidding wars to win projects.Solar tariffs are already among the lowest in the world, having fallen below Rs 2 ($0.0269) per kilowatt hour in auctions conducted in Gujarat.""I would expect by 2030 that they (solar tariffs) will probably touch 1 rupee per kilowatt hour,"" said Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies at the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.Reliance has a track record of disrupting rival businesses. With cheap smartphones and data plans, its telecom venture Jio has in five years dethroned market leaders Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel to become the largest telecom operator in India.Coal and power may decline Both Ambani and Adani have built businesses based on fossil fuels. Reliance runs the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat while Adani is India's largest private sector operator of coal-fired thermal stations and the country's largest coal trader.India is the world's third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. Coal-based power generation could drop dramatically as the major players go green, analysts say.Rishab Shrestha, senior analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie said he expects India's coal generation share to drop to 50% in early 2030s from over 70% currently.""We expect cost of building new coal plants in India to be $62/MWh by 2030, 25% higher than that of solar,"" Shrestha said.Adani has not announced plans to build any new thermal power plants, and his companies are unlikely to be affected by relatively higher costs of coal-fired power.Both groups are trying to improve their clean energy credentials as investors pay more attention to the environmental impact of their businesses and make decisions based on ESG ratings, analysts say.One of Adani's main businesses, Adani Green Energy, currently dominates India's renewables space. Its shares have soared over 156% in the past year.Ambani wants Reliance to become net carbon zero by 2035, much ahead of 2050 target of global oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP.""Reliance will emerge as the most credible renewables player in the country in the next two years. Its ESG scores will also improve, meaningfully attracting money from ESG funds globally,"" Jefferies said in a note.If both companies hit their targets, Reliance's targeted solar capacity of 100 GW will be twice as large as Adani's, and the companies would together account for a third of all of India's 2030 target.Adani, who has faced criticism for developing a coal mine in Australia and doing business with entities a rights group says are linked to the Myanmar armed forces, needs to do more to attain better sustainability scores, Buckley said.The Adani group has denied links to the Myanmar military, and said it could write down an investment in a port terminal in Myanmar. It has said the Australian coal mine created jobs for the locals, and was critical to ensuring energy security.""Financial markets are not agnostic to ESG, so he has to walk the talk,"" Buckley said.

As they sought alternatives, some turned to technology and automation to bridge the gap.83736093For Tarun Kumar Mishra, co-founder of Detect Technologies Pvt Ltd, it was the perfect opportunity for his product: a real-time pipeline monitoring system that tracks leaks and corrosion using sensors and artificial intelligence. In 2014, tycoon Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd made a rare $100,000 investment in Mishra, which helped fund the initiative.“Technology adoption increased substantially,” Mishra said. “The Covid-19 outbreak forced everyone to break the inertia of working with a certain process that’s been in place for 50 to 60 years. They either had to shut down the plant or try a new way.”Forcing changeWith the funds, the 32-year-old Mishra said he roped in students who joined him with only food as an incentive. The company has since built another product utilizing drones programmed to inspect sites and equipment including refineries, power plants and reactors.The startup then won a contract from Royal Dutch Shell Plc in 2019 to monitor a petrochemicals plant in Pennsylvania and now counts companies including Reliance and Bharat Petroleum Corp in India, as well as global energy majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp as customers.“We are benefiting from their drone-based monitoring of our plants and inspection of our tanks,” said Arun Kumar Singh, director of marketing and refineries at Bharat Petroleum. “That’s become all the more relevant right now as we are operating with a lesser number of people to avoid exposure.”83806690Detect is also working with Adani Transmission Ltd, which supplies electricity to Mumbai, to avoid a repeat of a grid collapse last year that contributed to its worst blackout in decades.

The report published on July 15 states that the company’s new energy business strategy can contribute almost 10% of the company’s total EBITDA by FY26 if all goes as planned. The report ‘Green machine. How much is the new energy worth?’ says that RIL’s strategy is analogous to the ‘pick shovels over mines’ approach. “Many oil companies have tried and failed to become clean energy manufacturing companies and instead focus on clean energy production. RIL focus on manufacturing is distinctive and potentially offers higher margins but is also higher risk given their limited capabilities in clean energy,” it says.RIL will need to find partners to work with them given the technology requirements needed for fuel cells and batteries.Last month, RIL announced its plan to spend Rs 75,000 crore over the next few years for the new energy business. It will spend Rs 60,000 crore to construct four “giga factories” to make integrated solar PV modules, electrolyzers, fuel cells and batteries to store energy from the grid. The site of these plants will be located at the new 5,000 acres Green Energy Giga Complex in Jamnagar. For solar, RIL is planning to enter the solar manufacturing and generation with a target of 100GW of solar energy by 2030.From oil and gas to telecom, to retail & internet, it's hard to think of another company which has re-invented itself as much as RIL has done over the past decade, the report states while calling it a bold move.While it is unclear as to whether RIL will be successful, it is too early to discount them given their track record of successfully disrupting other industries, such as telecom and retail, it adds.Many integrated oil and gas companies have announced plans to invest in solar, wind or hydrogen production as they transition their portfolios away from fossil fuels and towards low carbon energy.“But what is unique about RIL’s strategy is that they are focusing on the equipment required to produce clean energy rather than clean energy production itself. For example, RIL will be manufacturing solar PV panels and energy storage equipment (batteries), rather than investing in solar power,” it said.Here comes the sunThe logic of investing in clean energy is compelling as $70 trillion are likely be spent globally on the energy transition over the next 30 years, according to the report. While India has yet to declare a net zero target, the direction towards low carbon is clear. With solar becoming cheaper than coal and hydrogen reaching cost parity with diesel, there are clear economic and energy security reasons to believe that India will transition towards clean energy.

We are committed to comply with the laws of India and will extend full cooperation to the CCI on this matter,"" an Amazon spokesperson said on Thursday.The spokesperson exuded confidence that the company will be able to address the CCI's concerns.""However, as our dispute with Future is pending litigation, and we are also bound by confidentiality obligations, we are unable to comment on the merits or substance of any allegations at this stage...,"" the spokesperson said.There were no immediate comments from Future Group.On Thursday, Future Group submitted a copy of CCI's notice to Amazon to the Supreme Court, which is hearing a plea filed by Amazon related to the ongoing dispute.In November 2019, CCI had given its approval for Amazon to acquire a 49 per cent stake in Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCL). FCL is a shareholder in Future Retail Ltd.CCI had sent the notice to Amazon on June 4. The notice pertains to Amazon's submissions while seeking a nod for the FCL deal, the sources said.Deals beyond a certain threshold require approval from CCI. The watchdog has wide powers, including to revoke its clearance for any transaction if it is found at any time that the information provided by the acquirer was incorrect.In the notice, CCI has alleged Amazon of concealing its strategic interest over Future Retail and that such interest was not disclosed to the regulator previously.Apart from non-disclosure, false and incorrect representations have also been made in relation to the 2019 transaction, according to the notice, a copy of which was seen by PTI.""... you are being issued this show cause notice to explain, in writing, as to why you shall not be found to have -- failed to give notice in respect of FRL SHA (Future Retail Ltd Shareholding Agreement) and furnished false and incorrect information and concealed/ suppressed material facts, in contravention of the said provisions of the (Competition) Act,"" it said.In August 2019, Amazon had agreed to purchase 49 per cent of one of Future's unlisted firms, FCL (which owns 7.3 per cent equity in BSE-listed Future Retail Ltd through convertible warrants), with the right to buy into the flagship Future Retail after a period of three to 10 years.A year later, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd had entered into a pact with Future Group to acquire the retail and wholesale business and the logistics and warehousing business for Rs 24,713 crore.Amazon dragged Future Group into arbitration at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), arguing that its 2019 deal prevents the selling of Future Retail Ltd business to rivals. In October last year, an interim award was passed by the Emergency Arbitrator (EA) in favour of the US-e-commerce major.The EA barred Future Retail from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party. Amazon and Future Group have also filed litigations in Indian courts, including the Supreme Court, on the issue.The SIAC has concluded its hearing on the plea filed by Amazon in the matter and is likely to pronounce a judgement in a month.The Future Group-Reliance deal was initially expected to close by March-end. However, in April, Reliance Industries said it was extending the timeline for the ""Long Stop Date"" from March 31, 2021, to September 30, 2021.The deal has received clearance from regulators such as CCI, Sebi and bourses, and the scheme of arrangement is now awaiting a nod from the NCLT and shareholders.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cci-issues-notice-to-amazon-seeks-explanation-on-fcl-deal-submissions-made-in-2019/articleshow/84655259.cms,2,1.5

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s retail-to-refining empire had more than 236,300 employees as of March 31.Coronavirus: Live updatesReliance joins the local unit of consumer giant Unilever, which has given at least one shot to about 90% of its employees, or more than 88,000 people, and technology firms Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys Ltd., which have inoculated 70% and 59% of their workforces respectively.The ability of private companies to source and administer shots shows the disparity developing in India, where the organized sector accounts for less than 20% of the workforce. India has administered at least one dose to just 25% of its 1.3 billion population, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker, versus more than 50% in China and the US.Meanwhile, some states continue to struggle with sporadic vaccine shortages, blunting India’s overall efforts to avert a virus resurgence. India’s second wave of a few months ago, driven by the delta variant first identified there, overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums, highlighting the urgent need for vaccine supplies to be boosted in the country and to the wider developing world, where the lack of access to shots is a growing concern.Breaking pointIndia has for months struggled to ramp up its immunization campaign and has relied on the private sector to ease the burden on public health-care facilities, which were stretched to breaking point in the wave of infections that peaked in May.At its current rate of vaccination, India is projected to take 1.1 years to inoculate 75% of its population with two doses, according to Bloomberg’s tracker. That puts it well behind many developed countries, and some emerging economies, like China, Malaysia and Cambodia, as well.Still, the Serum Institute of India Ltd, the world’s biggest vaccine producer, has slowly boosted average monthly output to more than 100 million doses of the AstraZeneca Plc shot they’re contracted to make, while India’s other main supplier -- Bharat Biotech International Ltd -- is churning out about 25 million doses of its Covaxin vaccine each month, Bharati Pravin Pawar, the country’s junior health minister, said last week.While the central government has denied any vaccine supply gaps, as many as 3 million people in the north-western state of Rajasthan missed their second dose due to a lack of supplies. The southern state of Tamil Nadu has also been seeing a supply deficit, according to local media reports.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/covid-19-reliance-inoculates-98-of-workers-as-indias-wider-rollout-lags/articleshow/84784928.cms,1,1.3333333333333333

The India expansion is part of the company’s plan to double its manufacturing capacity to 16 GW by 2024 and make it the largest module manufacturer in India.This is the second announcement of a GW-size domestic solar module making plan following the government’s PLI (performance-linked incentive) scheme for promoting domestic manufacturing. Reliance Industries Ltd had recently announced a $10 billion green energy plan that included setting up giga-size integrated module-making facility.Industry analysts said these announcements could prompt Chinese module manufacturers, who dominate the Indian market, to consider manufacturing in India in view of its ambition of creating 450 GW renewable energy capacity by 2030.The company said the facility would have the advanced manufacturing technology established for its recently-announced facility in Ohio.“India is an attractive market for First Solar not simply because our module technology is advantaged in its hot, humid climate. It is an inherently sustainable market, underpinned by a growing economy and appetite for energy, with a well-defined goal that will need over 25 GW of solar to be deployed annually for the next nine years,” according to company CEO Mark Widmar.“Crucially, it has combined its clean energy targets with effective trade and industrial policy designed to enable self-sufficient domestic manufacturing and true energy security. We also have many long-standing consumers in the country that will be pleased to have access to an advanced photovoltaic module, which is made in India, for India,” Widmar added.The company has so far supplied nearly 2 GW solar modules to projects in India, which is its second-largest market after North America.

The scope of this joint venture, IndianOil Petronas Pvt Ltd (IPPL), is now being expanded to include fuel and natural gas marketing.For one, IPPL will not be governed by the tedious petrol pump allotment rules that require public sector oil marketing companies to appoint dealers through a draw of a lottery. The joint venture can choose a site and operator quickly and on commercial terms.""We have all options open - IPPL can set up new retail outlets, it can set up wayside amenities (at petrol pumps on National Highways) and we can also monetise some of our existing retail outlets by selling them to the joint venture,"" Gupta said at an investor call.IPPL can set up petrol pumps that will not just sell petrol and diesel but also have EV charging and battery swapping points as well as CNG/LPG and LNG dispensing stations.This will be roughly on lines of the outlets that Reliance Industries and its partner BP Plc of UK are setting up.Gupta said fuel marketing business is opening up that requires agility in operations.State-owned fuel retailers such as IOC have to allot dealerships through a lottery of all eligible candidates. It does not allow discretion.Also, wayside amenities such as food court can be set up with IPPL, he said.IPPL currently sells LPG to commercial customers who are not allowed to use subsidised cooking gas sold to households by state energy firms.IOC owns 32,303 out of 77,709 petrol pumps in the country. It also has licences to retail CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households in several geographical areas.Last week, IOC Chairman S M Vaidya had said that IPPL will have its own branding and marketing.Asked if IPPL's foray in retailing will not cannibalise on IOC's business, he had said India's energy demand is growing and will have space for all players.""Energy pie is increasing. There is a place for everybody,"" he said. ""Our (IOC's) market share is intact and IPPL will capture new opportunities.""IPPL will be the 7th fuel retailer in the country.

India also does not have lithium reserves, the majority of which are controlled by China globally.This makes EVs a hard sell in a country like India where per capita income is around $2,000, or about 5% of that in Europe and Japan, and 95% of cars sold are priced below $20,000, Maruti Chairman RC Bhargava told shareholders in the company's annual report.""We need to recognise that our strategy for moving towards net zero emission has to be consistent with the economic and infrastructure conditions prevailing in the country,"" Bhargava said.To reduce fuel consumption and emissions, Maruti is pushing sales of cars that operate on compressed natural gas (CNG), and is also investing in hybrid technology, he said, adding that ""the use of hydrogen is also an interesting alternative"".Suzuki Motor Corp, which controls Maruti, is also prioritising development of clean technologies suitable for the Indian market, Bhargava said, adding that Suzuki's alliance with Toyota Motor Corp in Japan would prove valuable for this effort.Bhargava's comments come as debate around EVs is gathering steam in India, with Tesla Inc lobbying the government to lower import duties on electric cars.Tesla's demands have polarised India's auto industry, with South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co - which has a share of about 18% of the country's car market and is Maruti's closest competitor - supporting a tax cut on imports.Maruti's comments in support of hydrogen also come weeks after Mukesh Ambani, chairman of refiner Reliance Industries , said it would invest $10 billion in clean energy, including setting up giga factories to produce fuel cells and green hydrogen.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/cars/maruti-suzuki-sees-hydrogen-as-interesting-alternative/articleshow/84999232.cms,1,1.0

Reliance, which is backed by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, could reach an agreement with Aramco as soon as the coming weeks, the people said.Shares in Reliance extended gains to as much as 2.6% in Mumbai after the Bloomberg News report.A deal would forge a closer alliance between the world’s biggest oil exporter and one of the fastest-growing consumers. Ties and trade between the two countries have grown in recent years as India looks to bolster its energy security and Saudi Arabia reduces its support for Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir. Riyadh and New Delhi elevated their relationship to a “strategic partnership” in 2019.It would seal more than two years of negotiations and mark Aramco’s first all-stock deal since its initial public offering in 2019. Ambani confirmed talks about a deal with an implied stake valuation of $15 billion that same year. Discussions were delayed by the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and slump in oil prices.Energy markets have since recovered, with crude prices jumping around 35% this year to almost $70 a barrel. Aramco said last week due diligence on a deal with Reliance was underway.A transaction would boost Aramco’s sales of crude to India. For Reliance, it would help to lock in a steady supply of oil for its giant refineries and make the Indian company a shareholder in Aramco. Based on Aramco’s market valuation of about $1.9 trillion, a transaction would give Reliance a stake of around 1%.Details of the potential transaction are still being negotiated, and talks could drag on longer or fall apart, the people said. A representative for Aramco declined to comment. The Saudi government’s Center for International Communication didn’t immediately respond to an email requesting comment.Saudi goalsA representative for Reliance said the company does not have anything to add beyond Ambani’s comments at the shareholders’ meeting in June, when the conglomerate appointed Aramco Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan to the board. Ambani had said Reliance could finalise an investment deal with the oil producer this year.The Saudi government sold 2% of Aramco in the IPO, raising almost $30 billion. It’s still the largest first-time share sale on record.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler, said in April that the kingdom was in talks to sell a 1% stake in Aramco to a “leading global energy company.” He didn’t disclose which one.“This deal could be very important in strengthening Aramco’s sales in the country where this company resides,” the prince had said.Saudi Arabia shipped 613,000 barrels a day of crude to India in July, around 10% of its total exports.The transaction would help Aramco reach its goal of more than doubling refining capacity to between 8 million and 10 million barrels of crude a day.

The only others are Reliance Industries, TCS and HDFC Bank, with m-caps of $186 billion, $180 billion and $116 billion, respectively.The milestone was achieved in morning trade on Tuesday when Infosys shares touched a year high of Rs 1,755 on the BSE. This took the m-cap to $100.7 billion. The stock closed at Rs 1,720, down 1%. On the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) too, Infosys’s m-cap was close to $100 billion in morning trade.While Infosys took 20 years to reach $50 billion in m-cap, the next $50 billion took just over a year, an astonishing growth rate under its CEO Salil Parekh. 85615840 IT companies are seeing a smart recovery from the pandemic, thanks to their clients’ desire for digital transformation through cloud and increased focus on data and analytics.Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai said, “In 1994, Infosys had a valuation of $100 million. In 27 years, it has crossed $100 billion, and it’s a great story. Infosys’s rise reflects the rise of India after liberalisation and the rise of the global IT services industry. It should have come earlier, except for the disruption caused in the firm.”Marti G Subrahmanyam, who is the Charles E Merrill professor of finance, economics and international business in the Stern School of Business at New York University, and who was on the board of Infosys from 1998 to 2011, recollects that when he joined the company, it had revenue of $47 million and 1,500 employees. “They raised the bar for corporate-governance ethics in India. The board wasn’t merely an adornment to be seen. My views were respected and I had several heated debates with the management. The secret sauce is good governance, values and ethics, hard work and NRN’s vision,” he said.It has been a fabled journey for the Bengaluru company that was started by NR Narayana Murthy along with six others in 1981. It was listed on the Indian stock market in 1993 and became the first Indian registered company to list on a US stock exchange, Nasdaq, in 1999. Infosys has long been considered the gold standard for corporate governance among Indian corporates. “When in doubt, always disclose,” was Murthy’s mantra. In a webinar last year, Murthy said, “The good thing about Infosys founders is that they were high in aspiration, they were confident, they were hardworking and had good values, but we had very little money. For the first 13 years or so, none of us had a car, all of us lived in rented houses… Therefore, there was a little bit of dissatisfaction among some of the spouses.”Vallabh Bhanshali, cofounder and chairman of Enam Group and who helped launch Infosys’s IPO, said, “To me, Infosys’s value lies not so much in its market cap as much as in what it has done to arouse aspirations among Bhartiya to create enterprises that will earn the admiration of all. How that can happen only with better governance has contributed hugely to the gradual transformation of the corporate world. $100 billion is only an intermediate milestone for a company that is still young and hungry,” he told TOI. When Enam concluded the Infosys IPO, the issue had been “barely subscribed”.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/infosys-becomes-fourth-indian-firm-to-touch-100-billion-market-cap/articleshow/85612033.cms,2,2.0

The treatment provided here was on a par with private hospitals and hundreds of lives were saved. We appreciate the work done by the doctors and BMC staff,” said Congress corporator Ravi Raja, Opposition leader in the BMC. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra concurred. “Instead of spending money on temporary jumbo centres, the BMC must build more permanent hospitals, like SevenHills, to save lives,” he said.SevenHills Hospital was initially set up in 2010 as a public-private partnership between a Vizag-based hospital chain and the BMC, which provided land in lieu of free beds and treatment for poor patients. It was a 1,500-bed hospital, including 300 ICU beds, but was later shut down after a prolonged legal dispute between the two parties over treatment costs.A day after Maharashtra reported its first two Covid cases on March 9, 2020, former BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi toured the defunct Marol hospital and mobilised funds to revive it within a week. Mission ‘renew SevenHills’ started the very day Mumbai reported its first two Covid cases—on March 11, 2020—and the first international traveller walked into the quarantine facility set up on the eighth floor on March 14, 2020. Mumbai thus got India’s first Covid-19 dedicated hospital, which was fully funded by Reliance Industries Ltd. Civic officials said that between March and December 2020, the BMC spent Rs 118.7 crore on setting up and running the 300-bed hospital, and from January to March 2021, it spent Rs 63.9 crore. According to officials, the BMC has till date spent around Rs 150 crore per month on Covid-19 mitigation—a total of Rs 2,500 crore. Every year, the BMC keeps aside some money in its contingency fund. “Wh-en the pandemic broke out, we had around Rs 1,000 crore in the contingency fund, but all that money was spent to fight Covid-19. Another Rs 450 crore was needed to foot the bills when the financial year ended in March 2021,” an official said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-in-1st-wave-bmc-spent-rs-182-6cr-to-revive-run-sevenhills-hosp/articleshow/85639272.cms,2,2.0

With the RBI mostly remaining on the sidelines, the rupee on Tuesday closed 26 paise higher at 73.01 to a dollar from Monday’s close of 73.27, and 68 paise from Friday’s 73.69.85821693The Indian currency had increased by 53 paise on Friday on the back of huge flows after a bank raised $1 billion through an overseas bond offering. The gains on Monday and Tuesday were due to FPI flows, dealers said. The recent strong foreign flows came after these funds took out about Rs10,000 crore net from Indian stocks since July1, official data showed. The rising rupee had mostly kept the software exporters from joining the rally. But on Tuesday, these stocks witnessed strong buying.The session’s gains in the sensex were led by Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Finance and TCS, while selling in Reliance Industries, Nestle and IndusInd Bank limited the northward movement of the index, BSE data showed.According to LKP Securities head (research) S Ranganathan, strong buying in FMCG and software biggies, along with Airtel, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv, made the market rally “look effortless” ahead of the Q1 GDP numbers.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bull-run-another-day-of-sensex-nifty-highs/articleshow/85821679.cms,0,0.0

The company, which has been funding capital-intensive infrastructure projects such as roads, railways and power for more than six decades, may instead focus on “profit-maximizing investments” after the IPO, Kumar said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is looking to dilute as much as 10% stake in LIC as part of a broader divestment target to help plug a widening budget gap. The sale, which is set to be the country’s biggest, could value the company at as much as $261 billion, surpassing Reliance Industries Ltd., according to analysts at Jefferies India.The trade union, which represents about 4,000 of LIC’s roughly 114,000 employees, has written to the prime minister and members of Parliament to protest about the listing and is planning campaigns to raise concerns about the share sale, Kumar said.“We believe that selling national asset is a willfully disruptive policy,” he said. “Recruitment will be minimal, outsourcing will happen and job losses will take place.”The government last month picked 10 banks for the sale that’s planned for between January and March 2022.

Modi is betting the private sector can help farmers boost yields with apps and tools built from information such as crop output, soil quality and land holdings. Jio Platforms Ltd., the venture controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd., and tobacco giant ITC Ltd. are among local powerhouses that have signed up for the program, the government said this week.With the project, Modi is seeking to usher in long-due reforms to make over a $488 billion farm sector that employs almost half of the nation’s 1.3 billion people and accounts for about 18% of Asia’s third-biggest economy. The government is counting on the project’s success to boost rural incomes, cut imports, reduce some of the world’s worst food wastages with better infrastructure, and eventually compete with exporters such as Brazil, the US and the European Union. For global firms, it’s a stab at India’s agri-tech industry, which Ernst & Young estimates to have the potential to reach about $24 billion in revenue by 2025, with the current penetration being only 1%. It’s also a chance to deploy networks, artificial intelligence and machine learning in a developing country, while for e-commerce firms such as Amazon and Reliance, securing a steady stream of farm produce could help crack a groceries market that accounts for well over half of the $1 trillion in annual retail spending by Indians.“This is a high impact industry and private players are sensing the opportunity and want to be a large part of it,” said Ankur Pahwa, a partner at consultancy EY India. “India has a very high amount of food wastage because of lack of technology and infrastructure. So there’s a huge upside to the program.” The idea is simple: Seed all the information such as crop pattern, soil health, insurance, credit, and weather patterns into a single database and then analyze it through AI and data analytics. Then the goal is to develop personalized services for a sector replete with challenges such as peaking yields, water stress, degrading soil and lack of infrastructure including temperature-controlled warehouses and refrigerated trucks.Under the agreement, the big tech companies help the government in developing proof of concepts to offer tech solutions for farm-to-fork services, which farmers will be able to access at their doorstep. If beneficial, firms would be able to sell the final product to the government and also directly to growers and the solutions would be scaled up at the national level. So far, the government has seeded publicly available data for more than 50 million farmers of the 120 million identified land-holding growers. Some of the local companies that have signed up include Star Agribazaar Technology, ESRI India Technologies, yoga guru Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali Organic Research Institute and Ninjacart.“A database would be useful for a variety of purposes — agri-marketing, targeting of subsidies” and more, said Sanjay Mathur, chief economist for Asean and India at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “It does lead to a more efficient structure for the rural sector.”But success is far from guaranteed. The plan to rope in big corporations is already drawing fire from critics, who say the move is yet another attempt by the government to give the private sector a greater sway, a development that could hurt small and vulnerable farmers. The program may even add fuel to the protracted protests Modi’s government has been struggling to tackle for more than nine months after controversial new agricultural laws riled up some farmers. With crucial state elections due in 2022, it may get tougher to sell the technology-to-help-agriculture concept to a farming community already suspicious of the government’s intentions. “With this data they will know where the produce wasn’t good, and will buy cheap from farmers there and sell it at exorbitant prices elsewhere,” said Sukhwinder Singh Sabhra, a farmer from the northern state of Punjab, who has been protesting since November against the new farm laws. “More than the farmers it is the consumers who will suffer.” Technology adoption is still at a nascent stage in India, said Apeksha Kaushik, principal analyst at Gartner. “Limited availability of technology infrastructure and recurring natural phenomena like floods, droughts have also worked against the deployment of digital solutions,” she said.Anxiety over data privacy could be another challenge. Abhimanyu Kohar, a 27-year-old farmers’ leader, who has been supporting the protesting farmers, said it’s a “serious issue.” “We all know the record of the government in keeping the data safe,” he said. Despite the hurdles, a few one-year pro bono pilot programs are already underway.Microsoft has selected 100 villages to deploy AI and machine learning and build a platform. Amazon, which has already started offering real-time advice and information to farmers through a mobile app, is offering cloud services to solution providers. Representatives at the India offices of Microsoft and Amazon didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. Star Agribazaar, whose co-founder Amit Mundawala calls the project a “game changer,” will collect data on agri land profiling, crop estimation, soil degradation and weather patterns. ESRI India is using geographic information system to generate data and create applications, according to Managing Director Agendra Kumar. “Once you have the data, you can correlate with on-ground reality and improve your projections, take informed decisions and see which regions need policy intervention,” said PK Joshi, former director for South Asia at Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute.A similar data-driven system implemented in the southern state of Karnataka last year helped increase efficiency in delivery of government benefits, said Rajeev Chawla, the state’s additional chief secretary. Some bank loans have even been made to farmers using the centralized data, and all government programs, verification for insurance and loans and minimum support price are being routed through the mechanism, plugging leakages and eliminating frauds, he said.Besides the tech giants, many smaller companies and startups are likely to join the program. When completed the project will form the core of a national digital agriculture ecosystem to help farmers realize better profitability with access to right information at the right time, and to facilitate better planning and execution of policies, according to the government’s consultation paper on digital agriculture.“How this exercise will translate into action or lead to higher production and farm income, that remains to be seen,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings Ltd.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/amazon-microsoft-swoop-in-on-24-billion-india-farm-data-trove/articleshow/86283554.cms,0,0.0

We have done this in just two years and our renewables portfolio has reached our initial target of 25 Gigawatts (GW) a full four years ahead of schedule. This puts us well on track to be the world's largest renewable power generating company by 2030,” Adani said.“Our actions clearly indicate that we are putting our money where our mouth is: Over 75% of our planned capex until 2025 will be in green technologies. Today, of our EBITDA from utilities, 43% is already from the green business.”The group is the country’s largest private producer of power from coal-fired stations as well as renewable sources and aggressively pursuing a transition to cleaner energy. The group plans to triple renewable generation capacity over the next four years, power all data centres with renewable energy and turn its ports into net-zero by 2025.On climate change, Adani also hit out at the developed economies that are criticising the pace of India’s climate reform and pressuring New Delhi to announce a net-zero goal. “The economic and industrial might of the West sits on a carpet of carbon soot several centuries deep. A hundred years ago, today's climate reformers were burning over 800 million tonnes of coal – that is more coal than what India produces today. From pre-industrial times until now, India accounts for only 3% of the extra carbon in the atmosphere and will eventually end up consuming less than 8% of the entire remaining carbon budget,” he said.“India accounts for only 3% of the extra carbon in the atmosphere while supporting 17% of the world’s population in one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. Those criticising our reluctance to directly adopt western advice on climate change must deeply consider the disparity in the situation. It is impractical to suggest alternatives that the developing world does not have, cannot use and cannot afford,"" he said.""In my country, more than a quarter-billion households and millions of small businesses that generate jobs rely on the availability of cheaply produced electricity.

He’s now worth $100.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, after his wealth increased by $23.8 billion this year.Since inheriting the oil-refining and petrochemicals businesses of his late father’s empire in 2005, Ambani, 64, has been seeking to transform the energy giant into a retail, technology and e-commerce titan. His telecommunications unit, which started services in 2016, is now the dominant carrier in the Indian market. His retail and technology ventures raised about $27 billion last year, selling stakes to investors ranging from Facebook Inc and Google to KKR & Co and Silver Lake.<iframe title=""Ambani entered the elite club of individuals who hold fortunes in excess of $100 billion"" aria-label=""Bar Chart"" id=""datawrapper-chart-LabRW"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/LabRW/1/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""424""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>Ambani unveiled an ambitious push into green energy in June, with a planned investment of about $10 billion over three years. And last month, the mogul said his company would “aggressively” pursue production of cheaper green hydrogen. The plan aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitions of turning India into a global manufacturing hub for the cleaner fuel to combat climate change and slash energy imports by the world’s third-biggest oil consumer. While Ambani’s announcement has been viewed by some as an acknowledgment that his group needs to look beyond oil to cement its future, the fossil fuel still plays a central role at Reliance, accounting for almost 60% of its $73 billion in annual revenue. The oil-to-chemicals business is now a separate unit, and talks are under way to get Saudi Arabian Oil Co. as an investor.“Mukesh Ambani is at the forefront of creating new businesses with new emerging technologies,” said Chakri Lokapriya, chief investment officer at TCG Asset Management Co in Mumbai. “Creating businesses of scale at speed brings execution challenges, but he has demonstrated his capabilities.”The story of Reliance dates back to the late 1960s when Dhirubhai Ambani, who started out as a gas-station attendant in Yemen, began building his polyester business into a vast empire. When he died of a stroke in 2002 without leaving a will, a succession feud erupted between his two sons, Mukesh and Anil, 62, which was eventually settled by the siblings’ mother, Kokilaben, in 2005. Under the truce agreement, Mukesh got control of the flagship oil refining and petrochemicals businesses, while his younger brother got newer areas such as power generation, financial services and telecommunications services. Anil -- once a billionaire -- told a London court last year that his net worth was “zero.”India’s billionaires are some of the largest gainers on the world’s rich list, as Asia’s best-performing major stock market this year gets a boost from a surge in initial public offerings.

The meeting scheduled to be held in the second week of November is being seen as the first step in the proposed sale of Future Group’s retail, warehousing and logistics assets to Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries. Amazon, locked in a bitter legal with the Future Group, wants to block the deal. Future Retail had originally approached SIAC with two pleas. It had contented that it was not a party to the agreement signed between Future Coupons and Amazon in 2019, through which the e-tailer had pumped in around Rs 1,400 into FCPL. Secondly, FRL urged SIAC to lift the interim stay on its deal to sell its assets to Reliance Retail. Amazon claimed the investment gave it an indirect stake in the flagship Future Group company, which operates supermarket chain Big Bazaar, as FCPL owned around 10% stake in FRL. The subsequent announcement of Future Group’s proposed asset sale to Reliance, however, saw the e-tailer dragging the Big Bazaar parent to SIAC in October last year, which granted Amazon an interim award over the Future-Reliance deal. Amazon alleged that the Future Group violated contractual agreements due to the proposed deal with Reliance. A Future Group spokesperson and Amazon did not comment for this story. In a stock exchange filing, FRL said, “Further to our earlier intimation(s), we would like to inform that the advocates of the Company are in receipt of an intimation from advocates of Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC (“Amazon”) that Amazon has filed an Interim Application in the SLP (Civil) Nos. 13556-13557 of 2021 filed by the Company and pending before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/singapore-tribunal-rejects-future-retails-plea-to-lift-interim-stay-on-its-asset-sale-to-reliance-retail/articleshow/87190439.cms,2,1.5

Pvt investment at 16-year-high,"India News: This festive season may actually bring some reason to cheer. Private investment has been picking up, large new projects mean greater scope for capacit","For more than a decade now, India’s economy has struggled against a slew of challenges, from regulatory issues to corruption to rising bad debt. But this festival season may bring some light into a hitherto gloomy scenario. Domestic and global consumption seems to be picking up, which is good news for manufacturing and exports. Private investment has gone up, as have project sizes. Projects Today, a databank with information on new and ongoing projects from all sectors across India, estimates that this is the first time in 16 years that private investment has been so robust. Green shoots of recoveryEveryone, from the Prime Minister down, has been talking about the Indian economy looking up. Here are numbers that corroborate what they are saying. For the first time in 16 years – since 2006-07 when the Indian economy grew well on the back of robust exports surge – fresh investment by the private sector is reaching new peak at Rs 4,78,564 crore in the first half of 2021-22, says Shashikant Hegde, CEO, Projects Today. Over the last decade or so, India’s economy has grappled with a host of issues, including multiple scams across sectors, mired infrastructure projects, a rising NPA crisis, tightening regulatory norms, demonetisation, and teething troubles of GST implementation. Economic growth was measly, and what there was did not promote employment. All this naturally had an impact on investments in capacity expansion and greenfield projects.There are many reasons put forward for the tide now turning. Global strategic shifts, such as countries looking for viable alternatives to China, have seen multinationals reassess India as an investment destination. The government, on its part, has tried to boost manufacturing through schemes such as the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for specific sectors. The PLI scheme has resulted in healthy investments in selected sectors; EY, in a post on its site, reckons that the initial round of PLI schemes spanning mobile phones, drugs and medical devices attracted investments of over $5 billion.It’s not just increased investment; the average size of projects has also been going up. In the first half of this financial year, 70 mega private projects accounted for 43.24% of the total fresh investment announced. <iframe title=""Fresh investments by private sector increase"" aria-label=""table"" id=""datawrapper-chart-Q4J0E"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/Q4J0E/4/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""790""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>Remember, this is at a time when domestic consumption has been picking up after a blighted pandemic year. The big question to ask is will all this buoy India’s job market? The non-tech areas like manufacturing and infrastructure have traditionally absorbed millions of workers migrating from a farm to non-farm economy. If that happens, this investment can unleash a multiplier effect.While private investment has seen a marked increase, the same cannot be said of government investment which has remained low over the past few years. At Rs 2,64,246 crore in the first half of FY22, it’s almost half the peak it was in H1 FY17 when it stood at Rs 5,04,787 crore. Even the number of projects has been fewer.  <iframe title=""Fresh investments by govt low"" aria-label=""table"" id=""datawrapper-chart-RmgOQ"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/RmgOQ/2/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""790""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>Turnaround in manufacturingThe PLI scheme, which seems to have made a difference in attracting investment in manufacturing, is part of the government’s greater ‘Make In India’ push. The idea behind the PLI scheme is to scale up domestic manufacturing and encourage import substitution. It seems to be working. Investments in manufacturing have witnessed the sharpest turnaround. From a low Rs 86,168 crore in H1 FY20, it has crossed Rs 2,78,606 crore in H1 2022. Compare this with the muted investments in the infrastructure sector – from Rs 4,12,771 crore in the first half of FY20 to an even lower Rs 3,11,058 crore in H1 FY22.The pick-up in manufacturing investments is heartening; for long, experts have mourned the fact that manufacturing GDP contributed a mere 18% to India’s total GDP. Equally important, with more investments and capacity expansion in manufacturing, this sector could offer employment to a large section of the 400-million-strong workforce that is still primarily employed in the low-profit agricultural sector. However, with rapid automation and digitisation – even in the manufacturing sector – it remains to be seen what kind of jobs are created, both qualitatively and quantitatively. medium nocaption87340554States lag, MNCs push pedalAs we have seen above, the government lags in terms of investments. Analysing the investments announced by the central government and the state governments, it is clear that it’s the fund-starved state governments who have been laggards. From Rs 1,78,055 crore (2,900 projects) in H1 FY20, state investments dipped to Rs 100,859 crore (2246 projects) in H1 FY22.In contrast, in the private sector – Indian as well as MNC – increased their quantum of investments. Total investments have gone up from Rs 3,27,411 crore in H1 FY20 (1955 projects) to Rs 4,87,634 crore in H1 FY22 (2012 projects). Foreign investments have shown even sharper growth from Rs 19,379 crore (53 projects) to Rs 64,792 crore (73 projects) during the respective periods. medium nocaption87341495Private sector investments were in the areas of food processing, drugs & pharma, plastic products, electronics, automobiles, data centres and textiles. Recall that these are also the sectors in which the PLI scheme applies. Among the large projects announced in the first half of FY22 are a Rs 60,000 crore Green Energy Giga Complex of Reliance Industries; Rs 29,200 crore PVC plant of Adani Enterprises; Rs 25,000 crore wind power project of JSW Energy; Rs 18,000 crore passenger cars project of Maruti Suzuki; and Rs 15,000 crore data centre project of Microsoft Corporation (India).Unequal statesIn a country where economic growth has been unequally distributed, investment data indicate that the trend continues. The top five states by investment are Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka and Odisha. The five of them together account for half of total fresh investments announced in H1 FY22. Gujarat leads with 612 projects worth Rs 1,32,169.47 crore. It is followed by Maharashtra and Telangana with total fresh investment of Rs 1,03,106.70 crore and Rs 55,670.30 crore respectively. <iframe title=""Gujarat leads in fresh expenditure by states"" aria-label=""table"" id=""datawrapper-chart-6jJJ7"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/6jJJ7/2/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""647""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>Gujarat and Maharashtra, are also the preferred destinations of private investors and have managed to attract most of the mega projects announced in the country.

But that’s already unrealistic. With temperatures 1.1 degrees higher than in the second half of the 19th century and greenhouse gas emissions still rising, the ambitious goal adopted by 196 countries in Paris six years ago is a near-certain miss.That will no doubt lead to a new round of finger-pointing between rich and poor nations about how each side is being unreasonable and unfair. For a clue to how this depressing stalemate will ever be resolved, cast your gaze to Gujarat, where there’s no sense of defeat, or even righteous indignation about being forced to go on a low-emission diet by those who were early to industrialise.Instead, two of the world’s richest businessmen are furiously writing billion-dollar checks in their race to shape our climate future. Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani owe their fortunes to carbon, and yet it’s in hydrogen — the simplest known element — where a complex contest between them could open a pathway to decarbonised economic growth. India’s official position is that net zero emissions by 2050 is an unjust demand. Yet, the optimism of the tycoons from Gujarat offers a way out of the impasse. Betting on one or both to succeed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi might promise to do more for the climate, though real work for his team will start only after returning from Glasgow. That’s when Ambani, 64, and Adani, 59, will want supportive policies.Ambani owes his top spot on Asia’s rich list to Gujarat’s Jamnagar, host to the world’s largest oil-refining complex. It spews out spare cash to invest in retail and the internet. Pivoting away from fossil fuels, Ambani is setting up four new factories in the district, one each for solar panels, batteries, green hydrogen and fuel cells. His flagship Reliance Industries has so far spent $1.2 billion on acquisitions and partnerships, and already Bernstein analysts believe the new enterprise to be worth $36 billion, compared with $30 billion for the decades-old refining business.Before Ambani entered the green-energy race in June, Adani was winning it. For years, the Adani Group mined coal, produced coal-fired power at large plants like Mundra in Gujarat and berthed coal vessels at his vast network of ports. When Adani made news on an environmental issue, it was usually for the wrong reason. But in the past three years, the second-richest Asian has swiftly assembled a 20 gigawatt solar, wind and hybrid electricity portfolio. Adani Green Energy shares have risen 13-fold in the past 24 months, feeding the magnate’s ambition to be the world’s largest renewable energy producer by 2030.That won’t be easy now. Ambani is moving quickly to capture 100 gigawatts of solar manufacturing, or a third of India’s market, by the end of the decade. Reliance has bought Norwegian solar panel maker REC Solar Holdings AS for $771 million.The deal, according to brokerage Jefferies, comes with 446 patents and a technology that consumes 75% less power than Chinese rivals. Add that to the purchase of 40% of Sterling & Wilson Solar, a contractor with 3,000 engineering teams putting up renewable-energy farms globally, and you know that Ambani is going to make REC’s panels in Jamnagar and install them wherever the sun shines bright.But sunshine won’t power large swathes of the Indian industrial hinterland. An all-weather, all-purpose alternative to fossil fuel may need to exploit the most abundant atom in the universe — not by extracting hydrogen from methane or coal, but by using some form of renewable energy, like solar or wind, to break down water molecules. That’s where the two titans will clash next.With blockbuster commitments, both billionaires are promising to tap into India’s renewed interest in hydrogen, articulated in August under a vague National Hydrogen Mission. Each businessman, however, only controls certain pieces of the puzzle.Ambani, a huge generator of gray hydrogen — the dirty, cheaper kind produced by refineries to power their own operations and often used by other industrial firms — wants to go green. He’s seeking partners to bring viable technology to India. It’s an expensive undertaking.Currently, green hydrogen is priced between $4 and $6 per kilogram. The cost of production mainly includes capital expenditure on electrolysers — industrial-scale facilities to break down water or other electrolytes into hydrogen molecules — and electricity, which makes up around 30% to 65%. All told, green hydrogen is between two to seven times more expensive than the carbon-intensive gray kind.For hydrogen to become a real option, affordability is key. Luckily, India is a testing ground for making everything cheaper. World-beating pricing lies at the heart of the smartphone data empire Ambani has built up from scratch in six years. The country could make green hydrogen cost competitive with gray by the end of this decade, one of the fastest timelines globally, according to a BloombergNEF analysis. In a speech in September, Ambani talked up a “New Green Revolution,” saying he was sure India could produce hydrogen at “under $1 per 1 kilogram within a decade.” He called it the 1-1-1 target.Ambani’s efforts toward building electrolysers will serve the Reliance empire internally. But to run those electrolysers and make the hydrogen path green, he will need renewable energy. Power supply is where rival Adani is stronger. As one of the world’s largest solar power players, he will have plenty of green electricity. And when it’s time to move hydrogen, Adani’s dominance over transportation could come into play. Late last year, the Adani Group set up a collaboration with Snam SpA, Italy’s natural-gas distribution network.Adani, too, has talked of green hydrogen as a game-changer and wants to build electrolysers. Any plans to capture the entire hydrogen supply chain though would be misguided. Producing the gas, processing, storing and distributing it, and then putting it to use, requires varied expertise. It also needs special handling given its flammability. Rather than trying to do it all — as Adani and Ambani have said they want to — it would be more productive to focus on distinct parts of the value chain, where each billionaire has an advantage.After Ambani’s $10 billion foray into renewables in June, Adani upped the ante, saying he’ll invest twice as much. But as India’s experience with solar shows, producing electricity cheaply isn’t enough. Even with a strong policy push by the federal government, it’s a struggle to make near-bankrupt state distribution utilities honor their long-term power purchase agreements or pay on time.What’s needed is a hydrogen policy that capitalizes on the two tycoons’ eagerness to invest, but prepares the ground for an open network with strong competition that whets demand. Still, it’s unlikely that the two Gujarati entrepreneurs who have so far avoided going head-to-head will be keen to coordinate by putting their pieces of the jigsaw together.For all its potential uses and cost advantages, how Ambani and Adani duke it out on hydrogen will decide if a relatively poor, populous country can contribute to saving the planet — without surrendering its shot at better living standards. Just the question that Glasgow, like the other 25 climate summits before it, will probably fail to answer.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/a-climate-clash-between-two-billionaires-ambani-and-adani-over-hydrogen/articleshow/87467436.cms,2,2.0

His $13-billion JSW Group is the latest to announce restructuring moves after Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta and Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries (RIL). The pattern in India, dominated by conglomerates, mirrors the restructuring initiatives of global powerhouses like General Electric, Toshiba and Johnson & Johnson. Jindal’s new renewable power company will inherit all the assets and liabilities of the business and will unlock value for shareholders in the future. Vedanta plans to split into three companies, while RIL seeks to spin off its gasifier business into a separate entity. “It looks like everyone wants to emulate Adani Group stocks and also ride on the IPO craze,” said InGovern founder Shriram Subramanian. “Many of these promoters will come with OFS (offer for sale) at high valuations,” he added. Jindal targets to have a power generation capacity of 20 gigawatts by the end of this decade. Of this, he wants the share of green energy to be 85%, up from the current 30%. The new renewable power company, JSW Energy Neo, will house existing as well as upcoming units in solar, wind and hydrogen.Ahmedabad-based Adani Group had undertaken a restructuring exercise in 2015 to split ports, power, transmission, alternate energy and incubation initiatives into separate entities. Over the last six years, Adani created billions in value, said HDFC Securities research head (retail) Deepak Jasani. The latest restructuring moves by Indian conglomerates follows their recovery from a slump triggered by the pandemic. Separating the business from the main company will sharpen focus and can tailor capital according to requirements. It seems that investors no longer like diversified structures. Earlier, the thinking was that if one business is in a downcycle, then the other would make up for the contraction. There would be some amount of cross-subsidisation. Investors are now of the view that the value of the whole is less than the sum of the parts. Therefore, businesses need to be segregated, Institutional Investor Advisory Services founder Amit Tandon told a business news channel.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/jsw-follows-vedanta-rilwill-rejig-group-structure/articleshow/87918895.cms,2,2.0

I think we are on the right track,"" he said.The comments came as the government looks to bring a new bill in Parliament to treat cryptocurrencies as a financial asset while safeguarding small investors. The legislation may stipulate a minimum amount for investments in digital currencies while banning their use as legal tender.The legislative agenda for the current winter session of Parliament that started on November 29 lists bringing of a bill that seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies except ""certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses.""While the government is considering taxing gains from cryptocurrency, the Reserve Bank of India wants a complete ban on digital currencies as it feels this could affect the nation's macroeconomic and financial stability.""Data and digital infrastructure is strategically important for India and every other nation in the world. Every country has the right to build and protect this strategic digital infrastructure,"" he said adding a uniform global standard was needed so that cross-border transactions, collaborations and partnerships are not hampered.Stating that every citizen's right to privacy has to be safeguarded, he said the right policies and the right regulatory framework have to balance this with the nation's need to guard data and digital infrastructure.Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries Ltd, said that he was a big believer in blockchain technology.""I believe in blockchain technology and this is different from cryptocurrency,"" he said, adding, ""Blockchain is very important for a trust-based, equitable society.""While the bill for regulating cryptocurrency is in the works, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das is among those who feel that the blockchain technology underpinning cryptocurrencies could exist on its own, even without the currency.""Using blockchain, we can deliver unprecedented security, trust, automation and efficiency to almost any type of transaction,"" Ambani said. ""It can be used to modernize our supply chains that form the lifeblood of our economies.""India is now well on its way to transforming itself into a leading Digital Society, having put the digital infrastructure, and the regulatory framework in place.""Data is indeed the 'new oil'. But the new oil is fundamentally different from the traditional oil. Traditional oil was extracted only at select places – thus, it created wealth only for some countries. In contrast, the new oil -- that is data -- can be generated and consumed everywhere and by everybody. It has the potential to create value equitably, across sectors, across geographies, across economic classes,"" he said.His comments come against the backdrop of a debate on how India should balance user protections with support for its digital economy in the world's fastest-growing major internet market. Foreign companies and hundreds of home-grown startups have flourished amid a dearth of regulation.Ambani's Jio has supercharged internet adoption, helping crash data prices since launch in 2016, and his group has now created an online-to-offline retail platform take on the likes of Amazon and Walmart-backed Flipkart, which are both betting big on India's e-commerce market.The country, he said, is transitioning fully from 2G to 4G. ""We are in the process of creating an equally affordable ecosystem of devices to enable greater adoption, supported by a faster rollout of optical fiber, cloud, and data center infrastructure.""The next step will be the connectivity of machines, devices and vehicles, which is the Internet of Things. With 5G rollout next year in India, we are on our way to having one of the most advanced digital infrastructures anywhere in the world.""Ambani said India is well on its way to transforming itself into a leading Digital Society, having put the digital infrastructure, and the regulatory framework in place.""Finance is at the heart of everything, and I believe we are in very early stages of sporadic digitization, and with various new-age technologies emerging, the opportunity is in adopting a decentralised model of finance,"" he said.There will be centralised government and central bank policies, but there will be a path to decentralized technological solutions where finance will be enabled and available to everybody, Ambani said.Real-time technologies will help settle trades, not in days or hours, but in real-time.

Additionally, business models like Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) and Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) will be explored wherein Jio-BP could provide charging solutions to EVs made by Mahindra Group. Jio-BP recently launched its first station in Maharashtra, offering multiple fuelling choices, including EV-charging infrastructure.India’s EV market, though nascent, is red hot right now. With companies like Ola, Greaves and most recently Simple Energy setting up large e-two-wheeler plants (Ola and Simple are both million-plus factories), the supply side is ramping up fast. It’s the charging infrastructure though that’s going to be a game changer. According to a Grant Thornton Charat-Ficci report released earlier this year, the estimate was that India would need 400,000 charging stations by 2026 to accommodate 2 million EVs. According to the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles, there were around 1,800 charging stations as of March this year for just over 16,000 electric four-wheelers.88177888 Because the demand is so high, the activity is beginning to get frenetic too at the charging end. Tata Power and its leverage with Tata Motors’s EV business has been one of the reasons for the success of the latter’s EV strategy. In the two-wheeler space, Tata Power has also partnered with TVS for charging network. Ashok Leyland has signed an MoU with ABB Power Grids to set up fast-charging infrastructure for electric buses. Traditional oil companies are already ramping up their EV-charging network riding on their petrol/diesel channels. Indian Oil, which currently has 448 charging stations, plans to ramp up to 2,000 in a year and add another 8,000 in a further 2 years. In the two-wheeler space, vehicle manufacturers are setting up their own network, taking a leaf out of the dealer-channel build that ICE OEMs do. Ola, for instance, is investing heavily in its hyper charger network and has announced it will have 100,000 charging points across 400 cities. Rival Hero Electric has announced it will set up 10,000 charging stations by 2022.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mm-jio-bp-tie-up-for-ev-services/articleshow/88173368.cms,2,2.0

The conglomerate aims to get about a 500,000 barrels cargo of United Arab Emirates' Das crude from RINL, said the source, who is not authorised to speak to media.Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), which has leased part of the strategic petroleum reserve at Mangalore in southern India, supplied 1 million barrels of Das crude from the cavern to Reliance in October and 2 million barrels in November, data from trade sources show.India has allowed ADNOC to trade oil from the cavern.This month, Indian refiners are snapping up February-loading Middle Eastern sour crude after spot premiums halved from the multi-month highs seen for January-lifting cargoes, trade sources said.There are more supplies from the Atlantic Basin, while the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, decided earlier this month to continue increasing output by 400,000 barrels per day in January.Reliance has bought 4 million barrels of Das crude for February loading at premiums of about $2 to $2.30 a barrel to Dubai quotes, trade sources said, down from premiums of more than $5 in the previous month.Italy's Eni is supplying 1.5 million barrels, while PetroChina has sold 1 million barrels, they said.

Kanubhai Desai, state finance and education minister when contacted confirmed the plans for bringing new green hydrogen energy policy. “Globally green hydrogen energy generation is being seen as the answer to climate change mitigation,” he said. In his latest Independence Day speech on August 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had stressed upon the importance of India to transform into a hydrogen-based economy while flagging the launch of the National Hydrogen Mission. Many companies have started making the switch as a result. Some of the companies that have started work in this direction include Reliance Industries Ltd, Adani group, L&T, NTPC, GAIL and IOC, among others.The government aims to offer major financial incentives for research & development and human resources incentives also.

The negative sentiments caused by the global sell-off triggered by the explosive growth of the Omicron variant may persist in the short run. Sustained FII selling (above Rs 30,000 crore for December, so far) continues to be a major headwind for the market, said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. However, it is important to note that FIIs are booking profits rather than selling indiscriminately in India. From November 1st to 15th December FIIs sold bank stocks worth Rs 19,442 crore. They have been sitting on big profits on bank stocks, which they accumulated during 2015-20. So, profit booking makes sense, he stated.

The 6.59% yield on the 10-year bond is the highest since January 31, 2020. The benchmark 10-year bond had closed at 6.54% on Friday. Sentiment in the bond market has changed after the RBI became a net seller of bonds — a move seen aimed at supporting measures to normalise the excess liquidity pumped in to help markets during the pandemic. Bond yields rose ahead of December inflation numbers, which are expected on Wednesday. Dealers also have a negative outlook on inflation with global oil prices firming up over concerns of supply constraints because of geopolitical tension in Libya and Kazakhstan. Additionally, bond yields rose because of a surge in US yields. A drop in unemployment in the US is expected to prompt the Federal Reserve to hike rates earlier than expected.In domestic market, the sensex opened stronger. Bank stocks were among key gainers.

Future denies any wrongdoing.Future told exchanges this month it was unable to pay Rs 3,500 crore ($470 million) it owed to its lenders on December 31 as it could not sell certain small stores due to the dispute with Amazon. It had hoped to use a 30-day grace period to resolve the situation.Beyond that, banks are bound by law to classify Future's accounts as a ""non-performing asset"", or an NPA, and declare it as a defaulter, further complicating the financial position of the debt-laden company.The sources said Future was readying an approach to the Supreme Court within days to urge judges to stop its lenders from taking any drastic steps and extend timelines to allow it to sell its small stores and clear its dues.Future's 1,700 outlets include roughly 900 small-sized stores, with the rest being large-format hypermarkets and fashion outlets.Further, Future is also likely to ask judges to direct the country's central bank to extend the 30-day regulatory grace period and ask the lenders to not declare it as an NPA for the time being, one of the sources said.The sources declined to be identified as the plans are not public. The lead bankers to Future, State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Bank of India, and the RBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Future also did not respond.Future's plans signal growing distress at the retail group, which has said it fears liquidation and more than 27,000 job losses at its main retail arm, Future Retail, if its asset sale plan to rival Reliance Industries fails.One banker who has exposure to Future said lenders will be forced to make financial provisions in their books in line with regulations if Future does not pay up by the end of January, unless there ""is a legal angle and a court gives an order to put a hold on it.""Amazon has long argued that Future violated the terms of a 2019 deal they had signed when the US firm invested $200 million in a Future unit.

The company's net profit came in at Rs 18,549 crore as compared to a profit of Rs 13,101 crore posted in same period last year. RIL's strong performance has been majorly boosted mainly by its refining and retail business segment.It operates four business verticals -- the oil-to-chemical (or O2C) business includes its oil refineries, petrochemical plants, and fuel retailing business; retail business that houses brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce; digital services that cover telecom arm Jio; and new energy business.Three-fourths of the incremental EBITDA came from O2C and oil and gas business on the back of higher prices and demand returning with bouncing back of economy.O2C segment's operating profit rose sequentially for the sixth straight quarter, aided by improved refining margins and prices. EBITDA at Rs 13,530 crore was up 6.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter and 38.7 per cent year-on-year.Consolidated revenue of the nation's biggest company by market value rose 9.5 per cent over the previous three months and 52.2 per cent year-on-year to Rs 209,823 crore. In terms of quarter-on-quarter growth, RIL's profit jumped 35.59 per cent from Rs 13,680 crore posted in previous quarter ending September 2021. The company's revenue from operations came in at Rs 1.91 lakh crore in the period under consideration from Rs 1.24 lakh crore a year back. Reliance's retail business rode a boom in consumer demand, with the lifting of most Covid-19 restrictions toward the end of 2021, while higher refining margins and improved price realizations bolstered its mainstay energy business.Reliance recorded a one-off gain of Rs 2,872 crore from the sale of its shale gas assets.""Retail business activity has normalized with strong growth in key consumption baskets on the back of festive season and as lockdowns eased across the country,"" Ambani said in a statement.""The recovery in global oil and energy markets supported strong fuel margins and helped our O2C (oil-to-chemicals)business deliver robust earnings.""RIL's telecom arm Jio Infocomm post nearly 10 per cent jump in profit at Rs 3,615 crore as against Rs 3,291 crore posted in same quarter last year.Jio's subscriber base grew, helped by its budget smartphone Jiophone Next.

Net profit from retail business rose 23.4 per cent to Rs 2,259 crore.The growth was supported by retail demand in jewellery, electronics and grocery. Also, lower restrictions on mobility and higher operating days during the quarter were other drivers of the retail segment's sales.It opened 837 new stores during the quarter, taking the total count to 14,412 stores.

This is because there were still some pandemic-related restrictions in some regions of the country in 1HFY22.""We expect the recovery to continue through to 4QFY22, subject to the risk of a resurgence in Covid-19 cases and the resultant impact on economic activity and mobility,"" it said.In its 'India Oil & Gas Watch' report, the rating agency said capex is likely to stay high as oil marketing companies (OMCs) expand their refining capacity and retail networks, and upstream companies enhance production.""We expect stable crude oil production, which should marginally increase in FY23 as upstream producers continue to invest in exploration and development,"" it said.India's natural gas production increased by 22% yoy in April-December 2021 and the momentum is likely to continue over the next 12-18 months, driven by expanded production at new fields, before stabilising in FY23.""We believe rising domestic production and higher liquefied natural gas (LNG) spot prices are likely to weigh on LNG imports through to 1HFY23. However, LNG imports should rise steadily over the medium-term as consumption picks up pace,"" it said.Core oil refining margins are likely to improve in 2HFY22 (October 2021 to March 2022), as petrol and diesel spreads continue to strengthen amid the economic recovery. The 1HFY22 (April-September 2021) reported margins of BPCL, IOC and HPCL improved to $5.1 per barrel, $6.6 and $2.9 a barrel, respectively, on account of rebounding demand, wider gasoline spreads and inventory gains.""We expect the OMCs to generate steady marketing margins in 2HFY22, as they continue to pass on higher crude oil prices to consumers,"" Fitch said.""Government cuts to gasoline (petrol) and gasoil (diesel) excise duties, as well as to value-added tax in some states, should cushion retail fuel-price affordability and the OMCs' marketing margins.""However, record-high retail fuel prices may limit the extent to which the changes are passed on should the crude oil prices continue to rise, it said.India's crude oil production declined by 3% year-on-year in April-December 2021, while natural gas production rose by 22%.The steep rise in gas output was due to a production ramp-up at the KG-DWN-98/2 and KG-D6 deepwater projects. Natural gas production to further increase over the next 12-18 months, driven by expanding production at the new fields, before stabilising in FY23.""Crude oil production should stay stable in 4QFY22, before marginally increasing as upstream producers continue to invest in exploration and development and enhance existing facilities to offset the natural decline from mature fields,"" Fitch said.The government increased the domestic gas price at the last October 2021-March 2022 reset to $2.9 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), from an all-time low of $1.8 in April 2021-September 2021.The price is linked to prices of four global liquefied natural gas (LNG) benchmarks, including Henry Hub and National Balancing Point, in the previous 12 months and is implemented with a quarter's lag.Global gas prices rose during 2021 and we expect global prices to stay high in 1Q22, driven by high demand in Asia, production bottlenecks and uncertainty around Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline as well as limited gas in European storage facilities.This is likely to result in higher domestic gas prices during 1HFY23, helping boost profitability at upstream companies. However, the impact on upstream companies will be marginal, due to its low share in the revenue mix, Fitch said.The government's higher price ceiling for gas produced from deepwater and other difficult fields of $6.13 per mmBtu, from $3.62, is likely to benefit production at Reliance Industries Ltd's Krishna Godavari basin field.

However, some buying at lower levels in the closing hour helped the index to close at 57,492, down 1,546 points on the day. A rumour about a hike in long term capital gains tax rate in the Budget, which was later denied by the government, also added to investors' nervousness, market players said.In the last five sessions, the sensex has lost nearly 4,000 points, from its recent closing high at 61,309 on January 17. One of the main reasons for this slide is the selling by select foreign funds, market players said.89105419 If interest rates in the world's leading economies go up to rein in inflation, that would make getting money expensive and hence these fund managers are taking some money off risky emerging markets, including India, analysts said.Recent data bolsters this logic. Monday's selling was led by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) with a net outflow at Rs 3,752 crore, that took the month's net withdrawal figure to about Rs 15,000 crore or $2 billion, BSE and CDSL data showed.Institutional sales people, who interact with foreign and domestic fund managers on a daily basis on behalf of brokers, said that a large part of the current selling is by hedge funds and ETFs while long-term investors like insurance companies and pension funds are not bearish on India, and hence not selling aggressively.The day's selling left investors poorer by nearly Rs 9 lakh crore with BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 264 lakh crore. On a year-to-date basis, investors are poorer by Rs 5.3 lakh crore, official data showed.Despite the sharp sell-off, there are analysts who are assuring investors that the current sell-off is expected to ebb in the next two-three sessions. According to Harendra Kumar, MD, Elara Securities India, in December the sensex had seen a low at below 56k mark and we are yet to reach there. ""Yet, investors are much nervous now mainly because there is a shift in investors' preference from growth stocks to value stocks,"" he said.What this means is that investors globally, including in India, are shifting from those companies with high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to reasonably lower P/E numbers. In India, stocks like Zomato and PayTM are growth stocks while companies like Reliance Industries, Maruti, ICICI Bank, etc, are value stocks. ""There is a perceptible shift in investor preference"" from growth to value stocks, he said. ""The going for the high P/E stocks in the short run would be slightly challenging.""Market players also said that compared to in the US where technology stocks have a huge weight in the indices and are being hammered, in India, similar tech-enabled companies have almost no weight in leading indices. Hence, investors should not panic and sell every profit-making stock, irrespective of the industry they belong to. On Monday evening, the leading indices in the US were hammered again with the Nasdaq composite index down over 3% in mid-session, while Dow Jones index was down 2% and S&P 500 2.6%.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-dives-1-5k-pts-on-selling-by-foreign-funds/articleshow/89102553.cms,1,1.0

The country, which has an ambitious plan of generating 280 gigawatts of sun-fired electricity by 2030, imports nearly 80 per cent of the components for solar power from China. New funding adds to an earlier package of 45 billion rupees in incentives, which helped lure companies, including Reliance Industries Ltd and Adani Group, to the sector. India’s dependence on Chinese imports extends across the entire energy sector and the nation has taken a raft of measures to curb imports from its neighbour as relations have soured over fears of cyber-attacks, border conflicts and pandemic-related supply disruptions. Power minister Raj Kumar Singh last week raised new concerns when discussing plans for local manufacturing of smart meters. The nation doesn’t want to “buy anything from our northern neighbour,” he said. Adding production in clean energy technologies “opens up huge employment opportunities and will take the country on a sustainable development path,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said Tuesday while presenting the nation’s budget. The new policy will help boost India’s self-sufficiency in solar modules and open up export opportunities, according to credit assessor Crisil Ltd. Incentives will potentially help create 30 to 35 gigawatts of solar module capacity and as much as 30 gigawatts of cell capacity by 2024, Crisil said in a tweet.Along with more aid for solar module makers, India will encourage the use of biomass pellets as fuel in thermal power plants, Sitharaman said.

The policy will initially focus on battery swap services for electric scooters, motorcycles and three-wheeled auto rickshaws, the official said, in a boost for sectors like last-mile delivery and ride-sharing.  India said on Tuesday it will introduce a new policy to promote swapping, a service that allows EV drivers to replace depleted battery blocks for freshly charged ones at swap stations. This is faster than charging the vehicle and reduces range anxiety for drivers. A battery is also the most expensive part in an EV and swapping allows companies to offer it as a service through lease or subscription models, bringing down the cost of owning and operating the vehicle, industry executives say. The government is likely to offer EV owners an incentive of up to 20% of the total subscription or lease cost of the battery and this will be in addition to what they already get for buying clean vehicles, the person said. In 2019, India set aside 100 billion rupees ($1.3 billion) to promote EVs by giving incentives directly to buyers, but only about 10% of this has been used. Incentives for battery swapping will likely be given from the same fund, the official said. Globally, battery swapping has been slow to gain traction especially among carmakers. Tesla Inc, years ago, tested the model and decided not to offer it to customers but rival Nio Inc offers swap services across China. Last month, Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology announced plans to launch swap stations. In India, oil giant Reliance Industries has formed a joint venture with Britain's BP Plc to offer battery swapping. Motorbike maker Hero MotoCorp and Taiwan's Gogoro have also partnered to set up swap stations, and the service is offered by start-up Sun Mobility as well.  The government will also define battery design and charging standards for companies that want to set up swap stations. This is to ensure the batteries can be used across EV models of different automakers, the official said.  ""The idea is that if one company sets up a battery swap station, vehicles of another company should be able to use the same battery and service. Disruption will only come with scale,"" the person said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/cars/india-close-to-finalising-incentives-under-new-battery-swap-scheme-source/articleshow/89330568.cms,2,2.0

Adding 'V' of $1, the minimum price comes to $14 per mmBtu.The sale price will be higher of the bid price or the government-approved rate for domestic gas, NIO said.The government dictated price for gas produced by state-owned firms such as ONGC presently is $2.90 per mmBtu.The rate Reliance is seeking is higher than the price at which the company had sold the same gas last year.Gas will be delivered at Shahdol in Madhya Pradesh, which is connected to the nationwide gas pipeline network through the HVJ pipeline, the NIO said.Last year, Reliance had sold three-fourths of the gas from the same CBM block to an affiliate of the company. India Gas Solutions Private Limited, a 50:50 joint venture of Reliance and UK's bp, bought 0.62 mmscmd out of 0.82 mmscmd gas bid out in that auction.State-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd cornered 0.17 mmscmd while 0.03 mmscmd was picked by Reliance Gas Pipeline - the entity that transports gas from the CBM blocks in Madhya Pradesh to consumers.The price bid was 9.2 per cent of the prevailing rate of Brent crude oil price, which translated into a rate of $8.5 per mmBtu at current oil prices.In the last year's auction, Reliance had sought bids for 0.82 mmscmd. Bids were initially sought at 9.5 per cent of Brent rate as the base or minimum price and asked bidders to ""enter bids that are higher than or equal to it."" It later lowered the base price to 8.7 per cent of Brent.At the current $92.5 per barrel Brent crude oil price, the price of gas produced from coal seams, called CBM, comes to $8.5 per mmBtu.Reliance started commercial gas production from the CBM blocks in March 2017 and reached a peak of 3 mmscmd before the end of 2018.CBM is natural gas stored or absorbed in coal seams and contains 90-95 per cent methane.The pricing formula used last year and this year is a variation over the 2017 formula when Reliance had sought bids in the form of a deductible from 12.67 per cent of prevailing Brent crude oil price plus $0.52 per mmBtu plus $0.26 per mmBtu.In that bidding for up to 3 mmscmd of gas, Reliance had outbid rivals including GAIL to buy the entire volume.Last year, Reliance and its partner BP plc of UK bid out 7.5 mmscmd of gas from its eastern offshore KG-D6 block by pricing the fuel at JKM (Japan Korea Marker).The JKM represents the price for spot LNG delivered in the Asian market and is now being widely used in the LNG industry as a marker for medium/long-term LNG contracts instead of traditional linkage to oil.

LIC is keeping aside 35% of the offering, or nearly 11.1 crore shares, for retail investors, the draft prospectus showed.Earlier, the insurer had also said that it would reserve a portion of the IPO for its policyholders, but the exact number under this category was yet to be finalised and hence not disclosed in the prospectus. LIC has not disclosed the discount it will give to policyholders, LIC employees and retail investors in the IPO.In the Budget speech this year, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the LIC IPO would be completed before the end of the fiscal. It means one of the world’s largest insurers by net premium earned will be listed before March 31 this year. Once listed, LIC is expected to become one of the most-valued companies in India.In the run-up to filing of the prospectus, government sources had told TOI it was looking at a market valuation of around Rs 15 lakh crore for LIC. To get that valuation, the IPO will need to be priced at around Rs 2,370 per share while for a valuation of Rs 16 lakh crore the offer price should be around Rs 2,530. And, for a valuation of Rs 13 lakh crore it should be around Rs 2,060 per share, calculations showed.Currently, Reliance Industries, with a market capitalisation of Rs 16.1 lakh crore, is India’s most valued company, while TCS is at number two with a market value of Rs 13.7 lakh crore, BSE data showed.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/govt-to-sell-5-lic-stake-in-indias-biggest-ever-ipo/articleshow/89553062.cms,2,2.0

They can also buy green power from exchanges. In both cases, inter-state transmission will be free when the power is used for producing green hydrogen. The government will also allow the green hydrogen/ammonia manufacturers to bank unconsumed renewable power, for up to 30 days, with distribution companies and take it back when required.The transmission charge waiver will be available for projects commissioned by June 30, 2025 and the link to the grid will be provided on priority.Since the announcement of a hydrogen mission in the 2021 Budget, several companies such as including Reliance Industries Ltd, the Adani Group, ACME Group, state-run IndianOil and GAIL have announced green hydrogen plans.“Government has tried to address some of the key demands of the industry in terms of open access, grid banking and faster approvals for green hydrogen and ammonia projects. The provisions to set up bunkers near ports for the export of green ammonia is especially welcome,” ACME group chairman Manoj K Upadhyay said.He said it will be important to build upon the first phase with mandatory green hydrogen and ammonia purchase obligations for creating the initial demand. “At the same time, an equivalent of PLI scheme for green ammonia is desirable to make India competitive globally.”ACME has set up its first green hydrogen plant in Rajasthan and investing upto $5 billion in a large place in Oman.Industries such as oil refineries and steel plants consume hydrogen, which they produce from natural gas or naphtha. While hydrogen per se is carbon-free, the use of fossil fuels results in carbon emissions.Green hydrogen is produced by electrolysing water using green power. When green hydrogen is used, it emits oxygen, which can be filled in cylinders for supplying to hospitals or other industries.

But bargain hunting later in the session helped the index recover some ground. With strong buying emerging in Reliance Industries and Tata Steel in late trades, the sensex finally closed with a 778-point loss at 55,469, while on the NSE the Nifty closed 188 points down at 16,606.Investors are jittery due to the worsening situation in the Russia-Ukraine war and rising oil prices when the rupee is also showing weakness. On the domestic front, the government’s indications that the much-awaited IPO for LIC may be delayed weighed on sentiment too, market players said. Wednesday’s selling in the stock market was led by foreign funds, as has been the case for the last few months. During the day, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers at Rs 4,339 crore, while domestic institutional investors, or DIIs were net buyers at Rs 3,062 crore, BSE data showed.According to Emkay Global Financial Services head (sales) S Hariharan, FPI flows have decisively turned negative in the current year with net outflow at around $9 billion. Historically, DIIs have absorbed selling by FPIs with a similar quantum of deployment. But it has also been observed that weak price action, as a result of foreign fund selling, is followed by outflows from DIIs as well. “As a result, the flow picture looks quite adverse despite the recent 10% correction in the Nifty,” Hariharan wrote in a note to clients.The current selloff has also led to higher volatility with the India VIX, which measures this, now hovering at 30 — up around 50% from about a month ago. According to Religare Broking VP (research) Ajit Mishra, markets have been gradually inching lower amid erratic intraday swings, but the dent is more severe on the broader front. “We feel the volatility is here to stay and the scheduled weekly expiry would further add to choppiness on Thursday.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-dives-778-pts-as-crude-surges-fpis-sell/articleshow/89956453.cms,1,1.0

In intraday trades, the index had dipped below the 55k mark for a brief while.

Since recording an all-time peak at Rs 283.2 lakh crore on January 17 this year, investors’ wealth is now down by nearly Rs 40 lakh crore or about $500 billion, official data showed.Despite sharp sell-off in recent weeks and a grim short-term outlook, fund managers are telling investors to not react in a haste and liquidate their holdings in stocks. “History is replete with several instances where investors who have stayed focused on long-term compounding from equity returns and investment objectives based on individual risk-reward profiles, have significantly benefited by taking advantage of such steep market corrections,” said Taher Badshah, CIO, Invesco Mutual Fund. “We reckon the present situation is another such occasion.”Market players also pointed out that despite the general sell-off, stocks from some sectors like metals and commodities are rallying. BSE data showed stocks like Coal India, Tata Steel Hindalco, ONGC and several other stocks have gained up to 26% since February 26, the day Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.

Not only has he jolted the US giant in the ,"NEW DELHI: Amazon has been added to the list of companies that have been outmaneuvered by Mukesh Ambani’s juggernaut. Not only has he jolted the US giant in the fight to dominate India’s retail sector, he now holds all the cards in a $3.4 billion dogfight to buy a local cash-strapped retailer.In late February, Reliance Industries quietly began poaching employees and taking over rental leases of hundreds of stores once run by Future Retail and Future Lifestyle Fashions, even as Amazon furiously tried to block formal acquisitions through lawsuits and arbitration across India and Singapore. Ambani’s bloodless coup forced Amazon to seek settlement on the bitter dispute and alarmed Future’s investors and lenders wary of asset-stripping.“We did not expect Reliance Group to take such drastic actions, without even discussing the matter with us,” Future Retail’s chief financial officer (CFO) Chandra Prakash Toshniwal wrote in a March 2 letter to Reliance’s retail units. “Please confirm that there will not be any reduction in consideration payable.”Another letter, dated March 5 -- Bloomberg has copies of both the letters -- sent by Future Lifestyle expressed “concerns and shock” and requested Reliance not to undertake such actions that “may be viewed seriously by the Lenders, who have charge on all current and fixed assets” of the company. Banks may cut off Future’s credit lines, crippling what’s left of an already cash-starved retailer, the letter said.The Kishore Biyani-led Future Group got caught in the tussle between two large corporations after Amazon objected to Reliance’s August 2020 offer to buy Future Retail’s stores and warehouses for Rs 24710 crore ($3.4 billion). The American e-commerce giant said the deal violated its 2019 agreement with another Future Group firm as it bled out Future Retail, which has missed debt obligations and faces bankruptcy risk.Future Retail said in an exchange filing late Wednesday it has received termination notices on sub-leases for 342 large and and 493 small stores from the Reliance group. These stores contributed as much as 65% of revenues but are currently not operational for stock and inventory reconciliation. Separately, Future Lifestyle has received termination notices for 112 sub-leased properties from Reliance entities that were bringing in a similar proportion of revenues.Future Group ran India's biggest retail grocery chain before the pandemic struck, making it a juicy target for two of the world’s richest men -- Ambani and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos -- as they jostle for control of the only billion-plus consumer market where foreign firms can compete.Representatives for Reliance, Amazon and the Future Group didn’t immediately respond to emailed queries seeking comments on the letters. The fate of Future Group investors, including Blackstone and L Catterton, and lenders now hang in balance as Reliance, Future and Amazon hammer out an out-of-court settlement by March 15, when they need to report progress to Supreme Court. Reliance’s tactical win offers it the “master key,” giving it the strongest position at the negotiation table, according to Nirmal Gangwal, Mumbai-based founder of financial advisory firm Brescon & Allied Partners LLP.Amazon is the latest player to witness how the Reliance conglomerate muscles in and eventually dominates nearly every sector it gets into -- petrochemicals, crude oil refining, consumer retail, telecom, digital services and, more recently, green energy.Tacit takeoverLast week, Amazon sought to bury a nearly two-year-old legal spat, five days after local media reported Reliance’s tacit takeover of stores by signing new lease agreements with landlords owning Future’s stores and sending job offers to 30,000 workers from the Future Group. Amazon’s disbelief at the turn of events came through during court hearing last week. The American e-tailer’s lawyer Gopal Subramanium said Future Group told them the deal with Reliance will take six months or more to close. “It has hardly been 48 hours and people are taking over shops,” he said.But the drawn-out litigation hurt Future Group the most. The two Future firms owe 300 billion rupees in total debt, on the back of dwindling cash flows and operations.Reliance will honor the definitive agreement they signed in the past, a person close to the development said, who did not want to be identified as the matter is private. It has also extended the period for closing the transaction by six months to September 30. Treading carefullyAnother person familiar with the developments said Future Group was treading carefully as it doesn’t want to unsettle Reliance right now.That tone of measured caution, bordering on desperation, comes through in the letters sent by Future firms.“We have always acted with full transparency and have considered Reliance Group as a partner,” Future Retail said in the letter, adding that it was hopeful of closing the transaction soon. “We would, therefore, request that you do not take any actions against us.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-mukesh-ambani-outfoxed-amazon-in-a-3-4-billion-deal-dispute/articleshow/90125112.cms,1,1.0

Thursday’s 817-point surge was the biggest gain for the sensex following any state election results.The rally had started on Tuesday after exit polls the previous evening indicated strong gains for the BJP and the upswing gathered momentum on Wednesday. In last three sessions, the sensex has added a little over 2,600 points, or nearly 5%, since closing at a seven-month low of 52,843 on Monday, mainly because of uncertainties relating to the Ukraine war.At close of Thursday’s session, the sensex was up 817 points, or 1.5%, at 55,464. The Nifty on the NSE was up 250 points, also 1.5%, at 16,595. The rupee too gained by 26 paise to end at 76.31 to the dollar.According to Aishvarya Dadheech, fund manager at Ambit Asset Management, the strong performance by the BJP in the state elections provided a much-needed support to the market. “State elections’ outcome took away the political instability risk in India for at least two years,” Dadheech wrote in a note.In Thursday’s session, Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and Hindustan Unilever accounted for most of the day’s gains. On the other hand, technology stocks witnessed some selling pressure, BSE data showed. The day’s gains, however, came despite foreign fund selling. End-of-the-session data on the BSE showed that foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers at Rs 1,981 crore. Domestic funds, on the other hand, were net buyers at Rs 946 crore.Brokers believe the state poll results are unlikely to impact the market’s direction in a major way. Investors’ focus will now shift towards “how policymakers minimise the economic cost of the geopolitical quagmire”, a report by Emkay Global noted. According to Dadheech, investors still need to be vigilant because the uncertainty of the geopolitical standoff looms large. “Commodity prices are least likely to see a secular downturn even after war subsides because sanctions will continue to disrupt the global supply chain. Unless sanctions are withdrawn, the global markets can remain volatile.”Friday’s market is also expected to be impacted by the US market that showed a weak trend early in Thursday’s session, mainly because retail inflation for February in the world’s largest economy was 7.9% — the highest reading in over 40 years.

This is because private-sector lenders HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, which were planning to hold a big chunk of IDRCL’s capital, are classified as foreign entities under the law and need to get permission from the government for the investment.The bad bank proposal, announced in the February 2021 Budget, envisaged a public sector National Asset Reconstruction Co (NARCL) that will acquire bad loans from banks. Once these loans were aggregated from multiple lenders, they would be resolved with private sector expertise from the IDRCL.In January 2021, SBI chairman Dinesh Khara had announced that the NARCL had received all approvals to start operations and that loans worth Rs 50,000 crore would be transferred to the NARCL by March 2022. However, the second leg of the resolution would require the IDRCL to be in place.While the RBI has granted permission to the private banks to invest in IDRCL, foreign investment norms require them to get a government nod as well. All three private banks are predominantly owned by foreign investors.Meanwhile, PSU banks have ensured that IDRCL is incorporated by making the initial investment. Earlier this month IDBI Bank, which is now a private bank, said it will invest Rs 272 crore by way of equity and debt in IDRCL. It said that by end of March, its stake would be 9%.Last week, UCO Bank said that it was acquiring a 3% stake in IDRCL for Rs 1.5 crore. The bank had indicated that it will complete the transaction this month. In February, Bank of Baroda said that it has subscribed to 99,000 shares amounting to a 12.3% stake in the company, which would come down to 9.9% by end of March 2022.For banks, it is a race against time for the transfer of loans to the bad bank. Since most of the loans are provided for, any recovery would go towards profits. The fact that the security receipts are guaranteed by the government would help release capital for the banks. In the earlier quarters, there have been large recoveries almost every quarter, which has added to the bottom line of lenders. The fourth quarter has not seen any major recovery. Banks are hopeful of recovering Rs 3,600 crore on their loans to Sintex Industries following Reliance Industries being declared the highest bidder. However, the consummation of the deal might slip into the next financial year. The rise in bond yields following the war in Ukraine would mean that treasury earnings will not be there in the fourth quarter and banks may instead have to make provisions if yields remain high.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/foreign-pvt-banks-need-govt-nod-to-back-debt-recast-firm/articleshow/90189808.cms,1,0.5

Amazon has been contesting the planned $3.4 billion sale of Future Group's retail assets to Reliance, first announced in 2020, and the case is currently before the Supreme Court.  Reliance, the country's biggest conglomerate and retailer, began taking over the prized real estate with utmost stealth on Feb.25 when its staff showed up at many of Future biggest stores to assume control, sources have told Reuters. In ads headlined ""PUBLIC NOTICE"" in leading newspapers on Tuesday, Amazon said: ""these actions have been done in a clandestine manner by playing a fraud on the constitutional courts in India."" Future and Reliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Amazon's public outcry comes even though on March 3 it offered to hold talks. The ongoing talks have raised hopes the dispute could be resolved. Future has said in filings this month that it could not pay rent at many outlets given its distressed financial situation and that Reliance, which had taken over many of its leases, had issued it with termination notices. Amazon is concerned that Reliance is continuing to take over Future stores even as the talks continue, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified. The newspaper ads were aimed at alerting all stakeholders, including Future's lenders, that the transfer of assets to Reliance is legally prohibited, the source added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/amazon-slams-reliance-takeover-of-future-stores-as-fraud-in-newspaper-ads/articleshow/90215787.cms,1,0.5

Reliance Retail has made the investment in the form of secondary share purchase and primary capital infusion. Clovia’s founding team and management will own the remaining 11% stake in the eight-year-old company. Clovia was started by Neha Kant, Pankaj Vermani and Suman Chowdhury and had elevated Soumya Kant and Abhay Batra to co-founders.It had raised about $26 million (Rs 196 crore) before Reliance Retail’s investment, according to researcher Tracxn. Clovia is Reliance Retail’s third M&A in the innerwear segment after Zivame and Amante. It had acquired Zivame in February 2021 and nine months later snapped up Amante. It has the India franchise rights of Dutch lingerie brand Hunkemoller and sells Marks & Spencer’s innerwear through a JV with the British retailer. Besides intimate wear, Clovia is into lounge wear and personal care products. It offers over 3,500 styles and follows an asset-light outsourced production model. “We will benefit from Reliance Retail’s scale and expertise, extending the presence of the brand and bring together stronger value proposition through quality, design and fashion in the intimate wear category,” said Clovia co-founder and CEO Vermani.

According to officials, the land on which the Global City project is set to come up is a part of an area that had been transferred to Reliance Industries in 2006 to be developed as a special economic zone (SEZ). After Reliance backed out of the project in 2014, it subsequently returned to the government.In 2016, the government announced that the Global City will be jointly developed by a Japanese firm and the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (DMICDC). It, too, failed to take off due to differences between DMICDC and HSIIDC, which owns the land.In 2019, the government finally designated the land as a ‘special zone’ allowing mixed land use to develop residential, commercial and recreational facilities alongside.Before the conference, Khattar is also set to inaugurate the newly constructed underpass, flyover and foot overbridges (FoB) near Huda City Centre metro station. The project has been completed at the cost of Rs 52.52 crore by the GMDA to decongest the area around the metro station. Under this project, a 750-metre-long four-lane underpass and a flyover near the metro station and two FOBs at Signature Tower and IFFCO Chowk have been constructed.The CM will also inaugurate an 8,429-metre-long water supply line for Sectors 111to 115, installed at the cost of Rs 10.1 crore.The department of town and country planning had issued licences to 33 real estate projects in this area, of these occupation certificates have been issued to 12 projects. At present, around 93,000 people live in this area and they are dependent on water tankers for their daily needs of water. The pipeline will supply around 3 MGD (million gallons per day) to the area.“The quality of water is so good that residents do not need to use RO provided society has clean water storage facilities,” a GMDA official said.Khattar is also scheduled to also participate in the ‘Pariksha pe Charcha’ programme with the students at a government school in Sector 43.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/khattar-to-hold-round-table-meet-on-global-city-project/articleshow/90579027.cms,2,2.0

The increase will also be reflected in the escalation in other costs related to transportation and insurance.Domestically produced gas is supplied on a priority basis to certain sectors, with power producers consuming 30 per cent, the fertiliser sector around 27 per cent and city-gas distributors 19 per cent in FY21.""The gas price increase will hit the fertiliser sector's profitability by increasing working-capital requirements, which is also facing higher import costs due to rising crude oil prices.""Auto gas fuel prices may be increased but should remain competitive against liquid fuels, albeit with a reduced differential as liquid auto fuel prices also rise with increasing crude oil prices. The cost of power generated by gas-based power plants will increase, further affecting their utilisation,"" Fitch added.

Mumbai-based Tata Digital Pvt.’s digital services platform, Tata Neu, which will go live to consumers on Thursday, will have in-house brands including Croma, Westside, AirAsia India, the Taj chain of luxury hotels and BigBasket, according to the group’s website. Described as a “super-app” and in the pipeline since at least mid-2020, the website called it “a unified platform that connects several brands across the Tata universe like never before.” The 154-year-old Tata group, which makes luxury cars, trucks, air conditioners, smart watches, tea besides operating luxury hotels, airlines, utilities, departmental stores and the local Starbucks Corp. franchise, wants to leverage the diversity of its products and services to lure buyers in a country of almost 1.4 billion people, who are increasingly shopping online.

The carbon savings on these are to offset emissions from oil and chemical businesses.In an April 10 note, Goldman Sachs said Reliance is adopting a manufacturing approach to net zero emissions with a hyper integrated model spanning solar, battery and hydrogen and a focus on a net-zero supply chain.""RIL's energy business is best in class, in our view, with the highest complexity globally and the lowest cost structure driving stable and higher margin capture versus peers,"" it said.This helps the firm to earn higher refining margins over the industry benchmark.""Alongside refining, we also expect (oil and gas) exploration and production (E&P) to drive the next leg of growth for the energy segment, as we estimate E&P EBITDA of $2-2.6 billion in FY23/24 versus $35 million in FY21 driven by rising domestic gas production and more than doubling of domestic gas prices,"" it said.While for petchem, margins are expected to trough in the current quarter and a recovery ahead led by economic run cuts from higher-cost North Asia crackers and likely underperformance of ethane prices to oil prices.""We believe RIL's investment in new energy can be fully funded by internal cash generation from their old energy business (oil-to-chemical) and in turn, could drive one of the fastest net-zero target (2035) amongst large energy value chain companies,"" Goldman said.It forecast EBITDA and free-cash-flow generation of $35 billion and $4 billion respectively over FY22 to FY24 from RIL's old energy business as compared to $10 billion capex announced for New Energy.On its new energy strategy, the brokerage said RIL is planning to manufacture polysilicon, wafers, cells, modules, EV and grid storage batteries, elelctrolyzer, and fuel cells.""We see RIL as India's largest greenabler with the company's total projected outlay of $10 billion over the next three years. RIL has already spent $1.5 billion to acquire technologies across the solar battery and hydrogen ecosystems,"" it said.It saw significant expansion in the market for solar, battery and hydrogen manufacturing globally as well as in India and expected RIL to generate EBITDA of $3.6-12.2 billion by FY30 & FY40.""We value RIL's new energy segment at $30/48 billion in our base and bull case respectively,"" it said. ""The hyper integrated model can position RIL as one of the lowest cost green hydrogen producers with RIL targeting costs at around $1 per kg by end of this decade.""For consumer-facing businesses of Reliance, Goldman Sachs forecast a compounded annual growth rate of 29 per cent in EBITDA for telecom between FY22-25 and a 43 per cent rise in retail EBITDA.""While RIL is already the market leader in the telecom business, we expect market share wins to compound rising penetration for organized retail and e-commerce business.""We believe RIL's existing dominance in telecom and offline retail, combined with its partnership and the online traffic dominance of Facebook, can create the fastest-growing internet platform in India,"" it said.Within e-commerce, it forecast RIL's online GMV will reach $35 billion in FY25 with a 31 per cent market share.

Reliance has bought an average 5 million barrels a month for the June quarter, the sources said. Reliance did not immediately respond to a Reuters' email seeking comment. Before the Ukraine war, Indian refiners, including Reliance, rarely bought Russian oil owing to high freight costs. But Western sanctions against Russia since its Ukraine invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"", have prompted many oil importers to shun trade with Moscow, depressing its crude prices to record discount levels . Indian refiners have snapped up the cheap barrels as India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, is hit hard by high oil prices. India imports about 85% of its 5 million barrels per day oil needs. While New Delhi has called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, it has not explicitly condemned Moscow's actions. India has also abstained from voting on multiple United Nations resolutions on the invasion. Refinitiv's tanker flow data shows a supply of about 8 million barrels of Russian oil, mainly Urals, at the Reliance-operated Sikka port in western India, for arrival between April 5 and May 9.

The unequal treatment led to the removes move last week, when the local banks rebuffed billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate’s offer, derailing what would’ve been the largest acquisition in the Indian retail sector. Reliance Industries announced the purchase plan in August 2020 but struggled to complete the transaction in the face of legal challenges mounted by Amazon, which argued it had the first right of refusal contractually.Bank of India and State Bank of India, the main bankers to Future Retail, didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment on reasons for voting down the deal. Representatives for Future Group and Reliance also didn’t immediately comment. State-run lenders risked probes from federal agencies if they accepted these discriminatory terms, they said, explaining their preference now for a court-mediated insolvency process where bids are called in and there’s no risk of them being accused of cutting a bad deal. Bank of India has already requested an Indian court to initiate the process. Hard-nosed decisionThe hard-nosed decision by banks has pushed the teetering Future Retail, which ran one of the nation’s largest retail grocery chains before the pandemic struck, one step closer to bankruptcy.It has also taken the wind out of a tortuous two-year-old litigation between Reliance and Jeff Bezos-owned Amazon -- the e-tailer had started arbitration proceedings in Singapore to block the deal -- but left the door open for Ambani to snag these retail assets, possibly at an even cheaper price, under the bankruptcy process. “Reliance and other parties could be eligible to bid for its assets by submitting their resolution plans” even if Future Retail ends up in bankruptcy, according to Satwinder Singh, New Delhi-based partner at law firm Vaish Associates Advocates. “This would also lead to moratorium on any or all ongoing arbitration proceedings against Future.”While the local lenders were agreeable to the deal when it was first announced, a lot changed in the past year or so, the people said. While the Amazon lawsuit dragged on, the asset value eroded and the pandemic worsened the cash crunch at Future Retail that began defaulting on its debt repayments.Bloodless coupReliance dealt a body blow to the Kishore Biyani-led Future Group in February when it quietly began poaching employees and taking over rental leases of hundreds of stores earlier run by Future Retail and Future Lifestyle Fashions Ltd. Ambani’s bloodless coup prompted Amazon to suggest settlement talks on the bitter dispute and alarmed Future’s investors and lenders who worried about asset-stripping.The out-of-court truce talks between Amazon, Future and Reliance collapsed soon after they were initiated, the companies informed India’s top court on March 15. “A major turning point was when Reliance physically took over Future’s stores, which turned it into a no-holds barred situation,” said Devangshu Dutta, head of New Delhi-based retail consultancy Third Eyesight. “Before this the battle was being fought in courts and across the negotiating table. But at this point it moved over to the real business.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-a-creditor-revolt-scuttled-mukesh-ambanis-3-2-billion-retail-deal/articleshow/91081611.cms,1,1.0

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has raised India's nationally determined contribution (NDC) target of non-fossil energy capacity to 500 giga watts (GW) by 2030, from just over 151 GW currently. India's onshore wind capacity stands at over 40 GW, and for grid-connected or centralised solar power plants capacity is at around 60 GW. India is already exploring pilot projects in offshore wind power, but was unlikely to enter that space until after 2030 as the technology is still expensive, said Vaibhav Chaturvedi, a fellow at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) think tank. La Camera said the government expects green hydrogen - made from water and clean electricity - to power sectors, like steel, that find it hard to abate CO2 emissions. He also emphasized the need to set up ""standards and certification"" as India begins exporting green hydrogen with conglomerates Reliance Industries, Adani Enterprises , along with state-run energy firms NTPC Ltd. and Indian Oil Corp. setting out manufacturing plans. India plans to manufacture five million tonnes of green hydrogen per year by 2030 to meet its climate targets and become a global production and export hub for the fuel.

Global benchmark Brent is currently trading near $105 a barrel.91320701Both state and private refiners in the world’s third-biggest oil importer have bought more than 40 million barrels of Russian crude since the invasion of Ukraine in late February, the people said. That’s 20% more than Russia-to-India flows for the whole of 2021, according to Bloomberg calculations based on trade ministry data. 91193208India -- which imports more than 85% of its oil -- is among the few remaining buyers of Russian crude, a key source of revenue for Vladimir Putin’s regime. Evaporating European demand is putting severe pressure on Russia’s oil industry, with the government forecasting output could drop by as much as 17% this year. 91309509Flows of Russian oil to India aren’t sanctioned, but tightening international restrictions in areas such as marine insurance and pressure on New Delhi from the US are making the trade more difficult. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far resisted Western encouragement to scale back its relationship with Moscow because of the opportunity to get heavily discounted oil. India is also highly dependent on imports of Russian weapons. India’s state-run refiners can take about 15 million barrels a month -- about a tenth of overall imports -- if Russia agrees to the price demands and delivers the oil to India, the people said. Government-affiliated processors will stand to benefit from any potential agreement, they said. Private refiners such as Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy typically procure their feedstock individually. The Indian government didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.Moscow is looking at ways to keep supplies flowing to India -- both from the west via the Baltic Sea and on routes from the Russian Far East that become more accessible during the summer, the people said.The two countries have even been exploring re-routing some crude through Vladivostok in the Far East. While the sea trip from there to India would be quicker there would likely be major costs and logistical hurdles with this.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-wants-russia-to-discount-its-oil-to-less-than-70-a-barrel/articleshow/91308124.cms,1,1.0

This, in turn, would prompt foreign fund managers to take money off markets that are relatively riskier, including emerging ones like India.According to Religare Broking VP (research) Ajit Mishra, investors were cautious from the start of trading on Wednesday ahead of the US Fed meeting outcome scheduled late in the evening. “However, the surprise rate hike by the RBI caught the participants completely off guard and triggered a knee-jerk reaction. Apart from the policy tightening, hawkish commentary on inflation dragged the key indices lower.”Brokers are still cautious with all eyes on the US Fed meeting outcome amid the 50bps rate hike decision. Market players are also cautious about the RBI’s sudden turn from an ‘accommodative’ stance to a hawkish posture.

With foreign investors continuing to sell in the Indian market, brokers and dealers said Tuesday’s surge was more of a relief rally after days of fall, supported by some positive global cues including news about easing of the Covid-induced lockdown in China. Shortcovering in the later part of the session also helped lift the index above the 54k mark, they said.A sharp rally in sensex heavyweight Reliance Industries, along with strong buying in ICICI Bank, Infosys and ITC, contributed the most to the sensex’s gains.

This took the month’s total outflow to over Rs 30,000 crore, CDSL and BSE data showed.According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, the sharp uptick in the market was propelled by short-covering seen in several large caps and especially in sectors like metals, which were deeply oversold.

They are all credited in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index analysis, except the stake held by his mother.Ambani’s 27-storey Mumbai mansion, Antilia, is valued at more than $400 million, according to a September 2014 analysis by property surveyors that Bloomberg has counted in. He had also collected more than $3 billion in dividends as of November 2021. medium91684722Adani and Ambani profit in different waysThe economics of their businesses work differently, too. The ability of the two billionaires to increase profits depends on whether the retail prices of their commodities grow faster than their import prices.Ambani is the largest private importer of crude oil in India, and its Jamnagar refinery – the largest in the world – is designated for exports. Adani is the largest coal and edible oil importer in India but he mostly faces the Indian market.Let’s look at Adani first. His flagship AEL has invested more than $3 billion in coal mines in India, Australia and Indonesia. Their Carmichael mine in Australia started shipping coal this year.In a May 4 earnings call, AEL director Vinay Prakash said the company plans to raise the annual capacity of the Australian mine to 15 million tonnes through 2022-23, about 50% more than what its board approved for the first phase of the project, Bloomberg reported.New production and high prices have allowed AEL to clock a 30% jump in profit for the three months ended March – its highest in six quarters.The company’s future looks promising too. Global coal demand is expected to rise to a record level in 2022 and stay there through 2024, the International Energy Agency has said.But it’s a different set of calculations for Adani Wilmar, in which AEL holds 44%. The company’s revenues rose 46% in 2021-22, its first results since listing on February 8.Four-fifths of that revenue comes from edible oils. Overall, Adani Wilmar has a fifth of the Indian edible oil market cornered under its Fortune brand.Though analysis shows that edible oil companies haven’t yet fully passed on the global price rise to its customers, the segment contributed ₹1,289 crore to Adani Wilmar’s profits, while its overall profit before tax stood at ₹1,059 crore. The deficit of ₹230 crore came from the food and FMCG segment that continued to report losses, and higher financing costs. <iframe title=""Adani Wilmar: Global prices of edible oil rising, but not all of it passed on to Indian customers"" aria-label=""Interactive line chart"" id=""datawrapper-chart-et2zb"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/et2zb/2/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""400""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>On the other hand, almost 60% of Reliance's revenues comes from oil refining and petrochemicals. And surging retail prices have aided the company to post one of its biggest quarterly profits ever.Unlike Adani, Ambani is benefitting on the cost side too. Thanks to India’s refusal to vote against Russia at the UN and join the economic sanctions, the world’s third largest oil producer is offering its Urals crude at a hefty $30 a barrel discount to India.As a result, Russia became the fourth-largest oil supplier to India in April, up from the 10th position in March, with volumes set to rise further in coming months, tanker tracking data analysed by Reuters showed.Reliance’s Jamnagar facility, which has been upgraded to process Urals, is refining 20-30% of the Russian crude, an oil market analyst told TOI Plus on the condition of anonymity. It even deferred a scheduled maintenance of the facility to help churn out more diesel and petrol, whose margins have shot up to touch a three-year high. So it’s a win-win of lower costs and higher retail prices.  <iframe title=""Reliance's increasing margin: crude oil prices rising slower than retail prices of its output"" aria-label=""Interactive line chart"" id=""datawrapper-chart-VAYrM"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/VAYrM/2/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""400""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>Refiners in India exported 3.37 million tonnes of diesel in March, the highest since April 2020. And petrol exports reached a five-year high of 1.6 million tonnes, according to data from the government’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.Reliance's joint CFO V Srikanth told reporters on May 6: “We have minimised feedstock cost by sourcing arbitrage barrels,” industry-speak for oil that others wouldn’t buy because of the sanctions. Like AEL’s view of coal, Srikanth said, “The overall demand drivers are very promising.”It isn't just these two Indian billionaires benefiting from the commodities surge. Others include US oil and gas tycoons Harold Hamm, Richard Kinder and Michael Smith, and Indonesia's Low Tuck Kwong, the boss of coal mining company PT Bayan Resources, who have all seen their wealth increase this year.Though Adani, 59, and Ambani, 65, have unveiled a combined $142 billion in green investments over the next few decades to pivot away from coal and oil – the bedrock of their empires – they are also finding it hard to kick the fossil-fuel habit as the conflict stokes demand.With inputs from Bloomberg, Reuters and other agencies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-ukraine-war-made-adani-ambani-richer/articleshow/91683006.cms,0,0.6666666666666666

This is because of deep discounts of $35 per barrel, particularly on the sought-after Urals crude.The Journal said refineries are processing this crude and exporting petrol, diesel and chemicals such as alkylate, which is used to boost octane levels in petrol, to the US and Europe as they shun Russian products. It said traders and shippers are opting for high-sea transfers to obfuscate the origins of crude brought from Russia.The report mentions a ship chartered by Reliance Industries Ltd, India’s largest private refiner that runs the world’s largest refinery complex at Jamnagar, Gujarat, sailing from nearby Sikka port with a cargo of alkylate without mentioning a destination. It updated its destination to a US port three days later and delivered the cargo in New York.A Reliance spokesperson wasn’t immediately available. Other industry executives described the report as “hit job” on successful Indian refining industry and pointed out there’s no sanction on Russian oil and gas. On ship-to-ship transfers, the executives said it is driven by arbitrage and a common practice where cargoes are diverted to the benefit of traders. “Savings of even a few cents per barrel results in huge savings, given the volumes,” an executive of a refining firm said requesting anonymity. Another executive pointed out that state-run refineries too have bought discounted spot cargoes of Russian oil from traders through tenders since the conflict. RIL has been importing Russian oil for last three-four years as has been the Rosneft-owned Nayara, India’s second private refinery. RIL set up an alkylate unit at its export refinery over a decade back to be able to make petrol suitable for exporting to markets like California that have much higher fuel standards. It has been exporting the chemical for a decade.On the ship incident mentioned by the Journal, the executives said the vessels are chartered and once they set sail with the cargo, the companies have very little say except to see that the delivery is made on time.

Their proposal values Boots at more than £5 billion ($6.3 billion), one of the people said. The move could put Apollo and Reliance in pole position to buy Boots, after rival suitors started having second thoughts. Their main competitor, a consortium of Britain’s billionaire Issa brothers and TDR Capital, has been considering dropping out of the race due to disagreements over price, Bloomberg News reported in late May. Walgreens has been seeking a valuation of about £7 billion for Boots, people with knowledge of the matter have said.

""But if oil is not being available (at petrol pumps) and they are being exported... exported with such phenomenal profits. We need at least some of it for our own citizens and that is why we have taken this twin-pronged approach.""""It is not to discourage exports, it is not to discourage India as a refining hub. It is certainly not against profit earning, but extraordinary times do require some such steps,"" Sitharaman said.The windfall tax on oil producers was triggered by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) reporting bumper profits in the March quarter (when international prices soared to a near 14-year high of $139 per barrel) and record earnings in 2021-22.ONGC reported a record net profit of Rs 40,306 crore on a revenue of Rs 1,10,345 crore in the 2021-22 fiscal. OIL posted Rs 3,887.31 crore net profit in the fiscal. Vedanta's Cairn Oil & Gas, which is India's second-largest oil producer, too had bumper earnings.The new levy plus the oil industry development cess and royalty the producers currently pay will take the total incidence of taxation to about 60 per cent of the oil price.A windfall tax is a one-off tax on companies that have seen their profits surge extraordinarily not because of any clever investment decision they have taken or an increase in efficiency or innovation, but simply because of favourable market conditions.Recently, the UK levied a 25 per cent tax on ""extraordinary"" profits from North Sea oil and gas production to raise $6.3 billion.The export tax follows oil refiners, particularly Reliance Industries and Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy, making a killing in exporting fuel to deficit regions such as Europe and the US in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.They are said to have processed Russian crude oil available at a discount after it was shunned by the West and exported fuel produced from it to Europe and the US.The government also framed new rules requiring oil companies exporting petrol to sell in the domestic market the equivalent of 50 per cent of the amount sold to overseas customers for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. For diesel, this requirement has been put at 30 per cent of the volume exported.These restrictions on export are also aimed at shoring up domestic supplies at petrol pumps, some of which had dried up in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat as private refiners preferred exporting fuel to selling locally.Exports were preferred as retail petrol and diesel prices by dominant PSU retailers have been capped at levels way lower than the cost. This meant that private retailers, who control less than 10 per cent of the market share, either sell fuel at loss or lose market share if they were to sell at a higher cost.Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj said the export tax will be applied uniformly on all exports from any refinery -- be it a domestic unit or an only-for-exports (SEZ) facility. But the export restriction, mandating a certain amount to be sold locally, will not be applicable for SEZ units, he said.Reliance operates two refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat -- one is a domestic tariff area facility while the other is an SEZ refinery. Nayara has a domestic tariff area unit at Vadinar in Gujarat.The finance ministry, in a statement, said crude prices have risen sharply in recent months which has benefited domestic producers who sell oil to domestic refineries at international parity prices.""As a result, the domestic crude producers are making windfall gains. Taking this into account, a cess of Rs 23,250 per tonne has been imposed on crude,"" it said. ""Import of crude would not be subject to this cess.""Small producers, whose annual production of crude in the preceding financial year is less than 2 million barrels, will be exempt from this new cess, the ministry said.""Also, to incentivise an additional production over the preceding year, no cess will be imposed on such quantity of crude that is produced in excess of last year's production by a crude producer.""The ministry said while crude prices have increased sharply in recent months, the rates of diesel and petrol have shown a sharper increase.""The refiners export these products at globally prevailing prices, which are very high. As exports are becoming highly remunerative, it has been seen that certain refiners are drying out their pumps in the domestic market,"" it said without naming any company.In view of this, cesses equal to Rs 6 per litre on petrol and Rs 13 per litre on diesel have been imposed on their exports. These cesses would apply to any export of diesel and petrol from the country.""These measures would not have any adverse impact on domestic retail prices of diesel and petrol. Thus, domestic retail prices would remain unchanged. At the same time these measures will ensure domestic availability of the petroleum products,"" it said.A special additional excise duty (SAED) of Rs 6 per litre has been imposed on exports of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF). Like diesel and petrol, the international prices of ATF have risen sharply and so an additional duty has been imposed.

The tax on firms that have increased product exports to gain from higher overseas margins took effect on July 1, as the government moves to boost domestic supply and revenue. The taxes, and some accompanying export curbs, will hit the earnings of companies such as Reliance Industries, Nayara Energy, which is partly owned by Russia's Rosneft , the Oil and Natural Gas Corp, Oil India Ltd and Vedanta Ltd. ""The taxation would be reviewed every 15 days,"" Bajaj said, adding that it would depend on international crude prices. ""If crude prices fall, then windfall gains will cease and windfall taxes would also be removed."" The government believes such windfall gains will cease once prices fall $40 from existing levels, Bajaj said. Brent crude futures slipped on Monday to about $111.27 a barrel, as fears of a global recession weighed on the market even as supply remains tight amid lower OPEC output, unrest in Libya and sanctions on Russia.

In Rajasthan, it is almost like a divine intervention. People in the vast desert expanses, lived with a stoic enduran","They call it energy from heaven. In Rajasthan, it is almost like a divine intervention. People in the vast desert expanses, lived with a stoic endurance of untold hardship the geography unleashes, never imagined the harsh rays would turn into hopes.As the country steps on the gas to minimize the dominance of energy from coalbased plants, Rajasthan has taken the steering wheel to make solar the energy of the future. Today, the desert state produces the largest quantity of solar power in thecountry, having an installed capacity of over 14,000 megawatt. Given the prospects of new projects and advantages of the whole ecosystem, the number one solar energy producer will remain the leader in times to come.Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd MD Anil Dhaka says, “The new project pipeline is very robust. Projects of 19,000 MW are already in various stages of approval process which will come on stream by 2025. But we are looking to add 30,000 MW. ”The emergence of solar energy as a viable source has been shifting sands in the desert regions of the state that were crying for livelihood opportunities and critical resources for development. What was a bane in about 15 years ago has come as a boon, making the uncultivable land productive, the uneducated employed, while creating contractors, vendors, suppliers and service providers out of ordinary unskilled people.More than that it has attracted hundreds of educated youths in the state and offered them a launchpad for their entrepreneurial journeys. Industry estimates suggest that Rajasthan has added around 650 companies in the sector. TOI talks to a few to understand their experiences.Sunil Bansal | Founder, Diwakar Solar & president of Rajasthan Solar AssociationOne of the earliest solar entrepreneurs, Bansal says that when he entered the business in 2008, it was simply an intuition of a bright future for the sector. After post-graduation he was into traditional businesses.“I have been part of the industry when the tariffs were over Rs 17 per unit of power, just before the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission was launched in 2010. But as the prices of solar panels crashed in subsequent years, everybody realised that it is a matter of time before solar reaches, at least, the rates at which traditional power was sold. In fact, today, it is cheaper than coal-based thermal power,” says Bansal.He says that in coming years, Rajasthan will be the ground zero for generation projects given the availability of cheap desert land, high solar insolation, and the transmission infrastructure.“People running big businesses in big cities are coming to Rajasthan to meet their power needs, thanks to the interstate transmission (IST) infrastructure and policy. Solar energy is called infirm power and it is produced in the day only. But with hydrogen projects, that handicap will be a thing of the past. Hydrogen produced through solar energy can be used at any time and place. Similarly, pump storage is another technology where infirmity will cease to exist. These, in addition to IST projects, have immense possibilities for Rajasthan,” says Bansal.Rajeshwar Singh Rajpurohit | Founder, Ultravibrant Solar Energy Pvt LtdRajpurohit left two government jobs as an electrical engineer and two private jobs, but finally found his true calling in the solar sector. The advancement of technology and the steep fall in panels had already made solar very lucrative when he joined the sector in 2015.Purohit says, “I don’t belong to a business family, but after working a few years in Mahindra Solarize, I realized that it is going to grow big. In the past seven years, I have installed solar rooftop projects worth 35,000 kilowatt. While the margins have been squeezed in recent years due to an influx of new players, I think it’s the best business to be in. I feel proud I am contributing to a sustainable future. ”Ramakant Jangid | Founder, Corona SoltechAfter an engineering degree in 2013, Jangid tried to prepare for government jobs but gave it up thinking of inordinate delays due to paper leakage, reexaminations, etc. After a year in HDFC Bank as junior accountant, he entered the solar pump business in 2017. But as margins got reduced, he set up his engineering, procurement, and commissioning (EPC) venture Corona Soltech.“Last year, my revenues were Rs 9 crore. This year, it is on course to hit Rs 15 crore. If solar has to be a country-wide movement, then rooftop has to play a bigger role. We expect the government to provide us with a stable policy which will help us to plan ahead and keep commitments,” says Jangid.Prateek Agarwal | Founder, Solar91 Cleantech Pvt LtdAfter passing out from IIT Roorkee in 2013, Prateek Agarwal worked for Reliance Industries. But soon he got disenchanted with the world of fossil fuel as he started tracking the rise of solar power, which was getting cheaper by the day then.“I had an entrepreneurial streak and that came to fore when I saw the viability of solar energy,” says Agarwal. He says the if businesses are allowed to buy power from generators without much tax burden and system fees, open access will be a game changer. “It has already been driving the sector, but some irritants need to be removed. Secondly, the state needs to push solar equipment manufacturing which will create an avalaunche of economic activities in the state. ”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/countrys-solar-leader-rajasthan-set-to-add-30000-mw-capacity-in-next-3-years/articleshow/92678990.cms,2,1.0

Buffett became CEO and majority shareholder in 1970, meaning he had been in the job 14 years before Zuckerberg was even born.Of the 58 CEOs the study could find education history for, only two of them did not achieve a degree, and both of these did attend university. 28 of the CEOs had a standard degree, a further 22 went on to achieve a master’s in their various fields of study, and eight were awarded a doctorate for their years of study.The two odd ones out without a degree are Larry Ellison (CEO of Oracle), and Mark Zuckerberg (CEO of Facebook).

He took himself out of India to this jurisdiction in order to commit those offences – far from this accused being some sort of popular hero or activist in Gujarat, he inspired fear among the people he lived with. It was only when the accused was in the UK that victims came forward to say how they had been treated at the hands of the accused,” she said. She warned the judge ought to be careful about Patel “manipulating the court” and said there was “ample evidence” he was exaggerating his PTSD.She said he had no family or friends in the UK and could not speak English so was isolated in Belmarsh prison and would be better off in a three square metre Gujarat prison cell given the government of India assurances about his treatment and the fact there was less drug and alcohol abuse in Gujarat prisons.To assuage concerns that Patel might receive an irreducible sentence in India, which would violate article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Dobbin pointed to the assurances from the government of India which stated that if convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, Patel would be eligible to apply for premature release after 14 years.She refuted the notion that Patel was a “thorn in the side of Reliance Industries” because he had “ran a campaign against Mr Nathwani” and so would not receive a fair trial in India branding this as “hearsay.” She said he was a “dangerous manipulative person as far as India is concerned”. ""The court need to assess the credibility of the assertions that his prosecution is politically inspired and he was ill treated at the hands of India. Nothing he did is consistent with someone coming here to get humanitarian protection. He has had recourse to false ID documents and bank cards and did not claim for asylum. He lay low for a long time as had false ID.

Time and Date  The AGM will be held via video conferencing for the third consecutive year on August 29. The meeting will start at 2:00 pm IST, with addresses and presentations expected from chairman Mukesh Ambani and other members of the company’s board and subsidiaries.  Also Read | Reliance to hold its 45th AGM on August 29: All you need to know  The board of directors and shareholders will then vote on 11 resolutions. Six of them are special resolutions, including the appointment of Hital Meswani as a whole-time director, and the insertion of clauses in its articles of association with respect to its new energy business.  Stock Movement  Reliance shares tend to move considerably ahead of and after the AGM. The shares have averaged negligible returns a week prior to the AGM, based on data of the past 10 years. However, they rose almost 4 percent a week after the event, Bloomberg data showed.  Additionally, the shares gained 2.3 percent a month before the AGM and returned more than 6 percent a month after the event, the data showed.  Trading in the stock tends to pick up around the annual event. On average, daily volumes on the counter have spiked 317 percent on the day of the AGM over the past five years. AGM day is easily the most active for the stock.  Big Expectations  As with every Reliance AGM, investors have a set of expectations.  This year, the focus will be on the consumer retail business once again, after chatter that a time line is likely to be announced for the listing of Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail. The induction of private equity investors in both its consumer-facing subsidiaries in 2020 was seen as a stepping stone towards their eventual listing.  Brokerage JP Morgan India said in a recent note that Reliance has enhanced disclosures around related-party transactions, which is seen as a step towards greater transparency ahead of the listing.  “While it is too early to say if the increased disclosures on the large transactions between the subsidiaries are a step on the road to the listing of these businesses, it would be seen as a positive,” JP Morgan said.  Another key expectation will be around the new energy business, which emerged as the biggest takeaway at last year’s AGM. Reliance has since invested in acquiring companies in the segment and expanding capacity.  The company plans to build four gigafactories to manufacture solar panels, electric batteries, green hydrogen and hydrogen fuel cells with an investment of $80 billion. The company sees renewable energy and green hydrogen as tectonic shifts in meeting the world’s energy demands.  In the company’s annual report, Ambani said he expects the green energy business to be the crown jewel of the company in the next seven years, much like he heralded the consumer-facing businesses about seven years ago.  Brokerage JM Financial said investors will await any indication of the induction of strategic investors in the company’s oil-to-chemicals and green energy business as Relance steps up activity in the space.  Attention will also be on Reliance’s plan to roll out 5G mobile phone services after the company mopped up the most spectrum in the recent auction. Reliance invested $11.3 billion to acquire 25 gigahertz of spectrum from the government.  Investors will wait for indications of the pricing of the new 5G services that step-down subsidiary Reliance Jio will offer.  Traders can expect good moves in the stock if the company were to make announcements with respect to these expectations, said dealers.  Beyond AGM  Reliance’s June quarter performance was slightly underwhelming, given the expectations built up due to the surge in global refining margins. The introduction of a special additional excise duty on refining exports also dampened spirits, but analysts remain buoyed over the stock’s prospects.  Of 39 brokerages covering the company, 31 have an outright ‘buy’ rating on the stock while three have a ‘hold’ rating with an average upside of about 12 percent expected in the scrip over the next 12 months.  UBS Securities upgraded the stock recently to a ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’ as it factored in opportunities in the green energy business, which it said could create additional value of $35 billion for the company by 2030.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to raise the share of gas in India's energy mix to 15% by 2030 from 6.2%, helping it progress towards meeting a 2070 net zero carbon-emission goal. To incentivise gas producers and boost local output, since 2014 India has linked local gas prices to a formula tied to global benchmarks, including Henry Hub, Alberta gas, NBP and Russian gas. In 2016, the country began fixing the ceiling prices of gas produced from ultra-deep water and challenging fields and allowed marketing freedom to the operators of these fields. The state-set local gas prices and ceiling rates are at a record high and are expected to rise further due to a surge in global gas prices triggered by the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The panel has to submit its report by end of this month, according to the order. The committee, headed by energy expert Kirit Parikh, will include members from the fertiliser ministry, as well as gas producers and buyers. Apart from ensuring fair prices to end consumers, the panel will also suggest a 'market oriented, transparent and reliable pricing regime for India's long term vision for ensuring a gas based economy,"" the order said. A government source said the panel's recommendations will not be reflected in the next six-month revision of local gas prices from October, as cabinet approval is required for implementation. India's fertiliser and oil minister did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Higher gas prices tend to boost the earnings of producers like Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd, Oil India Ltd and Reliance Industries but also stoke inflation as prices turns costly for households, industries, and the fertiliser, power and transport sectors. IInflation peaked at 7.79% in April before easing in the last three months, but has remained above the Reserve Bank of India's mandated target band of 2%-6% for seven consecutive months.

RIL will invest $32 million in SenseHawk by acquiring the US company’s existing shareholders and by infusing capital into it.

RIL is yet to report new energy as a separate business segment in its financial results. The SenseHawk deal, subject to regulatory and other customary closing conditions, is expected to be completed before the end of this year.

African volumes upIndia's monthly Russian oil buying has fallen since hitting a record high in June.About 2 million tonnes (14.35 million barrels) of Russian crude have been loaded for India so far this month versus 3.55 million tonnes of August, including 585,090 tonnes of ESPO crude, Refinitiv data showed on Thursday.In contrast, India has loaded 2.35 million tonnes of African oil so far this month versus 1.16 million tonnes in August, the data showed.Overall, India is likely to lift less crude in September due to planned maintenance shutdowns of units at some refineries operated by companies including Indian Oil Corp Reliance Industries, Bharat Petroleum and Nayara Energy.Middle East producers have also cut official selling prices for their supplies in October, hitting the appeal of Russian oil, said Ehsan Ul Haq, an analyst with Refinitiv.While supplies from Russia to India takes about a month, Middle Eastern crude arrives in a week, he added.Shiptracking data from Kpler showed that all but one seaborne ESPO cargo for September departure are heading to China.Russian ESPO exports in September slipped to 720,000 barrels per day (bpd) from more than 800,000 bpd in July and August, the data showed.""ESPO from the Far East is a short-haul journey for China and freight rates have also risen. So China is taking more oil from the Far East and not so much from Baltic or Black Sea ports,"" Haq said.Russia's local crude processing has also increased, curtailing supplies for export, he said.

The Mumbai-based billionaire has picked a manager to hire staff for the new entity and get it running, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. The Ambanis have also chosen real estate, one of the people said. A spokesman for Reliance, who also represents Ambani, wasn’t available for comment.Ambani is the latest in a series of ultra-rich people to pick Singapore for their family offices — the organizations set up to manage the affairs of wealthy clans — joining the likes of hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio and Google co-founder Sergey Brin.The city-state has become an attractive hub for family offices thanks to its low taxes and relative security. The Monetary Authority of Singapore estimates about 700 were in place by the end of 2021, up from 400 a year earlier. But the rising number of global rich crowding Singapore’s shores is also resulting in higher prices for cars, housing and other goods. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong signaled in an August interview that the wealthy may face more taxes to boost inclusive growth.Ambani’s move to set up the family office ties in with his larger vision of taking his retail-to-refining empire global and acquiring assets outside India. While announcing the appointment of Aramco’s chairman on the board of Reliance in 2021, the billionaire told his shareholders that this marked “the beginning of internationalization” of his conglomerate, without elaborating. “You will hear more about our international plans in the times to come,” he had said at the time.Reliance paid $79 million for Stoke Park Ltd. in April 2021, adding an iconic UK locale that’s been the setting for two James Bond films. It also bought an indirect 73.4% stake in Mandarin Oriental New York for $98.15 million in January and an $80 million beach-side villa in Dubai this year.Ambani, who is worth an estimated $83.7 billion according to the Bloomberg Wealth Index, wants the Singapore family office to be running within a year, one of the people said. His wife Nita Ambani is also helping to set it up, the people added.Reliance has been pivoting from its legacy oil refining and petrochemicals business toward e-commerce, green energy and the expansion of its retail footprint across India. In 2020, its technology venture Jio Platforms Ltd. lured more than $25 billion from marquee Silicon Valley investors including Meta Platforms Inc. and Google.

The amended norm took effect on Thursday.The move is expected to make modules costlier by 33-34%, E&Y tax partner Saurabh Agarwal told TOI, adding, however, the government’s intent appears to promote domestic manufacturing.The project imports scheme allows import of machinery, instruments and apparatus etc needed for setting up new units or expansion of an existing unit at a concessional duty of 5%.Solar promoters whose projects were already underway when the government announced in 2021 its intent to impose 40% basic customs duty on cells and modules from April 2022 took refuge under the scheme as utilities refused to bear the additional cost.After the 2021 announcement, discoms (distribution companies) refused to pay a single paisa more than the tariff discovered through bidding and threatened to cancel the power purchase agreements, head of a Delhi-based solar major said requesting anonymity.The concessional duty was an option that gave developers some safeguard for their investments, he said, adding now the promoters face the prospect of their PPAs being cancelled by utilities.An industry analyst said 10,000 MW capacity auctioned before 2021 and about 5,000 MW capacity that are expected to be commissioned in the current fiscal will be particularly vulnerable to the latest change in duty structure.He said moving forward, the latest duty tweak will give an edge to players that have major manufacturing plans such as Reliance Industries Ltd, the Adani group and others.There were some players who said the loss of concessional duty could disturb the pace of capacity addition and impact the target of achieving 500 gigawatts capacity by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/solar-projects-lose-duty-sop-rs-25-k-crore-investment-may-be-hit/articleshow/94993980.cms,1,0.3333333333333333

RIL's consoli,"NEW DELHI: India's most valuable company Reliance Industries on Friday reported a flat profit for the second quarter of the financial year 2022-23. RIL's consolidated net profit stood at Rs 13,656 crore in Q2 as against a profit of Rs 13,680 crore in same period last fiscal. The Mukesh Ambani-led firm's profits tumbled after its mainstay oil-to-chemical business was impacted by a fall in refinery margins and export tax on refined fuels. In terms of quarterly numbers, RIL's profit plunged about 24%.The oil-to-chemical (O2C) business that witnessed a great run over the past few quarters on higher demand for transportation fuels, helped by cheap Russian crude, saw refinery margins cooling off from record highs in the quarter.A bigger shock came in the form of windfall tax on exports of gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel levied by the government of India.The export duty adversely impacted profit for the quarter by Rs 4,039 crore, Reliance said.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the O2C segment dropped 5.9% year-on-year to Rs 11,968 crore.Reliance also shut a crude distillation unit and gasoline making fluid catalytic cracker at Jamnagar in Gujarat in September for usual maintenance. If not for the windfall profit tax, the net profit would have been 20 per cent higher.The windfall profit tax cost the company Rs 4,039 crore in the quarter, lowering pre-tax earnings from the O2C business by almost 6 per cent to Rs 11,968 crore.The O2C earnings also fell because of lower refining margins and the company's oil refinery taking a planned maintenance shutdown during the quarter, lowering the output.This was offset by a 27 per cent jump in the net profit of its digital arm Jio Platforms to Rs 4,729 crore and a 51 per jump in pre-tax earnings from the retail business of Rs 4,404 crore. The firm's revenues from oil and gas production rose 3x to Rs 3,171 crore.This is the first quarterly dip in profit that the company has reported since January-March.Commenting on the results, Mukesh D Ambani, chairman and managing director, Reliance Industries Limited, said the quarter saw record performance in the company's consumer businesses, which continue to scale new milestones every quarter.""We saw consistent net subscriber additions and higher engagement in the digital services segment,"" he said. ""Jio has announced a beta trial for its industry-leading standalone 5G services and is making rapid progress for an ambitious and the fastest ever roll out of True 5G on a pan-India basis.""The retail business delivered record performance with a strong revival in footfalls, store additions and digital integration, he noted.""Performance of our O2C business reflects subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products. Transportation fuel margins were better than last year but significantly lower sequentially,"" he said.""Segment performance was also impacted by the introduction of special additional excise duties (windfall profit tax) during the quarter to ensure stable supply and lower volatility in the domestic market.""Reliance Jio Infocomm, the nation's largest telecom operator by subscribers, saw continued to see an uptick in per-user revenue - Rs 177.2 per subscriber per month in Q2 from Rs 175.7 per user per month in the previous month.

While the R-Cluster has a plateau gas production of about 12.9 mmscmd, the Satellite Cluster will have a peak output of 6 mmscmd. The MJ field will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd.Combined gas output from R-Cluster and Satellite Cluster stood at more than 19 mmscmd during July-September, according to Roy.Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest two -- were brought into production in April 2009, and MA, the only oilfield in the block, was put into production in September 2008.While the MA field stopped producing in 2019, the output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February 2020. Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production. MJ's reservoirs are about 2000 metres below the D1-D3 gas fields.Reliance holds a 66.67 per cent operating interest in KG-D6, with bp holding the remaining 33.33 per cent.

It has now brought this homegrown brand to the front end by opening its first EBO,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Retail is expanding its business into the fast-growing toy sector through its brand Rowan to operate in the affordable segment with a smaller shop size.The company was running its toy distribution business through Rowan. It has now brought this homegrown brand to the front end by opening its first EBO (exclusive brand outlet) at Gurugram in NCR in the last quarter with a store size of 1,400 sq feet.Under this new format, Reliance Retail, the retail arm of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries, will have a range of affordable toys not only from the brand Rowan on its shelves but also from other brands, said an industry source.Reliance Retail also has the iconic British toy retail brand Hamleys in its fold.Hamleys is the world's oldest toy retailer and was acquired by Reliance in 2019, marking the first acquisition of a global retail brand by the company.Hamleys would continue to operate in the premium space, while brand Rowan would help Reliance Retail to tap the mid-premium and mass segment with its affordable offerings, the source said.The unit value of toys will be much lower at Rowan stores, and the discounts offered will be higher. Hence, products will be more affordable, he added.Moreover, unlike Hamleys, the store size of Rowan stores will be much smaller, ideally measuring between 500-1,000 sq ft, he noted.""We also launched Rowan, which is a new format from Reliance as a toy store, which is a small format, typically around 500-1,000 sq ft in size, selling more affordable toys. So, that format also got launched during this quarter, and we'll also see it further ramp up as we go along,"" Reliance Retail Head of strategy and business development Gaurav Jain said.Hamleys currently has a global footprint across 15 countries with over 200 doors and is India's largest chain of toy stores.With both brands in its portfolio, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) is one of the leading toy distributors.Earlier in June this year, Reliance Brands Ltd (RBL), a unit of RRVL, had announced a joint venture with Italian company Plastic Legno SPA and acquired a 40 per cent stake in the latter's toy manufacturing business in India.According to a joint report by industry body FICCI and KPMG, the Indian toy market was estimated to be around $ 1 billion in 2019-20 and is expected to double to $2 billion by 2024-25.

The focus is on a broad base of multi-tier, age-group engagements that operate throughout the year. Lalnghinglova Hmar (Tetea), honorary secretary, MFA, & executive committee member of All India Football Federation (AIFF), said on this development, ""We are extremely happy with the partnership forged between Mizoram Football Association and Reliance Foundation, and this project can be a game-changer for Mizoram and Indian football. The community participation in the proposed Naupang League will add a different dimension to the competition as it will be a collective participation of kids, parents and the local community which will drive and motivate the team like never before and fuel the competitiveness of the league. The pilot project in Mizoram which we are confident will be successful, can be used as a blueprint for grassroots development, and the first of its kind, in Indian football. We are looking forward to the kick-off and in the same year the FIFA Under-17 Women's World Cup is in India and FIFA Men's World Cup 2022, will give extra enthusiasm to the kids. MFA is glad that Reliance Foundation has been providing a platform to young kids so that they can bring alive their sports dreams."" The Naupang League will be hosted in four locations in Mizoram with two models of the league structure. The Mizoram FA and District FAs will host the leagues in Lunglei and Kolasib, enabled by RFYC, while two leagues in Aizawl and Champhai will be owned and operated by Reliance Foundation Young Champs. The age categories begin at Under-6 and continue until Under 13 years with multiple game formats. A minimum of 30 games will be played by the kids. RF Young Champs will further integrate with RF Youth Sports in the region to ensure additional games and competitive exposure to deserving players. The Mizoram football ecosystem is set to benefit immensely from Reliance Foundation's Young Champs as its programs include coach education and development; referee development; weekly coaching program for kids; quarterly camps (local) for emerging elite; enablement of Inter-District championship; and Reliance Foundation Young Champs camps in Mumbai to understate match day operations better.

The existing promoters of Naturals Salon-parent, Groom India Salons & Spa, could continue running operations and Reliance's funds would help expand its network of 700 salons in 20 states by four- to five-fold, the Economic Times had earlier reported, citing executives aware of the development. ""Reliance Retail is yet to acquire the 49% of Naturals' stake,"" Naturals CEO CK Kumaravel said in a LinkedIn post, sharing the ET report. However, neither Kumaravel nor the ET report mentioned a deal value. Naturals and Reliance did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. Chennai-based Naturals, founded in the early 2000s, aims to run 3,000 salons by 2025, according to its website. Reliance's deal for Naturals comes just weeks after it launched its first in-house premium fashion and lifestyle store, while media reports have said Reliance is advanced talks for the India rights to LVMH-owned beauty chain Sephora. Salons were among the hardest hit businesses at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Naturals' CEO Kumaravel even sought the government's help in May 2020 to keep the chain afloat.

The proposed deal will mark Metro’s exit from one of the world’s fastest-growing markets, which it had entered 19 years ago with big hopes.Sources said Metro has agreed to RIL’s purchase deal for its local cash-and-carry business, which also includes the Indian conglomerate retaining the former’s employees for at least one year. RIL, India’s largest company in terms of market value, will also gain Metro’s wholesale centers across the country and land assets as part of the transaction. RIL declined to comment on the report. It, however, said that the company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis. RIL is the country’s largest organised retailer in terms of store network and the proposed buy of Metro’s wholesale unit will further deepen its operations. Reliance Retail is perhaps the only company in the country that has both front- and back-end capabilities to absorb the operations of Metro’s India cash and carry operations, a source said, adding that whether it is to supplying to kiranas through its online grocery service JioMart, using Metro’s wholesale centres as warehouses or fine-tuning Metro’s sourcing at the back-end to benefit local MSMEs. RIL’s retail interests are routed through its subsidiary Reliance Retail Ventures, in which marquee international investors like Mubadala, ADIA and PIF own stakes. Ambani built the retail unit using cash from his core refining and petrochemical business, enticing customers with superior value, revered international labels and acquisitions. Reliance Retail is the country’s largest (with 16,547 stores) and most profitable (Rs 12,381 crore in FY22) retailer. In the second quarter of this fiscal, it had acquired a majority stake in makeup brand Insight Cosmetics. RIL and Metro have been engaged in discussions for a potential deal for some time now but differences over valuation slowed the process. Both have now agreed to shake hands, another source said.The dynamics of the wholesale business in India, low margins, among other factors, has forced the German wholesaler to evaluate its India strategy including an exit. In 2014, France-based Carrefour exited the wholesale business in India. Six years later, Flipkart had acquired Walmart India, operator of Best Price cash-and-carry business.Metro forayed into the country in 2003 and currently operates more than 30 wholesale distribution centers, catering to business customers only.

The country's diesel exports to Europe have increased post Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, averaging at 730,000 million tonne per month post-invasion, versus the pre-invasion average of 570,000 mt/month, according to a report by Refinitiv’s Commodity Research.Europe is the largest importer of diesel worldwide and is net short of the distillate that it uses for heating, road transport, power generation and industrial use. Seaborne imports into the region surged to an all-time high of 7.5 million tons in October, surpassing the previous record of 6.6 million mt in November 2021 by a whopping 13.6 percent, Refinitiv assessments show.Now that winter is approaching, demand for diesel will peak in Europe, exacerbated by a full import ban on seaborne Russian oil imports and spiralling gas prices made worse by outages to the Nord Stream gas pipeline that has spurred gasto-oil switching for power-generation, which could blowout in the event of a harsher and prolonged winter.Europe is looking at suppliers in Asia to meet some of their supply gap, particularly for winter-specification diesel, with India and South Korea emerging as the main suppliers.According to the report, Indian refiners are taking advantage of both strong gasoil margins, which saw front-month 10-ppm gasoil/Dubai cracks soar to multiple record-highs that culminated in the all-time high of above $70 per barrel, and steeply discounted Russian crudes, which they have imported at almost 10 times the volume vs pre-invasion levels, at 2.82 million mt/month during March- September.Reliance has emerged as the country’s largest importer of Russian crudes and is also its largest diesel exporter. Its 5.68 million mt/month capacity plant has been running at 93.8% post-invasion, above the pre-invasion average of 92.3%, but still below the pre-Covid 2015-2019 average of 110%, signalling that there is upside to its diesel production, noted the report.""Runs averaged at 99.86% of the country’s 5.14 million bpd capacity post-invasion, versus the pre-invasion average of 94.26%. Gasoil output averaged at 9.75 million mt/month for March-August and hit a record-high of 10.57 million mt in March, well above the pre-invasion average of 8.95 million mt/month,"" it added.However, only private refiners Reliance and Nayara Energy can produce EU winter-specification diesel. The other state-owned refiners have focused their output to cover domestic demand, which are also rising in October, after the low-demand monsoon season ended. India's fuel consumption rose to its highest in four months in October, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the oil ministry showed on Monday.Consumption in October was 6.7% higher than September, while also up 3.4% year-on-year at 18.37 million tonnes, the data showed.Sales of gasoline, or petrol, were up 8.8% from 2021 at 2.99 million tonnes, while diesel rose 5.5% at 6.98 million tonnes, the PPAC showed.Cooking gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) sales decreased 3.3% to 2.40 million tonnes, while naphtha sales fell 24% to 0.96 million tonnes.Sales of bitumen, used for making roads, were 11.4% lower, while fuel oil use edged up 1% in October.The data indicates that ""the negative impact of the monsoon season is now coming to an end,"" Refinitiv analyst Ehsan Ul Haq said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/winter-is-coming-and-its-advantage-reliance-amid-a-looming-energy-crisis/articleshow/95417471.cms,0,0.0

It also expects India's per-capita income to rise from $2,278 now to $5,242 by 2031, setting the stage for a discretionary spending boom.Moreover, the number of households earning more than $35,000/year is likely to rise fivefold in the coming decade, to over 25 million. 95730020""Incrementally, India will add more than $400 billion to its GDP every year, a scale that is only surpassed by the US and China,"" Morgan Stanley's chief Asia economist Chetan Ahya wrote in the Financial Times.A confluence of favourable domestic and global forces supports the projection, while there has also been a shift in government's policy approach from redistribution to boosting investment and job creation.According to Ahya, tax reforms in the form of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a cut in the corporate tax rate, and the introduction of production-linked incentive schemes are examples of shifts in government policy.And there are three primary reasons why India has the conditions in place for an economic boom. These include: 1. Offshoring:  95730004“The pandemic only enhanced India's attractiveness as the office to the world... in the post-Covid environment, global CEOs appear more comfortable with both work from home and work from India. The emergence of distributed delivery models, along with tighter labor markets globally, has accelerated outsourcing to India.” According to MS, during the two pandemic years, the number of people employed in this industry in India rose from 4.3 million to 5.1 million, and the country's share of global services trade rose 60 basis points (bps) to 4.3%. In the coming decade, the number of people employed in India for jobs outside the country is likely to at least double to over 11 million, and MS estimates that the global spending on outsourcing could rise from $180 billion per year to around $500 billion by 2030.And, apart from being an office to the world, India will also become the factory to the world. “We anticipate a wave of manufacturing capex owing to government policies aimed at lifting corporate profits' share of GDP via tax cuts and hard dollars for investing in specific sectors, and we note that performance-linked incentive (PLI) schemes now total $33 billion across 14 sectors. Multinationals are more optimistic than ever about investing in India, as the all-time high on our MNC Sentiment Index shows,” it said.2. Digital differentiationMS pointed out that “India is pursuing a distinct model for the digitalization of its economy, supported by a public utility called IndiaStack”. It further said that IndiaStack — which operates at a population scale, is a transaction-led, low-cost, high-volume, small-ticket-size system with embedded lending — will take India from a 'prepaid' economy to a 'postpaid' (buy now, pay later) one. 95730323 95730336 957303603. Energy transition: While the first two drivers are unique to India, the world has seen energy transitions before. 95730159""The difference for India is that both its energy consumption and energy sources are changing simultaneously in a disruptive fashion. Another difference is that India's energy needs are still growing,and therefore legacy capacity using fossil fuels will not be destroyed as it transitions to a higher share of renewables. India's per-capita energy consumption is likely to rise 60%, on our estimates, to about 1450 Watts per day in the coming decade, with two-thirds of the incremental supply coming from renewable sources. We believe this will 1) positively impact India’s terms of trade,2)entail about three-quarters of a trillion dollars in energy capex,3)eventually reduce headline inflation volatility as the imported energy share of GDP declines, 4) lower fertilizer subsidies,5) improve living conditions,and 6) create new demand for solutions such as electric vehicles, cold-storage chains,and green hydrogen-powered trucks and buses."" Supporting these factors are India's rise in the world economy, its commitment to the Paris Accord and major investments in terms of both dollars and institutional infrastructure to leverage India's biometric identity system, Aadhaar,and)government policies targeted at lifting the share of profits in GDP, with a concomitant positive effect on investment.""India is entering a phase where incomes will be compounding at a fast rate on a high base. For context, India took 31 years since 1991 to raise its GDP by $3 trillion. According to our projections, it will take just another seven years for the GDP to grow by an additional $3 trillion,"" said Ahya.Morgan Stanley is not alone in this view.According to a report by IME Capital, India's highly favourable demographics, large & fast-growing middle-class with rising aspirations, incrasing Per Capita Income plus structural reforms like GST, RERA, Financial Inclusion, labour Reforms, manufacturing Focus Policies and a strong Digital Stack make it ripe as investment destination. 95730235 95730250 95730264 95730271 95730281Will China and India become the world's top economies? The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) released a research report in November titled ""The future of global economic power”, which predicts China and India will become the world’s top two economies in the long-term with 27.0 percent and 16.2 percent of 2100 world GDP, respectively. ""If recent productivity continues and demographic projections prove accurate, India will account for one third of world output in 2100 and China for over one fifth. The US output share will grow slightly while other developed countries shrink dramatically,"" said economists Seth G. Benzell and Laurence J. Kotlikoff. Using the UN’s demographic data and IMF economic data, the paper states that ""at the turn of the century, China’s share of world GDP is 27.0 percent, India’s share is 16.2 percent, the US share is 12.3 percent, and Western Europe’s share is 11.9 percent. Hence, in 2100, the 2100 combined Chinese-Indian global GDP share is 43.2 percent compared with 24.5 percent in 2017. The US and the advanced European nations, which jointly accounted for 33.5 percent of world output in 2017, account for only 24.2 percent in 2100.""Under another possible outcome, the paper explain that if one assumes growth rates are the same as the 20 years before 2017, “India now becomes the planet’s super superpower with its 2100 share of the global economy rising from 6.8% to 33.8%.” It would mean an increase in China’s share of world GDP from 15.7% to 22%. Why is India’s 2100 economy 50 percent larger than China’s under this productivity growth rate assumption? The reason is labour productivity""India’s 2100 population is almost 50 percent larger than China’s. And, by 2100, Indian and Chinese labor productivity are equal. Hence, China’s productivity edge vis a vie India dissipates through time,"" said the report.According to the NBER paper, “productivity growth and its interaction with demographic change are the main drivers of future economic power. Fiscal conditions and automation matter are secondary factors.”. This baseline projection also features “an evolving global savings glut, major reductions in the world interest rate, substantial aging-related increases in tax rates, and permanent differences in regional living standards”.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explained-why-mukesh-ambani-and-gautam-adani-are-bullish-about-indian-economy/articleshow/95729983.cms,0,0.0

An equity injection of this size is expected to help the conglomerate deleverage and Bloomberg Intelligence sees a successful equity raise across the group supporting the companies' dollar bonds.The billionaire is seeking legitimacy in the face of questions about his group's breakneck expansion from a traditional port operator to a sprawling empire with assets including media, cement and green energy, that critics say has boosted leverage and financial complexity. With this fundraising, in one fell swoop Adani can improve debt ratios, broaden his investor base, improve stock liquidity and trigger wider analyst coverage for a conglomerate that's surprisingly under-covered despite the outsized stock gains. ""The fundraising exercise by Adani Group is putting the naysayers in place,"" said Sanjiv Bhasin, director at Mumbai-based brokerage IIFL Securities Ltd. ""He is embarking on a new fund drive that will boost the credibility of the group and allay the fears of investors.""Yet questions remain over what kind of investors Adani will be able to attract, and whether they can be persuaded to buy in at the astronomical valuations his units trade at. The Adani Group declined to comment. 'Lots of questions'Adani executives are courting global sovereign and pension funds, including Mubadala Investment Co, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. The total fundraising size could be as high as $10 billion, according to people familiar with Adani's thinking.The equity plans come as the 60-year-old seeks to reinvent himself on the global stage. Despite adding more billions to his wealth than any other tycoon this year, Adani has struggled to shed the perception that his meteoric rise has been fueled by support from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Research firm CreditSights in September had put the spotlight on the group's ""elevated"" leverage and lawmakers have sought an investigation into some of the group's investors. ""There are a lot of questions about opacity, about lack of disclosures, valuations obviously. But it's trickier because the businesses will grow if India grows,"" said Vikas Pershad, a fund manager at M&G Investments (Singapore) Pte. ""They are at the right place at the right time."" The board of the flagship company, Adani Enterprises Ltd, is meeting on Friday to discuss fund raising options. Adani Enterprises is trading at a valuation of over 160 times its one-year forward earnings. By comparison, Reliance Industries Ltd -- India's largest firm by market value -- is at about 21 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.""Most Adani stocks are highly valued, so investors have to be careful about taking fresh positions,"" said Mohit Nigam, a fund manager with Hem Securities Ltd. in Jaipur. ""Also how they are going to handle debt will be crucial going forward.""Testing appetiteAdani Enterprises was added to India's benchmark Nifty 50 index in September and its equity sale is likely to draw in a number of passive funds. But merely adding more strategic or passive investors is unlikely to increase liquidity, according to Alice Wang, a portfolio manager at Quaero Capital in London, who estimates the company's free float at about 10%, far lower than the reported 27%.""It will be a pity if it's the same strategic holders participating,"" Wang said. ""But as this might solve their problems without putting pressure on their share price, it's a real fait accompli -- great for the banks, jury still out for the equity holders.""A successful outcome for the tycoon would be to pull off something similar to fellow Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, who raised more than $27 billion in 2020 by selling stakes in units of Reliance Industries to global investors of the likes of Meta Platforms Inc. and Google's parent, Alphabet Inc.Anish Teli, managing partner at QED Capital Advisors LLP in Mumbai, said Adani's expected share sale will be the first of many as the conglomerate drives into new industries.The current plans will not just be ""testing appetite for the stock,"" it will also ""pave the way for further fund raises from institutional investors,"" Teli said. ""The group is in various businesses which are cash hungry and have long gestation periods and may need more fundraises soon.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gautam-adani-asias-richest-man-makes-a-5-billion-bet-to-silence-debt-obsessed-critics/articleshow/95753390.cms,2,2.0

The spurt in the sensex came on the back of a Rs 936-crore net buying by foreign funds.The day’s gains did not take into account selling pressure in some of the frontline banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) stocks. Mixed global cues too apparently did not have any impact, which is making a segment of market players cautious. According to Srikanth Subramanian, CEO of Kotak Cherry, an integrated investment platform within the Kotak Group, the recent trend of Indian markets defying global weakness and touching all-time highs is due to renewed interest from foreign funds as the country’s decoupling story continues to play out. “However, one must also realise that as we continue to see better growth rates than the world, our valuations too are priced at those premiums. Even long-term investors at this point should not betray discipline,” Subramanian said.There are analysts who warn that with most Indian stocks looking fully priced and China in the middle of a selloff, 2023 could see several global investors shifting funds from India to China. In such a situation, the domestic market could see sharp corrections next year.On the other side of the spectrum, however, are analysts and strategists who feel that the current bull rally could continue for several months. A report by Morgan Stanley said that its analysts feel there was a 30% chance the sensex would touch the 80,000-point mark by December 2023. From the current market close, that’s a 28% gain in a little more than a year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-closes-at-record-high-for-3rd-day-in-a-row/articleshow/95842277.cms,0,0.0

Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have led to an emergence of rare trade routes for Russian crude and refined products that were mainly sold to European countries. India imported about 410,000 tonnes of naphtha, used for making petrochemicals, in Sept-Oct, the Refinitiv data showed. Of this figure, Reliance received about 150,000 tonnes from the Russian ports of Ust-Luga, Tuapse and Novorossiysk during the two months, the data showed. The private refiner did not buy Russian naphtha in 2020 and 2021. Its annual imports of Russian naphtha were restricted to just one parcel in four years to 2019, the data showed. The data showed a panamax carrier Okyroe sailing towards India laden with about 59,000 tonnes of Russian naphtha. ""With European countries shutting down Russia, they need to find outlets for their naphtha,"" a trader based in India said, referring to Russian firms. Russian naphtha is being sold at lower premiums to countries like India, two Asian naphtha traders said. Reliance, its two plants together capable of processing 1.4 million barrels of oil a day, has emerged as a key buyer of Russian oil since Moscow's February military action in Ukraine. It also buys straight run fuel oil from countries, including Iraq and Russia, to process at cokers in the two refineries in the western Indian state of Gujarat to boost refining margins. Reliance's fuel oil imports from Russia have surged to a record 3 million tonnes since the beginning of this fiscal year in April, versus about 1.6 million for all of 2021/22, Refinitiv data shows. Reliance is expected to receive about 409,000 tonnes of fuel oil in December, the data showed. Reliance did not respond to Reuters emails seeking comments.

Stating that many Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies are keen on starting operations in Maharashtra and they have also received several proposals from these companies, the minister said a big BPO industry will be allotted land in Nashik. “The IT park could not take shape in Nashik due to lack of the IT policy as the previous policy expired around two years ago.

As a working couple, the duo share household responsibilities but she has been disappointed that she has to clean up after her husband who does his bit looking into his smartphone. Smartphones were meant to bring humans closer but are now creating rifts. Marriage counsellors and psychologists TOI spoke to said that almost 75% of the referrals they get these days involve spousal relationships with various issues but smartphone/digital addiction is at the crux of many of them .Further, a survey on Monday by smartphone maker Vivo noted that 88% of respondents said that increased usage of smartphones is hurting their relationship with their spouses, and 67% confess to being engrossed on their phones when spending time with their spouse.With increasing reliance on smartphones to get one's daily jobs done and the proliferation of social media, there is an increase in the hours spent on the device, and this is affecting dynamics of all relationships. Social media is now the primal form of social interaction between people and in-person engagements have taken a backseat.“While some couples acknowledge that the device is creating discord, many go into a defence mechanism mode and say they turn to the smartphone because of certain flaws with their partners,” Saras Bhaskar, a counseling psychologist based in Chennai, says. Bhaskar says that in almost five out of seven referrals today, smartphone use plays a key role in causing trust deficit and insecurities.The respondents to Vivo's survey say they spend an average 4.7 hours per day on their smartphones with women spending marginally more time on the device than men. A large majority of 90% say that immersing themselves into their phones is the most preferred avenue for them for relaxation. In such times, 70% of people get irritated when their spouse asks for something.“It used to be television, work, friends and other distractions. In recent times, phones and tablets have made it easier for partners to numb their minds from the stresses of day-to-day life and the issues in their relationship,"" Dr. Vijay Nagaswami, a psychiatrist and family counsellor, said. ""I would attribute this to the general decrease in attention spans and the need for quick-fixes which make it difficult to engage in the “work” of a relationship or working through an issue,” he added.However, in a silver lining, 68% of partners confess to feeling guilty at times for being distracted by their phone while spending time with their spouse, and 84% of respondents said they wish to spend more quality time with their spouse.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/smartphone-use-creating-marital-discord-survey/articleshow/96212898.cms,1,1.0

The company disputed this and dragged the government to arbitration.For the government, senior advocate A K Ganguli said that an appeal against the Delhi high court singlejudge bench’s decision to reject the government’s bias allegation against two arbitrators is pending in the SC andif the arbitration is rescheduled to January or February “heavens will not fall” and also that this has serious consequences on the public at large.But the bench said, “Heavens will fall if this is the way the government scuttles international arbitration.

A clear improvement in corporate and bank balance sheets, which were under strain prior to the pandemic, is likely to facilitate a steady acceleration in investment in the coming years.Nevertheless, risks remain given dynamics in labour force participation, the lagging rural sector recovery, and uneven reform implementation record, Fitch added.""Fitch Ratings has affirmed India's Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-' with a Stable Outlook,"" the rating agency said in a statement.'BBB-' is the lowest investment grade rating.India enjoyed 'BBB-' rating since an upgrade in August 2006 but the outlook has oscillated between stable and negative. In June this year, Fitch had upped India's rating outlook to 'stable' from 'negative'.Fitch has forecast GDP growth of 7 per cent in the fiscal year ending March 2023 (FY23) on the back of sustained consumption and investment recoveries.""India is somewhat insulated from the gloomy global outlook in 2023, given its modest reliance on external demand. Nevertheless, we expect declining exports, heightened uncertainty and higher interest rates to slow growth to 6.2 per cent in FY24,"" it said.Fitch added that India's rating reflects strengths from a robust growth outlook compared to peers and still-resilient external finances, which have supported the country in navigating the large external shocks during the past year.These are offset by India's weak public finances, illustrated by high deficits and debt relative to peers, as well as lagging structural indicators, including World Bank governance indicators and GDP per capita, it added.Fitch estimates India's debt to GDP ratio to come down to 82.1 per cent this fiscal, from 87.6 per cent in 2020-21.Fitch forecast the current account deficit (CAD) to rise to 3.3 per cent of GDP this fiscal, from 1.2 per cent in the previous year, due to a rising import bill from high commodity prices and robust domestic demand, and declining exports.

If the devices that do that, electrolysers, a","NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet has approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission to promote green hydrogen in a bid to cut emissions and become a major exporter in the field. The move is aimed at making India the global hub for the production of green hydrogen and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.What is green hydrogen? How does it differ from traditional emissions-intensive ‘grey’ hydrogen and blue hydrogen?According to Dr Emanuele Taibi, Head of the Power Sector Transformation Strategies, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Hydrogen is the simplest and smallest element in the periodic table. No matter how it is produced, it ends up with the same carbon-free molecule. However, the pathways to produce it are very diverse, and so are the emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).Hydrogen, made by splitting water with an electrical process called electrolysis, can be used as a fuel. If the devices that do that, electrolysers, are powered by renewable energy, the product is called green hydrogen.""Grey hydrogen is traditionally produced from methane (CH4), split with steam into CO2 – the main culprit for climate change – and H2, hydrogen. Grey hydrogen has increasingly been produced also from coal, with significantly higher CO2 emissions per unit of hydrogen produced, so much that is often called brown or black hydrogen instead of grey,"" said Taibi.Blue hydrogen follows the same process as grey, said Taibi with the additional technologies necessary to capture the CO2 produced when hydrogen is split from methane (or from coal) and store it for long term. It is not one colour but rather a very broad gradation, as not 100% of the CO2 produced can be captured, and not all means of storing it are equally effective in the long term. 96756054So, unlike grey hydrogen which uses natural gas, green hydrogen is produced by the electrolysis of water using renewable energy and thus doesn't emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The carbon intensity ultimately depends on the carbon neutrality of the source of electricity (i.e., the more renewable energy there is in the electricity fuel mix, the “greener” the hydrogen produced.Green hydrogen can cut dependency on fossil fuels, as the global market for the clean alternative is slated to be worth almost $60 billion.What is the free hydrogen mission in India?The National Hydrogen Mission was launched on August 15, 2021, with a view to cutting down carbon emissions and increasing the use of renewable sources of energy. The mission seeks to promote the development of green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 MMT (Million Metric Tonnes) per annum with an associated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW in the country by 2030.What is the latest development?In what could be a big step towards achieving India’s updated climate action goals, the government on Wednesday approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission with initial financial outlay of Rs 19,744 crore. It will help India in not only reducing its carbon footprint but also saving a substantial amount of foreign exchange on import of fossil fuels in due course.The mission will eventually help the country become energy independent while taking a big leap towards decarbonisation of major sectors of the economy as part of its long-term goal of carbon neutrality by 2070.It is expected that the mission would help India in abating nearly 50 million metric tonnes of annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emission by 2030 in sync with India’s updated climate action pledge under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions intensity (emission per unit of its GDP) by 45% by 2030 from 2005 level.The ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) will formulate the guidelines for implementation of the different components of the Mission.The components of the mission include an outlay of Rs 17,490 crore for the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition Programme (SIGHT), Rs 1,466 crore for pilot projects, Rs 400 crore for R&D, and Rs 388 crore towards other related initiatives. The allocation is expected to attract huge investments and encourage R&D, focussed on electrolysers, in the next few years.In all, the mission envisages an investment of over Rs 8 lakh crore and creation of over 6 lakh jobs by 2030.It will also result in a cumulative reduction in fossil fuel imports of over Rs 1 lakh crore and abatement of nearly 50 MMT of annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.The mission will have wide-ranging benefits — creation of export opportunities for green hydrogen and its derivatives; decarbonisation of industrial, mobility and energy sectors; reduction in dependence on imported fossil fuels and feedstock; development of indigenous manufacturing capabilities; creation of employment opportunities; and development of cutting-edge technologies.The mission will also support pilot projects in emerging end-use sectors and production pathways. Regions capable of supporting large-scale production and/or utilisation of hydrogen will be identified and developed as Green Hydrogen Hubs, the Minister added.Further, a public-private partnership framework for R&D (Strategic Hydrogen Innovation Partnership - SHIP) will be facilitated under the mission. R&D projects will be goal-oriented, time-bound, and suitably scaled up to develop globally competitive technologies. A coordinated skill development programme will also be undertaken.Green Hydrogen Production in India: How competitive can it be?According to Niti Ayogya, green hydrogen prices are determined largely by the cost of electrolysers and electricity. Beyond that, there are the operating costs, transmission and distribution (T&D) costs, and wheeling charges for electricity as well as specific local duties and taxes like the goods and services tax (GST) in India.""The cost of hydrogen from electrolysis today is relatively high, between around $7/kg and $4.10/kg depending on various technology choices and the associated soft costs. This makes it hard to compete with the existing cost of grey or brown hydrogen. But India has some of the most competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar and wind in the world while remaining a net importer of natural gas. Given the promises of electrolyser cost and LCOE decline, it is more beneficial to expand green hydrogen production in India rather than production of grey or blue hydrogen,"" the Niti Ayogya paper on Harnessing Green Hydrogen said.India’s distinct advantage in terms of low-cost renewable electricity, complemented by rapidly falling electrolyser prices, can enable green hydrogen to be not just economical compared to fossil-fuel based hydrogen but also compared to the green hydrogen being produced around the globe. Adoption of green hydrogen can enable India to abate 3.6 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions cumulatively between now and 2050.""Now, India has the advantage of low cost. The cost of green hydrogen in the country is expected to fall to about one-fourth of global levels. At about US$1 per kg, India could become the lowest-cost producer in the world...but a shift to green hydrogen as a new renewable source won't happen in a hurry, as energy transitions, in general, take a long time,"" said Tanushree Banerjee Editor, StockSelect Equitymaster Agora Research Private Limited.According to the report, India can target the following areas to make a successful transition to green hydrogen• Both near-term and long-term policy pathways to reduce the cost of green hydrogen need to be encouraged to enable cost competitiveness against alternatives.• A cost-competitive green hydrogen is bound to lead to market creation. But the government can also encourage near-term market development by identifying industrial clusters and enacting associated viability gap funding and mandates.• An emerging green hydrogen economy means opportunities around research and development and manufacturing of components such as electrolysers and fuel cells, crucial to enabling the industry to develop and scale.• A globally competitive green hydrogen industry also leads to prospects of exports of green hydrogen and hydrogen- embedded low-carbon products such as green ammonia and green steel.The importance of green hydrogen Green hydrogen can achieve cost parity with natural gas-based hydrogen (grey hydrogen) by 2030, if not before. Beyond cost, since hydrogen is only as clean as its source of generation, green hydrogen will be necessary to achieve a truly low-carbon economy. It will also enable the emergence of a domestically produced energy carrier that can reduce the dependence on imports for key commodities like natural gas and petroleum.What are the major sops being provided by the government for green hydrogen?  India plans to build electrolyser capacity of 60-100 gigawatts to help produce green hydrogen.The incentive by the government aims to make green hydrogen affordable and bring down its production cost, currently at Rs 300 to Rs 400 per kg.Grey hydrogen costs around Rs 200 per kg to produce as gas costs have pushed the prices from Rs 130 per kg. To promote the use of green hydrogen, mandatory targets for green hydrogen consumption — would be required of fertiliser units, petroleum refineries and city gas distribution networks.The government has allowed concessional green electricity, waiver of inter-state transmission charges, land at renewable energy parks and mega manufacturing zones for promoting green hydrogen and green ammonia. India also plans to introduce a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to encourage the manufacturing of electrolyzers. The plan is to target lower costs of renewable power generation and to bring down the costs of electrolysers to make the production of green hydrogen cost-competitive so that this fuel could replace fossil fuels and fossil fuel-based feedstocks in fertiliser production, petroleum refining, steel production, and transport applications.Which companies stand to gain? Reliance Industries, Indian Oil, NTPC, Adani Enterprises, JSW Energy and Acme Solar have big plans on green hydrogen. Reliance Industries aims to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen to under $1/kg by the end of this decade while billionaire Gautam Adani has stated that Adani Group aspires to be among the biggest producers of green hydrogen in the world.State-owned NTPC on January 3, said it has commissioned India's first green hydrogen blending project. The green hydrogen blending has been started in the piped natural gas (PNG) network of NTPC Kawas township, Surat. The project is a joint effort of NTPC and Gujarat Gas Ltd (GGL).Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is targeting to replace at least a tenth of its current fossil-fuel-based hydrogen at its refineries with carbon-free green hydrogen as part of a decarbonization drive. It has set up green hydrogen plants at its Panipat and Mathura refineries. While renewable energy plants currently produce electricity equivalent to 5 per cent of its electricity consumption, IOC is targeting nearly 5 GW of renewable electricity generation capacities by 2025 for use at its oil refineries.Three factors to keep in mind before investing in green hydrogen stocksAccording to Equitymaster's Banerjee, here are three factors you must keep in mind before you decide to load up on green hydrogen stocks.Cost of Electrolyser: Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using an electrolyser. One million tonne of green hydrogen corresponds to around 11-13 GW of electrolyser capacity. According to NITI Aayog, at present, the cost of hydrogen production through electrolysis ranges from US$ 4-10 per kg based on the technology used. With a price decline for both electrolysers and renewables, NITI Aayog expects the cost of green hydrogen to fall to approximately US$2 per kg by 2030 and US$0.7 per kg by 2050.The government recently approved incentives of Rs 170 bn to be allotted for electrolyser and green hydrogen manufacturing in the country. Companies using the incentives for mass scale production could certainly compete on cost.Water availability: For producing 1 kg of hydrogen, 9 kg of water as input is required. Accordingly, a large-scale (1 GW) electrolyser, producing 0.15 million tonne of hydrogen, would consume about 3 million tonne of water. Hence shortage of water can be a key hindrance in green hydrogen manufacturing.Combustibility: Its flammability and its lightness mean that hydrogen, like other fuels, needs to be properly handled. Many fuels are flammable. Compared to gasoline, natural gas, and propane, hydrogen is more flammable in the air. A concern is the higher energy content of hydrogen poses risks as auto fuel. Auto fuels are highly flammable. A vehicle laden with hydrogen will be more vulnerable in case of a major accident. Hydrogen stations will need to adapt to more stringent safety measures. In other words, the technology for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles needs to be far superior in terms of safety. However, the risk of combustibility of hydrogen fuel cells is almost as much as is lithium cells. Hence companies that use technology to mitigate such risks need to be monitored.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explained-what-is-green-hydrogen-and-indias-national-mission-to-cut-emissions-/articleshow/96755832.cms,2,2.0

Medicines, boosters and diagnostics — key ammo for fighting Covid — are in the spotlight once again.  96842597Additionally, a focus on quality will dominate the agenda for pharma companies in the wake of recent deaths of children in Gambia and Uzbekistan, potentially due to adulterated cough syrups, industry experts told TOI. The year 2022 had started with the country rolling out booster shots as the Omicron variant became dominant. Pharma companies prepared for the surge, built up huge stocks of key medicines, and launched oral antiviral pills. Thereafter, once the caseload reduced, they got back to boosting non-Covid portfolios and brand-building. “Pandemic planning is back in the spotlight in the wake of concerns around the spread of Covid in certain countries. Also, the China-plus-one strategy has become important with frequent disruptions, geopolitical issues and emphasis on self-reliance,” said Sujay Shetty, global health industries advisory leader at PwC India. Zydus Lifesciences chairman Pankaj Patel told TOI, “Despite supply chain challenges due to the surge in demand of certain drugs multiple times in a short period, the industry was able to ensure consistent supplies. Also, vaccine development and supply for the mass vaccination programme proved India is ‘Atma Nirbhar’.” Regarding the year ahead, Patel said, “In 2023, the industry is confident of tackling healthcare challenges, if the situation occurs again. It is by no means a small achievement that India today is the only country which has therapies approved for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which are unmet healthcare needs. Also, there is work being done on rare and orphan diseases, which have no treatment as of today, globally”Quality and innovation will be a core topic for the industry. Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance’s secretary general Sudarshan Jain summed up the main themes as innovation, quality, expanding global reach to Japan, China & Latin America, and self-reliance. “A focus on quality and in particular USFDA requirements will also dominate the agenda,” Shetty added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/pharma-sector-to-focus-on-supply-chain-covid-mgmt/articleshow/96842234.cms,0,1.0

The sensex gained 1.4% to close at 60,747 points. The Nifty too gained 1.4%, or 242 points, to close at 18,101.The rally on Wall Street came on the back of a set of economic data that raised expectations that the US Federal Reserve, the country’s central bank, may not raise rates as aggressively as it did in the past few months. This led to a global rally in stocks.As a result, of the 30 sensex constituents, 27 closed with gains. Interestingly foreign funds were strong sellers of Indian stocks with a net outflow worth Rs 203 crore, BSE data showed. Domestic funds, on the other hand, were net buyers at Rs 1,724 crore. The day’s rally also added Rs 3.3 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 285.5 lakh crore.According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, domestic equities saw some support-based buying after witnessing selling pressure last week, largely helped by a rally in global markets. Except stocks from consumer durables space, buying was visible across sectors with IT, metals, PSU banks and auto being top gainers. “Expectation of the US Fed turning less hawkish and opening of remaining Covid-related border controls by both Hong Kong and China uplifted investors’ sentiments.”Technically, the Nifty has to be above 18,000-18,050 zone for the current rally to sustain, Samco Securities technical analyst Rohan Patil wrote in a post-market note. This could take the index towards the 18,250-18,300 zone, whereas support for the Nifty is placed at 17,800, Patil wrote.Going forward, investors will also keep an eye on US, Europe and India’s inflation data, expected during the week, Khemka said. “Further, Fed chair Jerome Powell’s speech on Tuesday will be important for global markets as it could throw some light for future action.”Some other dealers also expect the quarterly earnings numbers by some of the large companies, expected over the next two weeks, would also impact the market’s trend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-up-847-points-as-global-indices-rally-on-us-eco-data/articleshow/96868982.cms,0,0.0

With the upcoming commercialisation of Vindhya basin and rich CBM resources, the state is all set to make a mark on the energy map of India. Public health engineering principal secretary Sanjay Kumar Shukla said Madhya Pradesh offers immense opportunities for gas distribution and networking along with growing industrial ecosystem, growing population and urbanisation. Shukla said ONGC well in Damoh, on testing has produced natural gas over 62044 cubic meters/day. This confirms production potential of Proterozoic basin – first time in India.There are huge prospects in setting up CNG bottling station, he said adding opportunities also exist for direct marketing to industries and cluster-based gas prediction through cascade systems.Madhya Pradesh has country’s 9% coal reserves with 7.7 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of prognosticated CBM resource (total 91.8TCF) and 3.64 TCF of established CBM reserves. At present, two CBM blocks – Sohagpur East and West are under production. In special CBM bid round in 2021, two blocks were allotted in Sohagpur and Chhindwara, he said adding “Investment from existing and new blocks is expected to be around Rs 10,000 crore.”He said Madhya Pradesh has a large network of petroleum product pipeline which is helpful in setting-up ancillary industrial activities. “Madhya Pradesh is making continuous efforts for well-planned and smooth exploitation of natural resources available here to ensure India's energy security and energy self-reliance,” the principal secretary said. He spoke about abundant availability of raw material in the state in the ethanol blending sector and the concessions, subsidies and incentives provided to investors and industrial institutions.

India imports 85 per cent of its crude oil, which is converted into petrol and diesel, and roughly half of its natural gas is converted to CNG and used in industries.Speaking at the Voice of Global South Summit, Puri said the government has targeted to increase the geographical area under exploration and production to 0.5 million square kilometres or 15 per cent by 2025 from the current 0.25 million sq km.""We are expecting an investment of around $58 billion in exploration and production (of oil and gas) by 2023,"" he said.

""We are witnessing extreme price volatility in energy molecules. The most acute impact of this is felt in the global south.""Despite these challenging circumstances, the government has taken several measures to maintain energy security for its citizens.These include diversification of supplies, an increase of alternate energy sources like bio-fuels, ethanol, and compressed biogas, increasing E&P footprint along with a focus on domestic production; and meeting energy targets through EVs and Hydrogen.""All these measures offer easy replication for achieving our respective energy security goals,"" he said.India, he said, has increased the ethanol blending in petrol from 1.53 per cent in 2013-14 to 10.17 per cent in 2022, which was well ahead of the November 2022 deadline and advanced its target to achieve 20 per cent ethanol blending in petrol from 2030 to 2025-26.""To resolve the common concerns of the global south, India is proposing to create Global Biofuel Alliance under G20,"" he said.""The aim of the Alliance is to support projects in order to increase the deployment of biofuels and its related technology, offer alternate means of sustainable energy and finally move to its trading among the largest producers and consumers of biofuels.""E20 or petrol blended with 20 per cent ethanol, will be rolled out soon in 11 states and UTs much earlier than the initial target date of April 1, 2023.

It sought a stay on the ‘challenge mechanism’ scheduled for January 19. On Wednesday, the counsel for the administrator and committee of creditors (CoC) stated before the NCLT that the fresh auction for sale would be held on January 23, as hearing of the challenge may not get over before January 19.On Thursday, senior counsel Darius Khambata for Torrent was rejoining to submissions made by a bevy of senior counsel including Kapil Sibal for the CoC, Ravi Kadam, A M Singhvi and Harish Salve who all sought dismissal of the application. Torrent’s other senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi suggested that any fresh auction be deferred by the Tribunal for a week from Monday, to give breathing time to either side to challenge the outcome of its plea, if matter is reserved for orders by Friday.Senior counsel Kapil Sibal for the CoC and Kadam for the administrator interjected and opposed. Sibal said, “Am objecting. The mechanism must go on.’’ The NCLT bench of also said to Rohatgi, “you will be notified when we are ready with the order.’’Salve appearing for Hinduja, another bidder, whose bid was higher than Torrent’s, but also considered to be “sub optimal’’ as it was below the cut off liquidation value, said “If CoC feels in its commercial wisdom that the fresh auction will general more money, it has to be allowed. The Tribunal cannot interdict at this stage.’’Opposing Torrent’s plea Sibal said the “whole process has been stymied contrary to the court’’. He urged the Tribunal to declare Torrent’s application as “non maintainable’’, also premature, and to dismiss it saying, “CoC be allowed to proceed in accordance with court and law.’’Salve for Indus International Holdings ( Hinduja group company ) said the “purpose of the insolvency court is not to create an avenue for lucrative investment. The company belonging to a group of shareholders is not a largesse of the government to be distributed. And therefore all these notions saying you cannot have multiple biddings…is completely misconceived.’’ Salve submitted, “Unless there is an express statutory bar, the general principle of whether or not to accept a resolution plan at all must lie with the CoC, or administrator or Resolution Professional as the case may be.’’ Salve added later, “Public monies have been given to a corporate debtor and public monies have to come in, Torrent cannot enrich itself at the cost of the Indian tax payer.’’Khambata in rejoinder began by saying Sibal and Salve argued that its plea was premature, and asked how on December 23, the administrator said the plan was unfair to Torrent. Khambata said, “a new process is a wipe out.’’ The NCLT asked Khambata to continue and conclude on Friday and posted the matter high on board.The controversy arose after a Hinduja entity’s bid higher by Rs 300 crore than Torrent’s but allegedly made after the bid deadline. Torrent challenged the late bid by Hinduja and said its bid ought to be accepted as the winning bid.The CoC felt there was greater value to the asset of Reliance Capital and decided to proceed with a fresh round.The Administrator appointed was Nageswara Rao Y.

So far, Netmeds, the e-pharmacy chain majority controlled by Reliance Retail, has focused on the online sale and delivery of medicines. Interestingly, the move comes on the heels of discount supermarket chain Dmart announcing plans to set up pharmacies within its stores. Reliance Retail plans to open over 2,000 standalone pharmacy stores in a year, with the first outlet having been opened in Chennai recently, sources told TOI. Most of India’s over eight lakh retail pharmacies are small, independent businesses, and majorly concentrated in metros, tier-1 and -2 cities. The aggressive expansion by biggies like Apollo, and e-commerce platforms like Netmeds, Tata 1mg, Amazon and Flipkart Health+ could pose serious competition for the brick-and-mortar pharmacies, experts say. E-pharmacies including Tata 1mg and Pharmeasy are understood to be experimenting with offline stores for an omni-channel play. An email sent to Reliance Retail went unanswered.

The Rs 59,000 crore deal with France for 36 Rafale fighters, which was inked in September 2016, does not figure in this list.Bhatt, on his part, said, “The Defence Acquisition Procedure-2020 with a focus on `Atmanirbhar Bharat’ and `Make in India’ introduced major policy initiatives for boosting indigenous defence capability and reduction of reliance on imports.”“Further, DAP-2020 provides the highest preference to Buy Indian (IDDM) category of acquisition and Buy Global is only permitted in exceptional situations with specific approval of the Defence Acquisitions Council or the defence minister,” he added.97431129 In a separate answer, Bhatt said the DRDO is working on 55 `mission mode’ projects at a total sanctioned cost of Rs 73,943 crore.

The Ashok Leyland manufactured truck with two large hydrogen cylinders was put up at a hall adjacent to the main venue where Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the three-day event that is themed around 'Growth, Collaboration, Transition'.  A display near the truck said this was ""India's 1st H2ICE technology truck on road.""  The truck has ""near-zero emissions"" when it uses hydrogen as fuel in place of conventional diesel or even recently introduced liquefied natural gas (LNG).  ""H2ICE vehicle performance on-par with diesel ICE,"" it said.  H2 is the formula for hydrogen and ICE stands for internal combustion engine.  India is fast pushing for use of hydrogen, which can be produced by splitting water using electricity. Use of electricity generated from renewable sources such as solar and wind qualifies it to be green hydrogen.  Hydrogen finds wide applicability, from refineries to steel plants and fertilizer units where it can replace hydrocarbons. Hydrogen can also be used as fuel in automobiles but its current cost of manufacturing is very high. But this hasn't stopped companies from investing in hydrogen manufacturing.  Last month, billionaire Gautam Adani's group announced plans for a hydrogen truck.  In January, Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL), part of the diversified Adani portfolio of companies, signed an agreement to launch a pilot project to develop a hydrogen fuel cell electric truck (FCET) for mining logistics and transportation with Ashok Leyland, India, and Ballard Power, Canada.  The hydrogen powered mining truck will weigh 55 tons, have three hydrogen tanks, a 200-km working range, and will be powered by Ballard's 120 kW PEM fuel cell technology.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBFBgbSREZw The Adani Group had previously announced its plans to invest more than USD 50 billion over the next 10 years in green hydrogen and associated ecosystems corresponding to a capacity of up to 3 million tons of green hydrogen annually.  The oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance too is pivoting a green path, investing in renewable energy power generation as well as the entire hydrogen ecosystem as part of its decarbonisation plans.  Reliance is investing Rs 6 lakh crore (USD 80 billion) in multiple green energy projects in Gujarat as part of the company's increasingly ambitious decarbonisation drive.  It will invest Rs 5 lakh crore over the span of 10 to 15 years to set up 100 GW renewable-energy power plant and green-hydrogen ecosystem development. It has started the process of scouting land for 100 GW renewable energy power projects in Kutch, Banaskantha and Dholera, and has requested 450,000 acres of land in Kutch.  The company will spend an additional Rs 60,000 crore in setting up 'new energy manufacturing', which includes solar modules, electrolysers, batteries for energy storage and fuel cells.  Another Rs 25,000 crore will be invested in existing projects and new ventures in the next three to five years.  Reliance in 2021 first talked of a multi-billion investment plan spanning renewables, storage and hydrogen, including what it claims will be the world's largest green energy equipment 'giga-complex' and a 100GW capacity goal.  The investment over three years would propel Reliance to net-zero emissions status by 2035.  At the display alongside the hydrogen truck, Reliance said use of hydrogen results in 20 per cent fuel operating expense saving over diesel ICE vehicles. It also results in 10-15 per cent noise reduction over diesel ICE vehicles, it added.  Adani Group plans to invest USD 20 billion over the next decade in renewable-energy generation and component manufacturing, with an aim to become ""the producer of the least expensive green electron anywhere in the world"".  It intends to triple its renewable-power generation capacity over the next four years, become a green-hydrogen producer, power all of its data centres by renewable energy by 2030, achieve net-zero emissions at its ports by 2025, and allocate more than 75 per cent of capital expenditure up to 2025 on green technologies.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/news/reliance-showcases-hydrogen-run-truck-at-india-energy-week/articleshow/97640660.cms,2,2.0

India’s first hydrogen-powered truck was flagged off by PM Narendra Modi in Bengaluru at India Energy Week. The flagship company of Hinduja Group, Ashok Leyland and Reliance Industries, India’s leading commercial vehicle manufacturer, were working on H2-ICE technology over the past year. The heavy-duty truck has been under testing since August 2022. The Ashok Leyland H2-ICE truck range is powered by Hydrogen, maintaining overall architecture similar to a conventional diesel-based combustion engine. With a loading capacity of 19-35 tons, the H2-ICE heavy-duty truck helps quick migration to cleaner energy at relatively lower cost delta, says the official statement. “Working with RIL, we have once again demonstrated our technological leadership, and our commitment to the Clean Mobility Mission,” says Dr. N Saravanan, President and Chief Technology Officer, Ashok Leyland. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGBHa8DXOEkFurther, he added, “Our aim is to make India’s alternate fuel segment self-reliant and be one of the flag bearers of the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ campaign”. The H2-ICE technology seems to be promising for clean mobility; however, the cost is high owing to limited hydrogen fuel availability.

Payments vary from cargo to cargo, depending in part on the demands of specific traders, said the people, who requested anonymity as the details are private. Reliance, BPCL and Nayara didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The European Union’s recent ban on imports of refined oil products from Russia has positioned India as an increasingly important customer for the shipments. Russia has been India’s top crude supplier since June as cargoes previously bound for Europe have been diverted to Asia — often sold at well below the $60-a-barrel cap.97747820The UAE dirham provides both Indian buyers and Russian sellers with a relatively predictable currency — pegged to the dollar — without the greenback’s potential sanctions complications. Even on deals that don’t directly violate US and EU restrictions, some intermediary banks often take additional steps to avoid any risks to other banking relationships abroad.India is the UAE’s second-largest trade partner and officials are working on a mechanism to boost trade in dirhams and rupees. Most oil deals are still being transacted in dollars. India’s oil minister said he was unaware of the use of dirham in oil purchases. “If you are asking me officially am I in the know of these payment channels, no, I’m not,” Hardeep Singh Puri said in a Monday interview in Bengaluru. Officials are open to holding discussion with other countries on the issue, he said. “If the need arises, we will need to talk.”India is probably willing to accommodate requests from Russia to offer payment in dirham, considering the bargain prices offered on crude, according to Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights.

Companies like Bank of Baroda and CG Power have been added, while Biocon has been crossed off the list.Market analysts anticipate that CG Power will experience a sizable inflow of capital as a result of its inclusion in the MSCI Global Standard Index. They expect a weightage of 0.27%, indicating that CG Power will comprise a small but meaningful portion of the index, as well as an inflow of $161 million, which is nearly 12 times its 20-day average daily volume. Bank of Baroda's inclusion in the MSCI Global Standard Index is expected to result in a significant influx of capital into the company. The expected weightage of 0.24% would indicate that Bank of Baroda would make up a small but meaningful portion of the index, and the estimated inflow of $145 million would be substantial relative to the company's average daily trading volume.The removal of Biocon from the MSCI Global Standard Index is expected to result in a significant outflow of capital from the company. The expected weightage reduction of 0.14% would imply that Biocon would no longer constitute a significant portion of the index, as would the estimated outflow of $68 million, which is nearly 11 times its 20-day average trading volume.However, On Adani Group stocks, MSCI has reduced the weightage of four Adani Group companies in its quarterly review, which is likely to impact the market capitalization of these companies. MSCI stated that certain investors in the Adani Group companies might not be considered as public investors, which has led to a reduction in the free float market capitalization.The reduction in weightage of Adani Group stocks by 0.82 basis points is expected to result in a significant outflow of capital from the company. According to analysts, the outflow of $428 million could be substantial, although this amount is lower than what was expected by the market a day before the announcement was made.It has to be noted that, none of the Adani stocks that are a part of the MSCI index have been removed from the index, it's just a reduction of weightage that has happened in the Adani Group companies. Now for Adani Enterprises, they are expecting the weight to reduce by around 0.3 basis points, which could lead to an outflow of $161 million U, which is nearly 0.6 times its 20-day average volume. In case of Adani Transmission and Adani Total Gas, the weightage is coming off by around 0.2 - 0.3 basis points and the outflow expected is close to $110–$145 million. Additionally, for ACC, the weightage is coming off by only 0.02 basis points, which would lead to an outflow of only $12 million, which is just 0.3 times its 20-day average daily volume. The weightage of stocks such as Reliance Industries, HDFC, Infosys, ICICI Bank, and TCS has increased. The weighting has increased by approximately 0.04 to 0.1 basis points. Apart from that, MSCI has added nearly 25 Indian companies to their MSCI Global Small Cap indexes. Some of them include GR Infraprojects, Spandana Sphoorty Finance, Techno Electric & Engineering, and Ion Exchange India. All of these stocks have been actively traded, and the Global Small Cap indexes now list their names.

The project aims to conduct 1,00,000 Artificial Inseminations annually and establish 400 new commercial farms every year.The project also focuses on clusterization, creation of mandis, abattoirs and common facility centers (CFCs), to support marketing and value addition of the sector, he said.The existing mutton production is not only of insufficient quantity but also lacks quality and is not FSSAI compliant, putting consumers at risk.The majority of the livestock population is held by Bakerwals who follow traditional methods of farming, resulting in low productivity and profits.The UT has less than five breeds of sheep with the majority being dual purpose breeds such as Kashmir Merino, Rambouillet, and Corriedale. However, there is increasing demand for fast-growing mutton breeds like Dorper, Romnov, South Down and others, they said.The expected output from the project include import of 2700 high genetic merit and elite sheep and goats, increased lambing percentage from 80 to 120 and considerable reduction in marketable age for sheep and goats (40-50 kg in 6 months), they officials said.The project aims to double the farm income through early weight gain, improved carcass yield and production and reduce lamb mortality. Effective health cover is expected to prevent production losses by 20-30 percent and provide consumers with safe and quality meat, they said.""The project is anticipated to bring significant benefits to farmers and consumers in Jammu and Kashmir. The creation of commercial farms and establishment of breed-based farms will boost mutton production and improve the quality of meat available to consumers"", Dulloo said.The marketing and value addition initiatives will help farmers get better returns for their produce, while health cover and nutrition interventions will reduce production losses and improve the overall well-being of the animals.The project will also create job opportunities and promote entrepreneurship, contributing to the economic development of the region, they said.

But neither are they about to collapse in a heap of governance failures.”In its January 24 report, short seller Hindenburg Research alleged accounting fraud and stock manipulation by Gautam Adani, triggering a stock rout at the billionaire empire, wiping out $127 billion off the group’s market value. Adani has repeatedly denied the accusations.It has a relatively low proportion of freely-tradeable shares, which means excessive control by founders that led to rich valuations, the economists said. It also has one of the lowest liquidity ratios among peers, they added. Its flagship firm Adani Enterprises Ltd is covered by just two analysts, against an average of 33 for the 50 biggest companies, according to the report. Though the group is highly leveraged compared to peers, its profits are sufficient to cover interest expenses, it said. The crisis has raised questions about India’s credibility as a global growth engine and a destination for international investors. Earlier this month, MSCI reduced the free float of four companies owned by Adani, while Moody’s Investors Service cut its outlook on Adani Green Energy and three other group firms.“Short sellers likely won’t be dominating the narrative on India Inc in years ahead,” the economists said. “With India’s GDP once again set to outperform, the country’s firms will have a chance to take another step on the path from national champions to global majors.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gautam-adani-crisis-likely-to-leave-indias-conglomerates-unscathed/articleshow/97901011.cms,1,1.5

The paper proposes that when ESG schemes of fund houses vote on resolutions at the annual general meetings of their investee companies, they need to disclose if they had voted in favour of the resolution or against it based on ESG parameters. The new rule could come into effect from fiscal 2024, the paper proposed.Sebi has mandated the top 1,000 listed companies by market cap to make filings under the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) from FY23. In FY22, more than 175 companies reported on the BRSR framework on a voluntary basis. “With the BRSR becoming mandatory from this financial year and a number of stakeholders such as investors and ESG rating providers placing reliance on disclosures made in the BRSR, assurance becomes key for enhancing credibility of disclosure and investor confidence,” Sebi said in its paper. Another area where more visibility and transparency is required is ESG disclosures by supply chain participants of companies, it added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sebi-moots-stricter-esg-disclosures-by-mfs/articleshow/98108802.cms,2,2.0

As a result, the Sensex sank by 928 points, the biggest fall in the year so far. After a relatively flat start, the index dived deeper into the red and closed at 59,745 points, down 1.5% on the day with all but one of its 30 constituents - ITC - closing down.A fresh selloff in Adani stocks, along with relentless offloading by foreign funds, also weighed on investor sentiment, market players said.98166693In the last two weeks, a series of strong economic data in the US, the world's largest economy, have raised expectations among economists and analysts that the American central bank will again raise interest rates aggressively in the next few months. This has been weighing on investor sentiment globally which led to a nearly 3% fall in the Dow Jones and other leading Wall Street indices on Tuesday.According to Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, while some of the key US macro data pointed towards a stronger economy, inflation continued to remain stubbornly higher. As a result, ""there is an increasing fear that the US Fed may remain hawkish for a longer duration than expected, which may even force the RBI to keep interest rates high"". In addition to these, statements from both Russian and US Presidents led to some increase in geopolitical tensions, which added to the current uncertainty in the markets, Khemka said in a note.The day's slide also left investors poorer by Rs 4 lakh crore with the BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 264.6 lakh crore. Among the Sensex constituents, Reliance Industries contributed the most to the index's loss, followed by HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.

In September 2018, she delivered twin boys at 30 weeks’ gestation after an emergency C-section. They were admitted to NICU for life-saving treatment. The coverage for newborn babies “for any illness or injury” was introduced in the same year in the policies without additional premium.Joshi made a claim for Rs 11 lakh, but it was repudiated saying it does not cover premature babies. She moved HC, with her advocate Ashok Shetty arguing the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) has defined ‘newborn baby’ to mean a baby born during the policy period and up to 90 days in age. The judges rejected the insurer’s reliance on three doctors’ opinion that complications developed in the twins due to their premature birth and would not usually occur in a baby born full term. They also junked a bid to make a distinction between expenses for a newborn’s illness or injury and expenses relating to premature babies, pointing out an injury could result from a baby being born premature or preterm. “The further distinction between a ‘newborn’ and a ‘premature baby’ or a baby born ‘pre-term’ is also baseless as a newborn baby can be one born ‘full term’ or ‘pre-term’. A full-term baby does not become more ‘newer’ any more than a ‘pre-term’ baby becomes an ‘earlier born’ or, to make it even more pointed, ‘old born’,” Justice Neela Gokhale wrote for the bench. The judges said New India’s approach is unreasonable, unjust and contrary to the fundamental utmost good faith ethic of an insurance provider. “These submissions are the sheerest casuistry (excuse). They cannot be allowed to succeed,” said the judgment, directing that Rs 11 lakh be paid with interest from December 2018, the date of claim, till the actual amount is paid to Joshi.The judges noted that it took the young mother and professional a “roller-coaster litigation” process to bring the matter to its logical end. “The petitioner mother had not even had the time to revel in the birth of her twin babies and nurse them to health when she faced the rude shock of rejection of her legitimate claim/s by the insurance company,” they said. The bench directed the insurer to also pay Joshi Rs 5 lakh as cost of litigation, “prompted in addition by its defiance in obeying the directives of its regulator”. They directed all amounts to be paid within four weeks.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-insurers-act-unjust-against-good-faith-ethic/articleshow/98349669.cms,1,1.5

The steps have been taken to make metro most environment-friendly, provide power supply to the stations and reduce carbon footprint.On the lines of Delhi metro model, the Patna metro has planned to use solar power energy for auxiliary services at the stations, like elevators, escalators, lighting, signalling, telecommunication, firefighting and fare collection system.The Patna Metro Rail Corporation spokesperson said considering the futuristic technology and potential for solar power generation, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (DMRC), the nodal agency of the Patna metro project, will implement rooftop grid-connected solar power panels at selected locations of elevated stations and maintenance depot. “The solar panels installed on the rooftop of the metro stations will generate clean and green energy, which will aid constant power supply at Patna metro stations,” he said.The solar panels will generate approximately 6.5 megawatts of electricity per day. Different sheds and buildings of the establishment are proposed to be used for solar photovoltaic (SPV) installation to optimize the solar energy potential. The requirement of power at each elevated station is expected to be 200kW-300kW and for each underground station 1500kW-2000kW. According to officials, the solar power will be transferred to the underground stations from depot, proposed near the Patliputra Bus Terminal.“This initiative for Patna metro will not only reduce the reliance on non-renewable sources of energy but is also in line with the central government’s target of achieving 50% cumulative electric power from renewable resources by 2030 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. This initiative is also in line with the measures suggested by Bihar Renewable Energy Development Agency (BREDA) towards adopting sustainable construction practices,” the officials said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/solar-panels-on-all-metro-rail-buildings-depot/articleshow/98378566.cms,2,2.0

China has also been buying ESPO at above the price cap level, according to Reuters calculations.Indian companies are using non-dollar currencies to settle payment for certain niche Russian crudes and are avoiding use of Western services and banks to avoid sanctions.Competition from India has narrowed discounts for April-loading ESPO shipments to about $6.80 a barrel against June ICE Brent DES basis to northern China from $8.50 a barrel last month for March-loading oil, three trading sources said.Similar quality Murban crude from Abu Dhabi was traded at a premium of around $3.30 a barrel to Dubai quotes on a free-on-board basis.In comparison, April-loading Murban crude is about $9 a barrel more expensive than ESPO delivered to China and India, according to Reuters calculations.Seaborne ESPO crude exports averaged 800,000 barrels per day in 2022, Kpler's data showed, accounting for 17.3% of Russia's total seaborne exports.Exports of flagship Russian grade Urals averaged 1.74 million bpd, although Moscow has cut exports from its western ports by 10% in March from the previous month.Meanwhile, China's buying spree of ESPO continues as the country emerges from its zero-COVID regime, prompting a rebound in fuel demand from industry and the travel sector.China's seaborne imports of Russian oil are set to hit a record of nearly 43 million barrels this month, including at least 20 million barrels of ESPO.The solid demand drove the lumpsum freight rates for tankers carrying crude from Russia's Far East port Kozmino, a major ESPO export hub, to northern China to an all-time high of $2.4 million in February before easing to $2.3 million this month, Simpson Spence Young data on Refinitiv Eikon showed.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-jostles-with-china-for-april-espo-crude-from-russia-prices-jump/articleshow/98543407.cms,0,0.0

National Institute For Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST) should take it up as a challenge,” Kalaiselvi said while inaugurating the ‘One Week One Lab Programme’ of CSIR-NIIST at its campus at Pappanamcode. As Kerala is known for its heritage in rubber, NIIST can work with farmers and make rubber cultivation as an end-to-end support system, which will help create employment, rubber-based industries and farmers could be given more than enough benefits and advantages, she said. “We are having dependence on a lot of countries for rubber-based products whether it is tyre or value-added rubber products. When the country is talking about Atmanirbhar Bharat, self-reliance and Make in India initiatives, NIIST has to take up the new initiative by trying to promote more farmers into rubber cultivation and help them get a cherishable income,” she added. Noting that the next 25 years of India is scientifically important, Kalaiselvi urged researchers to adopt one industry problem by each one of them and address it and take a maximum of three years to come up with a solution. As part of OWOL, CSIR-NIIST, a constituent laboratory of CSIR, ministry of science and technology has lined-up a series of seminars featuring top scientists, technocrats and administrators.

Kolkata, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh were the only circles where it was yet to roll out the higher base prepaid rates, and now this exercise too has been concluded. “As per our checks, Bharti Airtel has now further rolled out this plan across the three remaining circles, Gujarat, Kolkata and Madhya Pradesh (total of 22 circles)… it has the first-mover in taking entry-level tariffs higher as competition has still not reacted,” global brokerage Morgan Stanley said.Untitled Carousel 98516461New plans across the countryPost the price hike, Airtel’s minimum monthly recharge plan in all 22 circles for prepaid users starts at Rs 155. It offers subscribers unlimited voice calling, 1GB data and 300 text messages. Earlier, the company had a minimum plan with a talk time value of Rs 99 and only 200MB of mobile data with 28-day validity in these states. All these earlier plans have been withdrawn nationally.Airtel had reported an ARPU of Rs 193 in the December quarter, FY23. Earlier this month, brokerage CLSA had said that Airtel’s move to extend the hike to 19 markets would boost its ARPU by 3% immediately to Rs 199.Untitled Carousel 98639320Brokerage Jefferies told ET that it expects Airtel’s ARPU to rise by 4-5% annually due to the improvement in subscriber mix, especially as the telco has another 107 million voice subscribers on its network who are yet to upgrade to data. Presently, Airtel’s mobile tariffs, across plans, are 25-57% higher than Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio’s. Chairman Sunil Mittal had at Mobile World Congress trade show held in Barcelona, Spain, late last month had signalled further hikes as market response to the last round of hikes had been encouraging, reflected in low subscriber churn.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/airtel-extends-base-prepaid-plans-rate-hike-to-all-circles-across-the-country/articleshow/98680933.cms,0,1.0

They are hired by businesses and states around the world, at great expense. Whether it’s McKinsey, Bain and Boston Consulting Group, or PwC, KPMG, EY, Deloitte and so on, these companies promise expertise and innovation in management strategy, accountancy, IT or climate solutions. What do consultants know, and what do they bring to the table? They offer some of the sought-after jobs, skimming the brightest grads from elite global universities. They promise new ideas, quantitative rigour and meticulousness, but this slicked-up business model evades risks and reaps rewards, say the authors. So what’s in it for the businesses and governments that hire consultancies? Sometimes, it is impression management, all about instilling confidence in clients through ‘brochuremanship’. Sometimes they are brought in to rubber-stamp a decision that has already been made by the management, like a difficult restructuring. Today omnipresent, the consulting business took wing in the late 1980s and 1990s, as the global neoliberal turn insisted that the market was the sole creator of value. As faith in the public sector plummeted, governments began enthusiastically contracting out their own functions. They welcomed public-private partnerships and private financing initiatives, so they could lower public debt in the books. Many years after that it turned out that the cost of servicing debts accrued through this method was twice as large as government borrowing in the UK. The consulting industry has soaked up every opportunity and weathered every downturn, from digitalising administrations to the financial recession, or Covid-response, or climate change interventions. In India, annual turnover of consulting firms increased by 10.8% annually on average in the five years to 2018. Budget allocations for professional services at the Niti Aayog increased nearly five-fold between 2016-17 and the following year, and subsequently rose by 30% in 2018-19. The book does not claim that consultants have no useful inputs, or that they are pulling a confidence trick. It is about examining the relationship between governments and consultancies. Organisations have tacit knowledge: the collective competence and skills of employees, and resources. The reliance on outside consultants erodes that institutional memory. For businesses, consultants may skew the focus towards value extraction rather than long-term investment in productive capabilities. For governments, the stakes are higher. The valued experiences of a long civil service career are lost, which undermine any public agency’s capacities. Politicians often work with consultancies too, which shapes their priorities in government. More than the enormous fees given to consultants by state agencies, the real problem is the lack of democratic accountability. They affect the lives and business or ordinary people, but this involvement is unknown and opaque to us. Consultancies are not to blame for the market-driven turn, the financialisation of the economy and hollowing out of the public sector. But it’s important to regulate the biz — that means strict rules on any conflicts of interest and disclosure of those contracting out duties. Governments must focus on their internal capacities, so that they can innovate from within. They must row so that they can steer — because the less they row, the less they learn, the less productive they become and the less they can steer.

Why should only state-run companies suffer when all Indian refiners are buying discounted Russian oil,"" the official said.A new notification is expected this week or early next week, the source added.India's trade ministry directed Reuters to seek comments from the oil ministry.

Now a new heavyweight has emerged in providing emergency loans to debt-ridden countries: China.New data shows that China is providing ever more emergency loans to countries, including Turkey, Argentina and Sri Lanka. China has been helping countries that have either geopolitical significance, such as a strategic location, or lots of natural resources. Many of them have been borrowing heavily from Beijing for years to pay for infrastructure or other projects.While China is not yet equal to the IMF, it is catching up fast, providing $240bn of emergency financing in recent years. China gave $40.5bn in such loans to distressed countries in 2021, according to a new study by American and European experts who drew on statistics from AidData, a research institute at William and Mary, a university in Williamsburg, Virginia. China provided $10bn in 2014 and none in 2010. medium99051563By comparison, the IMF lent $68.6bn to countries in financial distress in 2021 — a pace that has stayed fairly steady in recent years except for a jump in 2020, at the start of the pandemic.In many ways, China has replaced the United States in bailing out indebted low-and middle-income countries. The U.S. Treasury’s last sizeable rescue loan to a middle-income country was a $1.5bn credit to Uruguay in 2002. The Federal Reserve still provides short-term financing to other industrialised countries when they need extra dollars for a few days or weeks.China’s emerging position as a lender of last resort reflects its evolving status as an economic superpower at a time of global weakness. Dozens of countries are struggling to pay their debts, as a slowing economy and rising interest rates push many nations to the brink.The IMF has also stepped up its own bailouts in recent weeks, in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine and the aftereffects of the pandemic. The IMF reached a preliminary agreement on March 21 to lend $15.6bn to Ukraine, a day after its board approved a $3bn loan to Sri Lanka.Beijing’s new role is also an outgrowth of the decade-old Belt and Road Initiative, the signature project of Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, to develop geopolitical and diplomatic ties through financial and commercial efforts. China has lent $900bn to 151 lower-income countries worldwide, mainly for the construction of highways, bridges, hydroelectric dams and other infrastructure. medium99051710US officials have accused China of engaging in ""debt trap diplomacy” that is saddling countries with excessive debt for construction projects carried out by Chinese companies often using Chinese engineers, Chinese workers and Chinese equipment. Chinese officials contend that they have built much-needed infrastructure that the West talked about for decades but never completed.Unlike many lenders to developing countries, state-controlled financial institutions in China largely doled out loans at adjustable rates. The payments due on many of these loans have doubled in the past year, putting many nations in a difficult financial spot. China, for its part, blames the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, for putting pressure on countries by pushing up interest rates.China’s central bank is extending the separate, emergency loans at fairly high interest rates to Laos, Pakistan, Nigeria, Suriname and other financially distressed countries. China’s state-owned banks face losses if Beijing does not bail out their borrowers but may profit if other countries manage to stay current on their debt payments.China charges somewhat high interest rates for emergency credit to middle-income countries in distress, typically 5%. That compares with 2% for loans from the IMF, the new study found.The US Treasury charged almost the same interest rate as China — 4.8% — when it made rescue loans to middle-income countries in the 1990s through 2002. The Fed has recently been charging about 1% for its short-term loans to other industrialised countries.China’s emergency lending has gone almost entirely to middle-income countries that owe a lot of money to state-controlled Chinese banks. More than 90% of China’s emergency loans in 2021 were in its own currency, the renminbi.It is not unusual for a country to use its own currency in international rescues. The dollar displaced European currencies in the borrowing of many developing countries after the United States played a central role in resolving the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s.In lending renminbi, Beijing is furthering its efforts to limit reliance on the US dollar as the go-to global currency. When borrowing renminbi from China’s central bank using so-called swap agreements, the indebted countries then keep the renminbi in their central reserves while spending their dollars to repay foreign debts.Some countries, such as Mongolia, now hold much of their currency reserves in renminbi, after previously holding them mainly in dollars, said Brad Parks, executive director of AidData and an author of the study.Such financial moves tether countries more closely to China, since the renminbi is hard to spend except to buy Chinese goods and services. In their meeting last week, Xi and President Vladimir Putin of Russia agreed that more of their countries’ trade and other commercial ties will be connected to the renminbi.Foreign minister Qin Gang of China has strongly defended his country’s debt record, noting that China allowed dozens of the world’s poorest countries to delay debt repayments in 2020 and 2021.“China has suspended more debt service payments than any other Group of 20 member,” he said in a March 2 speech at a gathering of foreign ministers of the large G20 countries.As China increasingly steps into the role of emergency lender and its own economy slows, it is also reassessing its broader lending program. More recently, it has begun pulling back from infrastructure loans. According to data from China’s ministry of commerce, the annual value of completed contracts in Belt and Road Initiative countries fell to $85bn last year, from a peak of $98bn in 2019.“We are seeing the emergence of another big financial rescue player in the international financial system,” as the cost of Belt and Road Initiative loans becomes clear, said Christoph Trebesch, research director for international finance and macroeconomics at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany and an author of the study.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/after-doling-out-huge-loans-china-is-now-bailing-out-countries/articleshow/99051462.cms,1,1.0

Russia backed the voluntary cuts by extending planned reduction in output.The International Energy Agency last month said global oil demand could rise to over 103 million barrels a day, up 2.2 million barrels from current levels. Clearly then, the latest production cuts will keep prices elevated, with most analysts suggesting $80-90 per barrel and some brokerages even rooting for $100.OPEC lynchpin Saudi Arabia described the move as a measure to ensure oil market stability. Market watchers saw a bigger play in geopolitics and the recent strain in relations between Washington and Riyadh over president Joe Biden pushing for higher volumes from OPEC to reduce prices further and his administration’s public iteration that the US was in no hurry to fill the strategic petroleum reserve.As a country that meets 85% of oil need through imports, India is vulnerable to any volatility in oil prices. So for fuel consumers in India, the cuts could not have come at a worse time. The recent drop in oil prices had turned petrol and diesel profitable for retailers, who were earlier suffering losses because of the freeze on pump prices amid elevated crude.In a sign of improved margins, private sector retailer such as Reliance Industries Ltd recently pared its prices to match state-run companies. This set off a buzz that a reduction in fuel prices was round the corner since private retailers charged more than state retailers to minimise the under recovery. But with oil near $85 per barrel, a price cut looks improbable.For the Centre, flaring oil will fuel inflationary pressure on the economy. Prashant Vasisht of ICRA said higher oil prices increase the import bill and weakens the rupee against the dollar, impacting current account deficit. They also raise LPG subsidy bill and manufacturing cost. On the upside, oil producers will benefit from higher profits and cash accruals, which will lead to higher windfall gains tax yield for the Centre.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/opec-move-dashes-hopes-of-fuel-price-cut-revives-inflation-fears/articleshow/99221958.cms,0,0.0

The Reliance Brands management has alleged that the former executive, a resident of Gurgaon, stole data from the office’s computer and sent it to his personal email ID in April last year. The data contained annual operating plans of a partner firm from 2022 to 2027, said the complainant, Reliance Brands financial manager Sanjeev Vashista.Neither Agarwalla nor Vashista could be reached for comment on Wednesday evening. According to the complaint, the executive joined the company on July 13, 2021 and was managing three prominent brands that have a partnership with Reliance Brands.“During the course of his employment with the company, the accused was involved in sending internal strategic documents of the Mothercare brand to his personal email address. Taking undue advantage of his position, the accused engineered a way to misuse the trust and resources bestowed upon him as the CFO of the business of the company,” the complaint read.The complaint stated Reliance Brands was alerted about the email on April 28, 2022, a few days after the Agarwalla allegedly forwarded the document.  “Our internal risk management team on April 28, 2022, highlighted that on April 25, 2022, the accused had exported an excel file containing an annual operating plan for the business. It contained activities that the company was planning to undertake and financial details of the business for the current financial 2022-2023 and the upcoming financial years till 2026-2027,” the FIR reads.The company told TOI it took a year to conduct an internal inquiry. “Owing to our robust systems, we were able to promptly detect the fraudulent activity and effectively mitigate its potential impact. This individual was still an employee when this incident took place, following which we terminated his services,” a company spokesperson said at n Wednesday. The firm said it has submitted Agarwalla’s statement to police for further investigation.“The accused will be contacted soon.

Lula wants Brazil, China and other nations to help mediate the war as part of his nation's return to the world stage, but his proposals to end the conflict have irked Ukraine and some in the West. Less controversial is the Brazilian and Chinese mutual interest in trade after a rocky period under Lula's predecessor.  China and Brazil are expected to sign at least 20 bilateral agreements during Lula's two-day stay, according to the Brazilian government. Lula plans to visit Shanghai and Beijing, and meet with his counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday. The two leaders are expected to discuss trade, investment, reindustrialization, energy transition, climate change and peace agreements, the Brazilian government said. China is Brazil's biggest export market, each year buying tens of billions of dollars worth of soybeans, beef, iron ore, poultry, pulp, sugar cane, cotton and crude oil. Brazil is the biggest recipient of Chinese investment in Latin America, according to Chinese state media. Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and members of his family at times caused friction with Chinese authorities during his 2019-2022 term. In 2020, when Bolsonaro's lawmaker son Eduardo blamed the COVID-19 pandemic on the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese ambassador to Brazil called his words ""an evil insult against China and the Chinese people."" Later that year, Eduardo referred to the giant Chinese technology company Huawei as ""Chinese espionage,"" prompting a sharp rebuke from China's embassy. Last year, China did not have an ambassador in Brasilia for eight months. The rift stoked criticism in Brazil, even among sectors that supported Bolsonaro, like agribusiness.  ""I want the Chinese to understand that their investment here will be wonderfully welcome, but not to buy our companies. To build new things, which we need,"" Lula told journalists in Brasilia on April 6. Chinese companies are involved in public works projects in Brazil, including a metro line in Sao Paulo, the country's business capital. One of the agreements Lula will sign in China will be for construction of the sixth satellite built under a binational program, a satellite that would monitor biomes such as the Amazon rainforest. ""Brazil can't afford to turn its back on the benefits China brings. The US doesn't have the capacity to absorb Brazil's exports as China does, nor occupy the same space in investment and infrastructure,"" said Pedro Brites, an expert on China at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university and think tank in Sao Paulo. And China is encouraging its companies to find new markets and foreign partners to reduce reliance on the US ""Lula knows you have to treat your clients well. Even more so when it is your best client,"" said Charles Tang, who chairs the Brazil-China Chamber of Commerce. In what Tang suggested was the result of a renewed partnership, China ended restrictions on Brazilian beef just before Lula was initially scheduled to make his trip. Sales of Brazilian beef to China were banned in February following the discovery of an atypical case of mad cow disease. Lula's visit to China, initially scheduled for March but canceled after he fell sick, is also an attempt by the leftist leader to reaffirm Brazil's role on the global stage following Bolsonaro's term, who admired right-wing nationalists and showed little interest in international affairs or travel abroad. Lula visited Argentina and Uruguay in January and the US in February, signaling the importance he gives to international affairs, experts said. He toured the world during his first presidency, particularly in his second term, when he visited dozens of countries, and has visited China twice before. ""Lula is implementing the promise he made that Brazil is back,"" said Oliver Stuenkel, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation.  China and Brazil are members of the BRICS group of developing countries and have pushed for changes in what they say is a US-dominated system of managing global political affairs.  Russia is also a BRICS member, and a key piece of Lula's outreach abroad is his proposal that Brazil and other developing countries, including China, mediate peace. Lula has irritated Ukraine and some in the West with his position on the war, most recently by suggesting during a meeting with journalists in Brasilia last week that Ukraine cede Crimea as a means to forge peace. Xi met with Putin last month, sending a message to US and European leaders that their condemnation of Russia's invasion is not unanimous. Earlier this month, a Lula adviser, former foreign affairs minister Celso Amorim, took a discreet trip to Moscow, where he met with President Vladimir Putin. Amorim ""went to listen and to say the time has come to talk,"" Brazilian foreign minister Mauro Vieira told reporters in the capital, Brasilia, on April 5. There is at least some common ground. Vieira noted that the Chinese peace proposal presented in February contains aspects in common with Lula's, such as ceasing hostilities and starting negotiations. ""These are completely plausible and may be stimulus for talks,"" he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/brazils-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-visits-china-seeking-ties-and-ukraine-support/articleshow/99425052.cms,0,1.0

Television series are set to premiere on JioCinema on the same day as the U.S.,"" the companies said.Clement Schwebig, President for India, Southeast Asia and Korea for Warner Bros, said the agreement was part of its commitment to the South Asia market, as the company looks to further strengthen the scale of its regional business.One source told Reuters that the partnership would be exclusive and see most of Warner's marquee content on the JioCinema platform. Warner cannot offer most of its popular titles to other Indian rivals including Amazon Prime Video and Disney Hotstar, the source added.""It's a deep exclusive arrangement which will make JioCinema the house of Warner, HBO in India,"" the source said.The content deal will bring thousands of hours of streaming content onto JioCinema, which has become popular for showing the IPL cricket tournament on the platform for free in the ongoing season.Viacom18 won the IPL digital streaming rights from 2023 to 2027 for around $2.9 billion, rights which Disney previously held. Viacom18's shareholders include Reliance, Paramount Global as well as Bodhi Tree, which is a joint venture between James Murdoch and a former Star India executive, Uday Shankar.Bodhi Tree recently invested $528 million in Viacom18.Several of HBO's top rated shows, including Succession, had aired in India on the Disney Hotstar platform until March 31 as part of a deal between the two companies that ended on the date.The source told Reuters that Warner so far had various arrangements with Indian streaming giants, but the Viacom-Warner deal will see consolidation of that library and will include HBO, Max and Warner content, among others.JioCinema is seeking to compete with rivals including Netflix and Amazon in a market where such platforms are becoming increasingly popular, thanks to cheap data prices.""These marquee deals from IPL to HBO are great for not only user acquisition but also for stickiness and mind share,"" said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research.For now, JioCinema is a small player. Netflix outperforms rivals in the subscription video-on-demand market, commanding a 39% share by revenue in 2021 compared to nearest rival Hotstar's 23%, according to Media Partners Asia.

The proportion of contract workers in tech roles within the non-tech sector is expected to rise from the current 20% to around 26% by the end of FY 2027, indicating an increasing reliance on temporary or contract-based tech professionals. The report predicts that the retail and consumer segment will be the biggest in terms of total tech employees by FY27 followed by BFSI & consulting, engineering research & development and communication & media technology.“There has been a steep hike in tech recruitment within non-tech industries in recent years, amounting to over one lakh active openings during the last couple of months and the incremental growth in salary in non-tech industries is higher than in technology-centric companies,” said Sunil Chemmankotil, CEO, TeamLease Digital. “This has played a major role in the movement of tech personnel from niche tech industries into non-tech industries.” There is also the recent trend of layoffs in the big tech companies to reconcile the over-hiring during the pandemic years. “The government’s budget allocations in FY23 make provision for skill development in new skill development in new-age skills such as AI and ML along with the establishment of skill development centers across smaller towns and cities and organizations are increasingly accepting the importance of learning and development as an integral part of the business and investing in the reskilling and upskilling of their employees,” said Munira Loliwala, AVP & BU head, TeamLease Digital. All of these trends will benefit the tech talent flow into non-tech industries.Since there is a shortage of technical talent due to the sudden surge in demand, many non-tech sectors have seen a sharp spike in the number of contract positions. Due to increased innovation, use of AI and automation, and process optimization, there has been a rise in demand for IT expertise across non-tech industries. Additionally, the adoption of the 5G network has also created a demand for talent in industries like the automotive, semiconductor, startup, and telecom sectors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/non-tech-sector-talent-pool-to-grow-at-7-5/articleshow/99920918.cms,0,0.0

The HC also directed the state to refund the amount with a 6% interest per annum within a period of two months. High court Judge, Justice Rakesh Mohan Pandey, disposed of the petition filed by Abhishek Pandey, the counsel for petitioner headmaster, Surya Prakash Mishra, a resident of Masturi, Bilaspur.The writ petition filed in the Court states that the BEO had issued an order on June 25, 2018, for the recovery of the aforesaid amount from the petitioner, who was posted as headmaster of the government primary school, Seepat, Bilaspur.The petitioner retired from services on July 31, 2018, on attaining the age of superannuation. At the time of preparation of retiral dues documents, an assessment was made by the BEO, who found that the salary of the petitioner was erroneously fixed on a higher pay scale from January 1, 1999 to March 31, 2018.The counsel submitted to the court that the BEO issued an order of recovery to the petitioner during the service period before one month of retirement, and the same has already been deducted from his gratuity. The counsel placed reliance upon the judgments of the Supreme Court in the State of Punjab vs Rafiq Masih and others and Thomas Daniel vs the State of Kerala and others to buttress his submission.On the other hand, counsel for the state government, Ravi Bhagat, submitted that prior to the date of retirement, an undertaking was given by the petitioner to the effect that if any excess payment was paid to him, the same shall be adjusted from his salary. He placed reliance on the matter of the high court of Punjab and Haryana and others vs Jagdev Singh and submitted that the order of recovery is valid, and the excess amount given to the petitioner can be recovered.The court said that there is no provision in the Chhattisgarh Pay Revision Rules to take an undertaking from any government servant. Therefore, the judgment passed in the case of Jagdev Singh, placed by the state counsel, is distinguishable from the facts of the present case.The court observed that the order of recovery of excess payment has been raised after 19 years before one month of the petitioner’s retirement. There was no misrepresentation on the part of the petitioner, who was not even granted an opportunity for a hearing. The respondents did not conduct an inquiry before passing the order. With these observations, the high court quashed the BEO's order and asked to refund the amount recovered from the petitioner within a period of two months from the date of receipt of the copy of this order, and the amount shall carry a 6% interest per annum from the date of recovery till its refund.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/hc-quashes-state-govt-order-for-recovery-from-headmaster/articleshow/100000121.cms,2,2.0

The company, however, said the discount is an introductory offer.State-run retaialers have been selling additive-laced diesel for yeart higher cost and under different brand to differentiate from regular diesel. IndianOil’s ‘XtraMile’ diesel costs Rs 92.91per litre in Delhi and Rs 97.51 in Mumbai against Rs 89.62 and Rs 92.28, respectively for regular diesel. At Rs 88.62, Jio-bp’s super diesel is Rs 3.29 cheaper from comparable products from rivals in Delhi and Rs 5.23 in Mumbai. Compared to regular diesel, Jio-bp’s offering costs about Re 1 less.""While every single customer is important, truckers have always held a special place for Jio-bp. Accounting for over half of the truckers' operating costs, we understand the critical impact of fuel on their overall business performance,” Jio-bp CEO Harish C Mehta said.The “high-performance” fuel is “set to elevate diesel standards for Indian consumers,” the company said, adding the additives will “restore and maintain” engine power by removing deposits on engine surface. This improves performance and reduces the risk of unscheduled maintenance.Jio-bp’s move comes amid improved retail margins on the back of lower oil prices and is bound to prompt public demand for reduction in petrol and diesel prices sold by state-run retailers. Pump prices have remained unchanged since last May, while oil prices have come off their high a year ago as the state retailers recover losses suffered during oil’s high run.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/jio-bp-kicks-off-price-war-with-super-diesel/articleshow/100284404.cms,0,0.5

With consumers becoming more discerning, demanding, open to experimentation, there’s enough and more headroom to grow.""The share of beauty in the $ 17 billion local beauty and personal care (BPC) market is under 20%"", said Rishav Jain, managing director at Alvarez & Marsal India.Mumbai-based Tanni Mandal feels India needs more offline beauty stores, New Delhi’s Tanya Aggarwal still can’t find adequate choice of concealers in the market while Dharamshala’s Vaishali Dhiman wishes to see more brands that can cater to different skin tones. This probably explains why big conglomerates like Reliance Industries and the Tata Group have their eyes set on the beauty space. “By 2030, the size of the BPC market is expected to double. From a size and growth perspective, it’s a good category to be in for companies which want scale,” said Anand Ramanathan, partner at Deloitte India.In strict industry terms, beauty includes colour cosmetics, make-up products, fragrances and parts of men’s grooming items. Skincare and body care products are usually categorised as personal care although such rigid segmentation is hardly adhered to in regular practice. Angshuman Bhattacharya, partner and national leader, consumer product and retail sector at EY India said that several segments even in face care and body care have less than 35% of household penetration.While announcing the launch of its tech backed omni-channel beauty platform Tira earlier this month, Reliance Retail Ventures’ executive director Isha Ambani made the company’s ambitions in the space clear: “We aim to break down barriers in the beauty space and democratise beauty for consumers across segments.” The Tata Group which runs a standalone online beauty platform Tata CLiQ Palette wants to go equally aggressive on the market. “The beauty industry is expected to grow at a double digit CAGR for the next 5-10 years and our aim is to revolutionise the space by becoming India’s largest tech-enabled beauty destination,” said a spokesperson at Tata CLiQ Palette. Both the firms offer a mix of home-grown and global brands.And their ambitions have legs. With the increasing participation of women in the workforce, the added touch of glamour to the corporate culture with the entry of startups, the basket of occasion for beauty consumption has broadened, triggering demand for a wider product range. Besides, Gen Z and millennials who make up a significant portion of the earning population have taken to consumption of products that promise clean beauty, use natural ingredients and eco-friendly packaging. Green beauty is in vogue; as Mumbaikar Divya Jethi said: “people are becoming aware of the harmful chemicals like parabens and sulfates.” In other words, companies will have to step up innovation. “Consumers want variety. For that companies will have to build a wide portfolio and add depth to the range for the business models to become viable. The young people are seeking cruelty free beauty products with no animal testing. All of these require capital and can only be catered to by big players,” said Ramanathan. Micro-trends such as naturals, functional ingredients, sustainability and organic are driving premiumisation and specialisation, making BPC one of the most attractive FMCG segments, said Bhattacharya.The entry of big players will also lead to organised retailing. The beauty market in the small towns is very unorganised with customers still dependent on unbranded stores for purchases. E-commerce has sure helped but beauty as a category often requires the element of touch and feel. “There are only about 80,000-100,000 beauty stores across India. As new players enter the market, availability of products will get better not just in metros, but in the small towns, leading to higher adoption,” said Jain who estimates that the adoption of beauty is going to increase by 14%-15% CAGR over the next few years. With the supply of contract manufacturers getting augmented, developing private labels will not be difficult for companies either, said Neelesh Hundekari, head of fashion and luxury, APAC at Kearney.

The heat poses health risks, including diarrhoea, fungal infections and heatstroke. Problems related to eyes and headache are also caused due to soaring mercury and scorching sunlight.As outdoor activities remain limited, children’s reliance on mobile phones and television for entertainment has also become a cause of concern.Dr Saurabh Kumar, a neuropsychiatrist, has cautioned against rising temperature that can also disrupt serotonin regulation, leading to irritability and aggressive behaviour in children. “To counter this, parents are advised to engage their kids in hobbies like swimming or music lessons for keeping their mind and bodies active,” he said.Health experts suggest changes in food and lifestyle in hot weather. “In the summer season when the temperature rises and the sun is more intense, cases of dehydration, heatstroke, lethargy, tiredness and stomach problems are common. To avoid all these problems, it is important to take special care of our diet,” said Dr Nitesh Kumar, an Ayurveda, naturopathy and yoga expert.He suggested certain yoga asanas or techniques for students to tackle the heat. “Chakrasana is beneficial for health and eyes and it also makes the brain healthy. Sheetali Pranayama cools the body temperature. In case of headache in summer, Paschimottanasan can help,” said Dr Nitesh.Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, a city-based physician, emphasized that parents should promptly seek medical help if their children experience symptoms like cramps, fever or loss of appetite. “Adequate hydration is crucial and loose cotton clothing is recommended. Outdoor activities should be avoided between 11am and 4pm,” he said.Maintaining a healthy diet is also vital during this time of the year. Shaziya Shahin, a dietician, advises fruits with high water content, such as watermelon and litchi, along with refreshing salads of tomatoes and cucumbers. “Electrolyte-rich beverages should also be consumed. Packaged fruit juices and junk food should be avoided while protein-rich breakfast is essential,” she said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/weather-spoils-pupils-summer-vacation-plans/articleshow/100665021.cms,2,1.0

Most of the digital transactions that are taking place are based on OTPs and it becomes a problem when users willingly share them with others, creating a security breach which is exploited by the fraudsters. Godse said that replacing OTPs and going completely without passwords will need another three to four years. While the country is increasing its reliance on digital economy, creating awareness is also important, Godse said, adding that the corporate, banks and the RBI are taking efforts to raise awareness but it is not enough as reaching out to people on such a large scale. The increasing number of cyber fraud cases is a worrisome and providing support mechanism to the victims is important.DSCI is a not-for-profit body working on data protection and is setup by NASSCOM. Apart from providing training to law enforcement and judiciary through its centre in Bengaluru, DSCI also collaborates with national agencies including Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C to deal with cybercrime.

The talks are in a ""very, very nascent"" stage and no potential buyer or partner has been approached so far, and it remains unclear how the process will pan out, the person added. ""Talks have begun internally (on) what makes sense to do,"" said the source, adding discussions were being driven by executives at Disney  headquarters in the U.S. Disney did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The company's shares closed up 1.6% on Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal was first to report news of Disney's talks and said the company had reached out to at least one bank about ways to help the India business grow, while sharing some of the costs. The discussions come at a time when Disney has faced increasing pressure due to the emergence of Reliance Industries' streaming platform JioCinema, run by Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani. He has been marketing his streaming platform by offering free access to Indian Premier League cricket tournament, digital rights of which were earlier with Disney. Research firm CLSA has estimated Disney+ Hotstar's subscriber base shrank by nearly 5 million users in India after it lost the digital rights for IPL. Reliance's broadcast venture Viacom18, which runs JioCinema, also struck a deal with Warner Bros in April for HBO and other popular content such as Succession. Several of these top rated shows earlier aired in India on the Disney platform. Viacom18's shareholders include Reliance, Paramount Global as well as Bodhi Tree, which is a joint venture between James Murdoch and a former Star India executive, Uday Shankar. Disney's India business comprises the Disney+ Hotstar streaming service and Star India, which it took over when it acquired the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox in 2019. The source, who declined to be named as the talks are confidential, said it will be difficult to find an outright buyer in India as the enterprise value of the India business was seen around $15-16 billion when Disney took over Fox's business. Star India, which was rebranded as Disney Star last year, encompasses dozens of TV channels and a stake in a movie production company. Disney, like its peers in streaming and the wider media industry, is cutting costs as macro economic headwinds weigh on its advertising revenue and subscriber growth.  In February, the company said it would cut 7,000 jobs as part of an effort to save $5.5 billion in costs in a sweeping restructuring of the company.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/web-series/news/english/walt-disney-in-talks-for-sale-or-partnership-for-india-digital-and-tv-business/articleshow/101925099.cms,1,1.0

While higher subscriber addition, stable ARPU (average revenue per user) and more users converting to 5G boosted telecom segment earnings, the retail segment performed better than peers despite no demand trigger such as the festive season.Finance cost jumped 46 per cent to Rs 5,837 crore due to higher interest rates and loan balance. Depreciation/amortisation expenses were up 31.7 per cent to Rs 11,775 crore due to expanded asset base across all businesses and higher network utilisation in the digital services business.Operationally, the company posted a 5 per cent growth in EBITDA or earnings before tax, at Rs 41,982 crore.Revenue from operations fell to Rs 2.1 lakh crore from Rs 2.22 lakh crore in the year-ago period and Rs 2.16 lakh crore in January-March 2023. This was primarily because crude oil prices fell 31 per cent.The mainstay oil refining and petrochemicals business, called O2C, posted a 23.2 per cent fall in EBITDA to Rs 15,271 crore.Rising demand, low inventories and oil market disruption centred around Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushed cracks -- the differential between a barrel of crude oil (raw material) and the petroleum products refined from it -- to record last year.Diesel cracks in June last year soared to $74.95 a barrel while petrol cracks neared $42. Jet fuel cracks soared to $62. Diesel cracks in June this year hovered between $16 and $19 while petrol cracks were in the range of $10 to $14.""Demand was impacted by destocking on recessionary fears and high-interest rates, as well as slower than expected ramp-up in China markets,"" the statement said adding exports fell 28 per cent.With the consumer base swelling to 448.5 million from 439.3 million at the end of March and ARPU rising to Rs 180.5 from Rs 178.8, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd - the digital services business - posted a 12.5 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 5,098 crore in Q1. Also aiding the business was consumers migrating to its latest offering 5G services and IPL streaming bringing in bumper advertisement revenue.Profits from retail business climbed 19 per cent to Rs 2,448 crore as store count rose to 18,446 from 18,040.Oil and gas EBITDA soared 27 per cent to Rs 4,015 crore as gas production from KG-D6 block rose on hooking to the production of the deepest field.""Block KG D6 is currently producing around 27 million standard cubic meters per day (up from 19 mmscmd in the previous quarter) and is expected to reach 30 mmscmd in coming months,"" it said.The company said its net debt stood at Rs 1.26 lakh crore.Commenting on the results, Mukesh D.

It al","Reliance Industries (RIL) is taking major steps to establish green hydrogen production infrastructure in Gujarat, preparing for its ambitious plans to begin fuel production by 2025, an ET report states. According to sources quoted in the report, the company has secured 74,750 hectares of land in Gujarat on a 40-year lease for its green hydrogen project. RIL is actively partnering with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to secure a green hydrogen supply chain and is also laying the groundwork to distribute green hydrogen through its Jio-BP outlets, they said.Green hydrogen, produced through renewable energy sources, is the cleanest form of fuel. RIL aims to achieve a significant milestone of producing green hydrogen at just $1 per kilogram by 2030. Presently, the production economics of green hydrogen are estimated to be around $8-9 per kilogram, compared to less than $4 per kilogram for traditional fuels and feedstocks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4jn6rn02vwAn industry official, speaking anonymously to ET, confirmed that RIL is diligently constructing green hydrogen dispensation infrastructure to ensure a smooth offtake of green hydrogen once production commences. ""The company is targeting production of green hydrogen by 2025, and when that happens, it needs a ready infrastructure for offtake,"" the official said. The company did not respond to an email inquiry sent by ET.RIL has planned an investment of $10 billion in capex to build a new energy ecosystem. Over the past several months, RIL has formed strategic partnerships with OEMs to supply green hydrogen.Earlier this year, RIL collaborated with Ashok Leyland to unveil India's first hydrogen internal combustion engine (H2ICE) technology solution for heavy-duty trucks. Additionally, RIL, along with Olectra Greentech, a subsidiary of Megha Engineering and Infrastructures (MEIL), introduced a hydrogen bus in February, targeting commercial launch within a year. In another step, RIL joined forces with Bharat Benz to develop India's first intercity luxury concept coach powered by hydrogen fuel cell technology.The H2ICE technology stands out as a combustion engine that can use hydrogen or a mixture of hydrogen and diesel fuel without requiring significant modifications to the vehicle's powertrain. This adaptability allows for easier conversion of vehicles to hydrogen-powered ones with minor adjustments.RIL's partners state that these hydrogen-powered vehicles have an impressive travel range of approximately 400 km on a single fill, enabling long-distance travel between cities using clean fuel. Furthermore, refueling with hydrogen takes just 15 minutes for this range coverage. These vehicles will undergo rigorous trials, validation, and safety assessments over the next year.Through its partnership with Ashok Leyland, RIL plans to retrofit engines for the company's fleet of trucks. RIL contracts a fleet of around 45,000 vehicles that are used for its refining and marketing operations. RIL's vision is to transition these trucks to green hydrogen, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable logistics ecosystem.Barnik Chitran Maitra, managing partner, India & South Asia, of consulting firm Arthur D Little was quoted in the report sayinf that the domestic use cases for green hydrogen may start with small pilots. According to Maitra, the focus will shift towards partnerships with global shipping firms, international transmission system operators, and international power generators, that are expected to replace fossil fuels with green hydrogen in the next five years.RIL also has plans to retail green hydrogen through its Jio-BP retail outlets. With around 1,500 outlets already in operation, RIL aims to expand the network to 5,000, making green hydrogen easily accessible to the public, the report said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-industries-eyes-green-hydrogen-production-in-2-years-aims-to-bring-down-production-cost-to-just-1-per-kg-by-2030/articleshow/102388117.cms,0,0.0

Per-user data consumption on Jio’s network has also surged, with the average user now consuming over 25 GB every month. This translates to monthly data traffic of 1100 crore GBs, representing a 45% year-on-year growth,” Ambani said at the 46th AGM of Reliance Industries. Indicating an aggressive expansion plan in 5G, Ambani said that the company has been adding one 5G cell to our network every 10 seconds. “… we will have nearly one million 5G cells operational in our network by December.”He said the company began 5G rollout last October. “In just nine months, Jio 5G is already present in over 96% of the census towns of our country. And we're on track to cover the entire country by December of this year. This makes Jio 5G the fastest-ever 5G rollout of this scale anywhere in the world.”On Jio AirFiber, the fixed-wireless broadband offering from the company, he said that the effort is to provide broadband to areas that have remained unconnected due to the complexities and delays involved in extending optical fiber to their premises. “Jio AirFiber uses our pan-India 5G network and advanced wireless technologies to bypass the need for last-mile fibre. Through optical fiber, we can currently connect around 15,000 premises daily. But with Jio AirFiber, we can supercharge this expansion with up to 150,000 connections per day. That is a ten-fold increase, expanding our addressable market over the next three years to over 200 million high-paying homes and premises.”Ambani also outlined aggressive plans for Artificial Intelligence (AI), terming it the ""most exciting frontier of growth"" for Jio. Ambani said the company will create up to 2,000 MW of AI-ready computing capacity, across both cloud and edge locations, while adopting sustainable practices and greener future.A global AI revolution is reshaping the world and intelligent applications will redefine and revolutionise industries, economies, and even daily life, sooner than expected, he said, adding that to stay globally competitive, India must harness AI for innovation, growth, and national prosperity.

""The companies will work together to build AI infrastructure that is over an order of magnitude more powerful than the fastest supercomputer in India today,"" the firms said in a statement.  Days before the announcement, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday.  Starting operations in India in 2004, NVIDIA has four engineering development centres in the country - in Gurugram, Hyderabad, Pune and Bengaluru -with over 3,800 employees.  Its collaboration with Reliance will ""develop India's own foundation large language model trained on the nation's diverse languages and tailored for generative AI applications to serve the world's most populous nation,"" the statement said.  NVIDIA will provide access to the most advanced GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip and DGX Cloud, an AI supercomputing service in the cloud. GH200 marks a fundamental shift in computing architecture that provides exceptional performance and massive memory bandwidth.  ""The NVIDIA-powered AI infrastructure is the foundation of the new frontier into AI for Reliance Jio Infocomm, Reliance Industries' telecom arm. The global AI revolution is transforming industries and daily life.  ""To serve India's vast potential in AI, Reliance will create AI applications and services for their 450 million Jio customers and provide energy-efficient AI infrastructure to scientists, developers and startups across India,"" the statement said.  AI can help rural farmers interact via cell phones in their local language to get weather information and crop prices. It can help provide, at massive scale, expert diagnosis of medical symptoms and imaging scans where doctors may not be immediately available.  AI can better predict cyclonic storms using decades of atmospheric data, enabling those at risk to evacuate and find shelter.  ""The AI infrastructure will be hosted in AI-ready computing data centers that will eventually expand to 2,000 MW. Execution and implementation will be managed by Jio, which has extensive offerings and experience across mobile telephony, 5G spectrum, fiber networks and more,"" it said.  Huang said NVIDIA is ""delighted to partner with Reliance to build state-of-the-art AI supercomputers in India.""  ""India has scale, data and talent. With the most advanced AI computing infrastructure, Reliance can build its own large language models that power generative AI applications made in India, for the people of India,"" he said.  Jio has broad expertise, infrastructure and engineering skill to roll out and manage the new AI computing infrastructure. The collaboration with NVIDIA also aligns with its strategy of serving as a large, comprehensive digital, cloud and networking platform for both consumers and business customers.

The executives did not clarify when the company planned to start selling these batteries.Development of battery storage solutions is a part of Reliance's bigger $10 billion green push towards clean energy projects. The company aims to cut dependence on its mainstay oil-to-chemical business and be net zero carbon by 2035.The company acquired two battery companies for about $200 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively -- UK-based Faradion that makes sodium-ion batteries, and Lithium Werks, that produces lithium iron phosphate (LFP)batteries. Reliance displayed LFP chemistry based battery at the exhibition.A company presentation at the event showed it is also working on customizable batteries for business and individual usage, intelligent swap stations and integrated charging networks. Reliance doesn't plan to get in to EV manufacturing but will partner with EV makers, the presentation showed.Reliance won an incentive last year to set up a 5 gigawatt hours (GWh) battery manufacturing facility under India's $2.4 billion programme that aims to boost local battery cell production.The factory will be set up by 2026 and will make batteries and containerised energy storage solutions.Clean auto technology is central to India's strategy of cutting pollution in major cities and reaching its broader climate goals. Electric vehicles currently make up a fraction of total sales in India mainly due to their high price as the batteries are imported, and a lack of charging infrastructure.The government is trying to encourage swappable batteries to bring down costs and promote wider adoption of EVs.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/news/reliance-unveils-swappable-multipurpose-batteries-for-evs/articleshow/104156546.cms,2,1.5

Sun TV Network Group Chief financial Officer S L Narayanan said the group doesn’t comment on market rumours or speculation. A spokesperson for Adani also said they wouldn’t comment on market speculation.The discussions around the sale of Disney’s India unit show how the market dynamics have been disrupted ever since Ambani’s conglomerate scooped up the streaming rights to the Indian Premier League for $2.7 billion and chose to broadcast it for free earlier this year. Ambani scored another win by bagging a multi-year pact to broadcast Warner Bros Discovery Inc’s HBO and other content that was previously with Disney.Disney is now using Reliance’s playbook and streaming the ongoing Cricket World Cup in India for free — a move aimed at clawing back some subscribers even if it means sacrificing revenue in the cricket-crazy nation of 1.4 billion people.Disney, however, is likely getting a boost as marquee global brands line up to tap India’s massive consumer base, with advertising slots being sold at $3,600 a second.

According to an ET analysis, approximately half of the Nifty50 stocks, including prominent names like Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Tata Consumer, and Hindustan Unilever, have exhibited underperformance in comparison to the Nifty benchmark over the last two years.Analysts assert that when the market rebounds from its current weakness, large-cap stocks are likely to outshine their smaller counterparts. This is attributed to the perceived overstretching of valuations in mid-cap and small-cap stocks.Notable stocks such as Wipro, HDFC Life Insurance, Infosys, LTI Mindtree, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserv, TCS, Reliance Industries, HCL Technologies, HDFC Bank, Hindustan Unilever, and Tata Steel have witnessed declines ranging from 5% to 39% in the past two years.

It has backed the board appointments of his twin-elder siblings, Isha and Akash Ambani — both 31 — in the shareholder vote that will close on Oct. 26. Anant is 28 years old.ISS’s objections echo the recommendations from Mumbai-based Institutional Investor Advisory Services, or IIAS, which said in an Oct. 9 report, that “at 28 years of age,” appointment of the young Ambani scion “does not align with our voting guidelines.” IIAS has supported the proposals seeking to elect Isha and Akash. Reliance did not respond to Bloomberg’s queries but told the proxy companies that Anant has “the relevant experience and maturity to add value to the board deliberations” given his participation in the conglomerate’s businesses and the grooming he has received from senior leadership over the years. Both ISS and IIAS added Reliance’s response to their reports. Another international proxy firm, Glass Lewis, is in favor of Anant’s appointment. “We do not single out Anant Ambani from the other siblings based on experience,” Decky Windarto, Glass Lewis’s director of Asia-Pacific Research, said in an emailed response. “We noted that the other two directors up for election are just three years older than Anant, with similar professional experiences.”While the induction of Anant and his siblings as non-executive, non-independent directors, is critical to the succession plan announced by Asia’s richest person, the counterpoints from proxy advisories show that Ambani and the “next-generation” leaders at $190 billion group will continue to be in focus for corporate governance watchers.Evolving ExpectationsThe recommendations from ISS and IIAS also point to the evolving investor expectations from a conglomerate that now counts Google and Meta Platforms Inc. among marquee investors in its consumer businesses.Reliance’s founders own over 41% shares in the company, making them the single largest voting chunk. The three resolutions need a majority of votes cast to go through. Foreign and local institutions, that often vote based on proxy firms’ recommendations, own close to 40% in Reliance. Their stance will be known after the voting closes. Succession is a crucial issue for the billionaire. Ambani, who was appointed to the Reliance board in 1977 at the age of 20, had to tackle a bitter fraternal feud after his father died without a will in 2002. From Reliance investors’ viewpoint, the leadership transition is critical as the fossil fuel behemoth transforms into a consumer and technology titan with massive green energy ambitions. Ambani told shareholders in August he intends to helm the company for five years as he prepares his children.Akash has been working at Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. since 2014 and is currently its chairman, said the company notice to shareholders. Isha has been driving the expansion of the retail business as an executive director of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. Both have presented to shareholders at the flagship’s annual shareholder meeting in the past few years. Anant, said to be driving the expansion of energy and materials businesses, especially green energy, has yet to formally address shareholders. Anant has been a member of Reliance’s executive committee, is on the boards of two green energy subsidiaries and “has been part of the decision making for the large strategic investments and partnerships,” according to the company response included in the ISS report.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ambanis-youngest-son-anant-faces-proxy-firms-pushback-on-board-seat/articleshow/104484519.cms,2,2.0

The report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), underscores the environmental advantages of expanding biogas projects, including waste management, reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and enhanced renewable energy production. According to the report's author Purva Jain, an energy analyst at IEEFA, ""Biogas has the potential to replace natural gas and other high-emission fossil fuels. By eliminating carbon dioxide (CO2) and impurities like hydrogen sulfide, its methane content can be upgraded to 90 per cent, making it calorifically equivalent to natural gas. This upgraded biogas, known as biomethane, is pipeline-ready and can be integrated into gas grids as a non-fossil gas, she said. ""By adopting appropriate production methods and addressing methane leaks during production, upgrading, and supply stages, biogas can offer India a cleaner alternative to its reliance on imported natural gas,"" Jain said. Despite its clear advantages, the biogas sector has struggled to gain traction in India. The report identifies several reasons for this, including the absence of a comprehensive market ecosystem, pricing challenges, complex approval processes, and fragmented government support. Jain said the government has begun to address these issues. In 2021, various types of support were consolidated under the National Bioenergy Scheme. ""Moreover, the introduction of the GOBARdhan (Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan) scheme as an umbrella initiative of the government will help in this consolidation. It covers the entire gamut of schemes/policies promoting organic waste conversion to biogas or compressed biogas (CBG),"" she says. The report also highlights recent policy developments, such as revising the compressed biogas rate in response to global gas price increases and plans to mandate natural gas marketing companies to procure five per cent compressed biogas. These measures have reignited private sector interest in compressed biogas, with companies like Reliance Industries Limited and the Adani Group showing strong enthusiasm. However, the report emphasises that the government must do more to fully unlock biogas's potential in India. This includes encouraging increased investments and private sector involvement, improving market viability for CBG and biogas slurry, increasing financial access for biogas plant development, and promoting feedstock mapping for input availability. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that energy crops are not used for biogas, as this can lead to indirect land use changes, as seen with ethanol and biodiesel in Brazil, which can have a detrimental impact on climate and the environment through increased carbon emissions. ""A key step will be to guarantee the offtake of CBG by various natural gas-using industries to expedite the achievement of decarbonization goals. The introduction of take-or-pay arrangements will be a significant move in this direction,"" Jain said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-can-reduce-fossil-fuel-dependence-cut-import-bills-by-29-billion-through-biogas-adoption-report/articleshow/104723283.cms,0,0.0

Reliance Industries is India’s largest company by market value, and its business interests range from petrochemicals refining to wireless communication services and consumer goods. It is expanding rapidly into 5G and venturing into new areas like green energy and financial services.This foray into consumer-facing businesses has led Reliance to embark on a fresh fundraising. Its retail arm sold a stake to Qatar Investment Authority this year and the unit also won an investment from KKR & Co. While borrowing costs in India have increased over the past two years, in tandem with the global rise in interest rates, Reliance Industries has a AAA credit score from India’s Crisil Ratings.

It gave 'Buy' recommendations for eight stocks - Aegis Logistics, Axis Bank, Cipla, DLF, Infosys, Mahindra and Mahindra, Reliance Industries, and SRF. It sees a 10-26 per cent possible return on investments in these recommended stocks over the course of the next 12 months.According to the brokerage, the recent sharp correction in stock prices may reflect growing recognition of short-term and medium-term challenges or a 'natural' correction in the market from 'high' levels.""In our view, large-cap stocks offer better reward-risk balance given more reasonable valuations versus lofty valuations of most mid-and small-cap stocks,"" Kotak Securities said.For Reliance Industries where it sees 26 per cent potential returns, Kotak Securities argued that the Mukesh Ambani company can explore reorganization of the company into three independent entities for its three different business verticals.Reorganization, it said, will help the company in achieving three mutually linked objectives - structure, succession, and segregation.""We assume RIL will list its retailing (Reliance Retail and related entities) and telecommunications (Jio Platforms and related entities) over the next 2-3 years,"" Kotak Securities said.For Mahindra and Mahindra, Kotak Securities pegs 22 per cent returns on investments.""Given the strong order book on account of successful new launches, we expect the automotive segment to deliver a strong performance in the coming quarters,"" the brokerage report said, adding it expects mid-single-digit growth in tractor segment volumes.For Infosys, Kotak Securities said the IT services major will be at the forefront of driving the digital journey of clients.""Infosys' strength in managing the twin journeys of digital transformation and cost takeout will drive growth leadership,"" it noted.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/kotak-securities-picks-eight-stocks-sees-10-26-potential-returns/articleshow/104939355.cms,0,0.0

CEO Vaib,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.” ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,2,2.0

Sony may send a letter stating tha,"The fate of the planned merger between Sony Group Corp’s India unit and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd may be known as early as next week, according to people familiar with the matter, as the companies face a looming deadline to resolve their standoff or scuttle a long-awaited deal to create a $10 billion media giant. Unless the two sides can agree on who’ll lead the merged entity and give the final touches to the merger, Sony is likely to send a letter next week to Zee saying the stipulated demands for the merger couldn’t be met, said the people, who asked not to be named as the information isn’t public. That could be the death knell for the deal since there won’t be enough time to tie all the loose ends by the formal December 21 deadline, the people said. Zee is insisting that its Chief Executive Officer Punit Goenka — also its founder’s son — will helm the new entity, as agreed in the pact signed in 2021, while Sony is wary of his appointment given a regulatory probe against Goenka, the people added. This has created an eleventh-hour tussle in the two-year-old merger plan that has already seen a fair share of drama and delays.A Zee representative, without commenting on the leadership issue, said in an emailed response that the company was “actively engaged” toward the timely completion of all prerequisites for the deal. Zee had already completed most of them and was in touch with Sony “on a regular basis,” he said. Sony’s representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment.The Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets regulator, alleged in June that the Mumbai-based media house faked the recovery of loans to cover private financing deals by its founder, Subhash Chandra. Chandra and his son, Goenka, “abused their position” and siphoned off funds, Sebi said in an interim order. While Goenka got a reprieve from an appellate authority against the Sebi order — it had barred him from being an executive or director position in a listed company — Sony still views the ongoing probe as an overhanging corporate governance issue, the people said. Local newspaper Mint first reported this impasse. Who blinks firstThe last-lap tussle is pushing the merger to the brink of collapse unless one of the partners blinks. The Sony-Zee deal sought to create India’s biggest entertainment company with the financial muscle to challenge global powerhouses, including Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., as well as local conglomerates such as Reliance Industries Ltd. Sony will own a 50.86% stake in the merged entity and Goenka’s family will own 3.99% if the deal goes through, with public shareholders in possession of the remaining stake, according to the 2021 agreement. Sony is not considering an extension of the December 21 deadline, the people said.To be sure, the proposed merger has received almost all regulatory approvals and can still be closed if the two sides expeditiously resolve their issues. They can also request India’s company court for extending the merger deadline. If closed, the transaction will help expand Sony’s media business in the world’s most populous country, with over 75 television channels and a market share of 37%, ahead of Disney-owned Star’s 24%, according to a note from brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.Consolidation is already heating up in the sector with Reliance, which tried to buy out Zee earlier, in advanced talks to buyout Walt Disney Co’s India operations, Bloomberg News reported last month.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sony-zee-merger-risks-collapse-ahead-of-deadline-over-ceo-drama/articleshow/105551588.cms,1,1.0

Located 35 kilometres off the coast of Andhra Pradesh in water depths ranging from 300-3,200 metres, the discoveries in the block are divided into Cluster-1, 2 and 3. Cluster 2 is being put to production first.""Cluster-I consists of three discoveries. FDPs of 2 discoveries were approved in 2019. This project is currently in the development stage,"" he said. ""In Cluster-II, commercial production from one gas field has already commenced from March 2020 and commercial production of crude oil is scheduled for May 2024. The project is likely to achieve full completion by 2024.""In Cluster-III, there is one ultra-deep water gas discovery which would be the second deepest hydrocarbon discovery in the world, when monetised. ""The FDP is scheduled to be submitted by January 2026,"" he said.As per original plans, oil production from Cluster-II should have begun by November 2021, but was delayed because of the pandemic. Thereafter, ONGC set May 2023 as the first Cluster-2 oil production deadline but then extended it to August 2023, then to September 2023, and finally, October 2023.None of the deadlines were met and last month ONGC Director (Production) Pankaj Kumar had stated that oil production would start within November but the company is yet to give an update on it.Teli said after the discoveries are made in any block, operators are required to submit a field development plan (FDP) for approval by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH). ""Thereafter, the operator commences production facility development followed by testing and commercial production,"" he added.ONGC had proposed a FDP for Cluster-II in April 2018, with an estimated capital expenditure of USD 5.07 billion and operational expenditure of USD 5.12 billion over a field life of 16 years.The Cluster-II field is divided into two blocks namely 2A and 2B, which as per the original investment decision were expected to produce 23.52 million metric tonnes of oil and 50.70 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas over the life of the field.Cluster 2A was estimated to contain reserves of 94.26 million tonnes of crude oil and 21.75 bcm of associated gas, while Cluster 2B is estimated to host 51.98 bcm of gas reserves.Cluster 2A was anticipated to produce 77,305 barrels of oil per day (bopd) and associated gas at a rate of 3.81 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) over 15 years.Cluster 2B is expected to produce free gas of 12.75 mmscmd from eight wells and has a 16-year life.But ONGC is projecting a lower output - 45,000 bpd of oil and up to 2.5 mmscmd from Cluster 2A and around 9 mmscmd from Cluster 2B.

The initiative aims to foster the development of an ecosystem where vendor partners can aggregate agricultural residue as raw material for Reliance's CBG production plants throughout India.In a press release, the company highlighted the significant volume of agricultural residue in India, often disposed of through burning due to a lack of processing infrastructure and logistical support. The existing agricultural residue supply chain has been disorganized, with farmers and aggregators lacking proper incentives and financial support.Reliance Industries views this initiative as a crucial element in its net-zero roadmap. The company intends to invest nationwide to produce CBG as an eco-friendly alternative to imported compressed natural gas (CNG) and other fossil fuels, positioning India as a notable bio-fuel source. While CBG technology has advanced, commercialization necessitates new infrastructure and engagement with the value chain, involving farmers across various states, the company release said.Harindra K Tripathi, head of Bio-energy Business at Reliance Industries, emphasized the significance of CBG plants in utilizing organic waste, a major contributor to air pollution. ""Beyond mitigating carbon emissions, the CBG plants will also contribute to the production of Fermented Organic Manure (FOM), enhancing soil fertility and reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers over time,"" Tripathi said.Rajat Verma, managing director and head of Institutional Banking at DBS Bank India, underscored the importance of India's green energy sector in the country's net-zero strategy. He commended Reliance Industries' bold initiative and emphasized the pivotal role of transition financing in enabling businesses to adopt and scale innovative technologies for decarbonization. Over the next five years, Reliance plans to establish approximately 100 CBG plants, consuming over 5.5 million tonnes per annum of agricultural residue and organic waste. This initiative is projected to result in a yearly reduction of nearly 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

The market capitalization of listed government assets almost doubled to around Rs 46.4 lakh crore for the final 10,000 points addition to Sensex. This surge in value has outperformed even leading private companies like Tata Group, Reliance, and the Adani Group.According to an ET analysis, during the 551 trading sessions it took for the Sensex to reach this milestone, the share of state-owned companies in India's total market capitalisation increased to approximately 13%. This reflects investor confidence in the government's reforms-driven agenda for state companies in sectors such as banking, insurance, infrastructure, and manufacturing.

However, some wonder if OpenAI has led to the end of the Metav","The hype around OpenAI refuses to die away. It has moved far away from being marked as ‘a trend’ to become an integral part of people’s lives in a very tangible way. In fact, it’s amazing to see the possibilities individuals are exploring to find solutions from the offerings of OpenAI. Not so interestingly, many people believe this ‘new-tech’ has heralded the end of a tech that was making all the noise not so long back. Hence the frequently asked question, ‘Has OpenAI marked the end of Metaverse?’What we must remember about technology is that it's not a zero-sum game; it thrives on collaboration. The coalescence of old and new tech is what makes our reliance on technology a dynamic force. Emerging innovations don't necessarily render older ones obsolete.Breaking the mythA general perception points toward a ‘sudden’ emergence and rise of OpenAI. For decades, Generative AI has been consistently taking steps to find its footing. Machine Learning has already found its way into business processes. So, one would ask, ‘Why did it come today?’Despite its efficacy, Gen-AI needed something that it until today had struggled to master: context. Unlike human communication, technology thrives on binaries. So, for years, tech developers were busy feeding AI tools, context.Unlike metaverse, which seemed like a lucrative idea, Gen-AI had a foundation of decades to improve and thrive upon consistently.Access & Value-Added ResponsibilityIn terms of technological advancements, there is a verdict usually among the masses that divides them. When Metaverse made its entry, there were skeptics and there were optimists. However, I witnessed during the growth of OpenAI, that the two roles were replaced by: early users and latecomers.Based on a freemium model, ChatGPT’s easy interface and the ability to excite with results captured the attention of millions on a daily basis. When people witnessed the firsthand experience of automation, it became a revelation for them.Many saw in it, ease of work, while certain sections were left in a frenzy, ‘What if AI replaces us?’ Nonetheless, this immediacy of returns from AI, compared to the Metaverse, was enough to spark the growth journey for OpenAI.Community Engagement In A World Seeking AI SolutionsOpenAI actively engaged with its user community for feedback and improvement. This iterative process allowed the system to continuously learn and adapt, making it more valuable and accurate over time.Moreover, OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT coincided with a growing demand for AI-driven solutions to streamline work processes and enhance communication. This alignment with current needs in various industries contributed to its rapid growth.Why ‘AI and Metaverse’ & not ‘AI vs Metaverse’?I believe Metaverse is yet to find its value and its place. It may at present feel like clay moulded into uneven shapes but with time and resources, it will fall into a shape that fits in.The 'AI and Metaverse' approach acknowledges that AI has a pivotal role to play within the Metaverse framework. The creative front led by AI and automation can seamlessly pivot the virtual world toward being more natural and intelligent. Similarly, the Metaverse can serve as a valuable testing ground for AI advancements, allowing them to evolve and mature in a context that mirrors the complexities of real-world interactions.Fostering a collaborative perspective encourages innovation on multiple fronts. The next step…In a world where innovation is driven by collaboration, we can witness AI assisting in the creation of personalized and interactive Metaverse environments. Simultaneously, the Metaverse can serve as a fertile ground for AI to grasp and adapt to the intricacies of human behaviour and interaction.By fostering this harmonious relationship, we set the stage for a technological future that transcends the limitations of individual technologies and embraces their collective potential.By Piyush Jha, managing director & head – India & APAC, GlobalLogic",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/technology-is-not-a-zero-sum-game/articleshow/106355515.cms,2,2.0

Here's what you need to know.","Zee Entertainment share price today: Shares of Zee Entertainment witnessed a significant and closed the down 32.73% on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The shares reached the lower circuit of Rs 152.50 intraday. This drop came in the wake of brokerages downgrading the media stock, reacting to the abrupt end of the prolonged drama surrounding the expected $10-billion merger with Sony.With the merger officially called off, brokerages such as CLSA have swiftly downgraded Zee from a ""BUY"" to a ""SELL,"" revising the target price from Rs 300 to Rs 198, according to an ET report. The sector is expected to witness increased competition, especially with the reported merger of Reliance and Disney Star.Analysts predict that Zee's near-term valuation will remain subdued due to various factors, including Sony seeking a termination fee, uncertainties about Zee's new strategy and partners, and the actions of its minority stakeholders. 107064850Nuvama has adjusted its FY25E/26E EPS on Zee, reducing it by 16%/24%, and downgraded the stock to ""reduce"" with a target price of Rs 190. Elara and Motilal Oswal have also downgraded Zee, setting target prices of Rs 170 and Rs 200, respectively.Motilal Oswal expressed concerns about the lack of clarity on Zee's future direction. The company's recovery in earnings is not expected in the near term, and uncertainties regarding the litigation with Sony further complicate matters, it said.Facing fierce competition from digital media and the potential threat from the RIL-Disney merger, Zee has reported muted growth and profitability in the past two years. Losses in the OTT segment and lower growth in the linear TV segment have contributed to a dip in the EBITDA margin to 10.7%. 107067209Elara was quoted saying that the possibility of Zee's target price falling to as low as Rs 130 if the company honors its contract with Disney for the sub-franchise of ICC tournaments on linear TV. The broadcasting business and OTT segment were valued at 10x one-year forward P/E and 3.0x one-year forward EV/sales, respectively, Elara said.In a shifting industry landscape towards OTT, Zee5 is perceived to be on weak footing, competing against strong players like Disney, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Network18 led by Reliance Industries. Amidst the turmoil, Sony is seeking a termination fee of $90 million from Zee, leading to a legal dispute as Zee refutes the claims and plans to contest them in arbitration proceedings.Experts advise avoiding Zee shares - here’s whyAnalysts have warned against buying shares in the hopes of the price bottoming out during the current market downturn, following the failed merger with Sony. This merger was seen as a potential lifeline for Zee, which is grappling with ongoing crises and a decline in market share. 107074334In the last month, Zee's stock has dropped by 15%, contrasting with the 1% gain in the Nifty index, primarily due to uncertainties related to the unsuccessful merger. After the deal announcement in December 2021, Zee shares had surged from around Rs 170 to about Rs 370.As of December 2023, foreign institutional investors held 28.19% of the company, domestic institutional investors held 43.42%, and retail investors had 24.24%. Notable shareholders, such as ICICI Prudential, Nippon India, and HDFC MF, owned stakes ranging from 5.26% to 7.25%, and Life Insurance Corporation of India held 5.12%.The failure of the merger has broader implications, as it was considered advantageous for both Zee and Sony, particularly in light of industry dynamics following the Disney-Viacom merger.

After the announcement of the termination by Sony, a host of brokerages changed their stance on Zee and downgraded the stock.The stock opened at Rs 209 - down the maximum 10% slide possible during initial trades - and lost value through the session to hit an intra-day low of Rs 153.

Competition in the broadcasting sector (where Reliance Industries inked a deal to merge Disney's India properties with itself), corporate governance issues and low promoter holding (down to 4% from 41% five years ago) are some challenges flagged by the CLSA report. It has put a price target of Rs 198 for Zee.Another report by domestic broking house Nuvama pointed out that Zee's near-term valuation shall stay suppressed due to ""Sony seeking a termination fee, uncertainty with respect to Zee's new strategy and partners, and action of its minority stakeholders"".

The valuation of Disney's India unit is sharply lower than the $15-$16 billion estimated when Disney acquired it in 2019. Disney's TV and streaming business in India has struggled over the years, with its digital platform facing a user exodus in stiff competition over cricket streaming with Ambani's platform. The deal will strengthen Reliance's hold over India's $28 billion media and entertainment market, especially after a separate $10 billion merger deal between Japan's Sony and India's Zee Entertainment collapsed last week.  The three sources said Bodhi Tree, a joint venture between James Murdoch and former top Disney executive, Uday Shankar, is also set to take a stake of around 9% in the new merged entity. Disney will hold around 40%. Reliance, Disney and Bodhi Tree did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Reliance and Disney, which each have a streaming service as well as 120 television channels between them, have been in talks for months to create an entertainment superpower in the world's most populous nation.  Under the deal being discussed, Viacom18, the broadcast division of Ambani's Reliance Industries, will merge with Disney's India businesses. Viacom18's shareholders include Paramount Global as well as Bodhi Tree, which invested $500 million in the Indian company last April. Shankar also serves on Viacom18's board. Two of the sources said the final percentage stake numbers could change. The sources declined to be identified because the talks are confidential. A deal could be closed by mid-February, the sources said. One of the executives said Viacom18 was also likely to infuse some cash in the merged entity. The third source said the deal talks were in advanced stages and some tax related matters were still being ironed out, though broad contours were almost finalised.  Antitrust and Cricket rights A Disney-Reliance merger could face many antitrust challenges due to the market power they could wield, especially as Sony and Zee were close to a separate merged entity in India.  Those regulatory hurdles may now ease. ""With the collapse of the Zee-Sony merger, the market will now be less concentrated, making it easier for Disney-Reliance,"" said Karan Singh Chandhiok, head of competition law at Indian law firm Chandhiok & Mahajan. In India, despite its large population with growing incomes, the Burbank-headquartered entertainment giant has struggled to make money. Its streaming service makes less than a tenth of its Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) there compared to the United States and other international markets. The US firm's streaming service lost nearly 34% of its subscribers between October 2022 and August 2023, as Ambani started offering free cricket on his new streaming platform after out-bidding Disney for the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament rights.  Several top Disney India executives have joined Viacom18 in recent months. Disney misjudged Indians' willingness to pay, Disney sources have said, and the company recently changed tack by offering free cricket on smartphones, hoping the strategy will boost advertising revenue and offset the impact of a subscriber exodus, Reuters reported.  In November, Disney CEO Bob Iger said Disney's TV channels were doing well in India, but other parts of the business were struggling and it was seeking to ""improve the bottom line.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-bodhi-tree-set-for-60-stake-in-disney-india-merger-sources/articleshow/107328442.cms,1,1.0

This mandate will result in the cancellation of approximately 40 flights, impacting airlines like IndiGo and Air India. Additionally, the extension of the curfew on business jets has drawn criticism from corporate giants.","The government has asked Mumbai airport to reduce the number of scheduled flights and restrict the movement of business jets during rush hours in a bid to reduce congestion and improve on-time departures. The move will force airlines to cut some 40 flights and hit operations of private jets which is used by some of the country's top business houses. The Airport Authority of India, which handles air navigation services, has asked the airport to reduce aircraft movement from 46 to 44 during rush hour and from 44 to 42 during non-peak hours.The direction to reduce the number of flights will force airlines to cut around 40 flights from the middle of this week, industry executives familiar with the matter said. IndiGo, which operates the highest number of flights, will have to reduce 18 flights while the Air India group including Vistara will have to cut 17, executives said.Simultaneously, the curfew on operation of business jets has been extended from four hours to eight hours, leading to protests from top corporate groups such as Reliance Industries, JSW and the Mahindra group.Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), which operates the airport, didn’t comment till press time.The airport, owned by the Adani group, is the second busiest in the country after Delhi and sees heavy movement of business jets. It operates more flights than any airport with a single runway and in December, handled its highest-monthly traffic of 4.88 million passengers.People aware of the development said that the decision was taken after civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia raised concerns over the plummeting on-time departure numbers at the airport.107639301Senior air traffic controllers termed the leading cause of delay to overscheduling by airlines amid increasing demand for air travel this year.“Runway capacity is the sum of multiple things like availability of infrastructure such as parking stands and the time taken by the aircraft to vacate the runway. The airport had given slots to airlines considering the peak handling capacity. But for instance, if an aircraft is pushing back from one bay, the aircraft in the adjacent parking bay cannot move despite being ready to take off,” a government official said. “Also, in a city like Mumbai, there are multiple unscheduled movements like aircraft of government and business houses which sometimes delays scheduled flights.”He added that the government has also asked airports that from the upcoming summer schedule, they should factor in unforeseen circumstances while forecasting peak hour capacity.Airline network planners said that such sudden cancellations hurt their ability to redeploy the aircraft, leading to losses. “Airlines will have to shell out a substantial amount to passengers as compensation,” said an airline executive.Rajesh Bali, managing director of Business Aircraft Operator Association, said that the extra restriction on business jets is concerning as corporate leaders who rely on private jets for their travel needs already had limited slots to operate. “The new restrictions will significantly hamper business aviation operations, affecting the functionality of Mumbai as the commercial hub of the nation,” he said.Air traffic has increased exponentially after COVID with passenger traffic surpassing pre-pandemic records. But every major airport has seen severe congestion, leading to public outcry.Aviation security regulator BCAS has mandated that any addition of new flights at airports has to be based on passenger-handling capacity at security checkpoints. BCAS has set a standard saying that each X-ray machine can handle a maximum of 180 passengers per hour on the domestic side and 160 passengers on the international side.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/government-asks-mumbai-airport-to-reduce-flights-to-ease-congestion/articleshow/107637339.cms,1,1.0

Started in 1966 as a small textile manufacturer by Dhirubhai Ambani, RIL introduced the equity culture in India with its IPO in 1977. The company morphed into a conglomerate with interests in petrochemicals, oil & gas, retail, telecom and financial services, making shareholders crorepatis. 107671489RIL touched the Rs 1-lakh-crore market cap mark for the first time on Aug 2, 2005. On the same day, India's (or BSE's) market cap, too, crossed the Rs 20-lakh-crore milestone for the first time. RIL is now worth what all Indian companies put together were about 19 years ago. Its ability to grow and diversify at a fast clip at its scale has meant that its share in India's market cap is unchanged since 2005 at 5%. 107671558RIL, which has been the most valued company in India for over a decade, is now ranked (44th) among the world's top 50 companies in terms of market cap. RIL was also the first Indian company to reach the Rs 10-lakh-crore market cap mark on Nov 28, 2019. While it took 14 years to go from a market cap of Rs 1 lakh crore to Rs 10 lakh crore, the Rs 10 lakh crore to Rs 20 lakh crore journey needed just over four years.In India, RIL is ahead of TCS - the country's second most valued company - by Rs 5 lakh crore (see graphic). Among global oil & gas peers, RIL ($239 billion) lags Aramco ($2 trillion), Exxon Mobil ($410 billion) & Chevron ($287 billion) but beats Shell ($205 billion) and PetroChina ($202 billion), Bloomberg data showed. 107671603RIL grew during the the first 40 years with forward and backward integrations, like setting up refineries and petrochemicals plants.

After India's most valued stock touched the Rs 20 lakh crore milestone this week, it is now bigger than the likes of American MNC giants like McDonald's, PepsiCo, Netflix and Accenture.Shareholders of RIL, which was worth just Rs 1 lakh crore in August 2005, have made a notional profit of Rs 19 lakh crore in a span of less than 19 years.RIL hit the Rs 5 lakh crore m-cap feat in July 2017, Rs 10 lakh crore in November 2019, and Rs 15 lakh crore in September 2021 while the Rs 20 lakh crore landmark was achieved on 13 February 2024.     107712465With analysts expecting 2024 to be an eventful year for RIL as the past two years of investments move into the monetization phase, stock prices have jumped 28% in the last 3 months alone.The peerless conglomerate can't be compared to other listed or unlisted companies in India because it houses well-diversified businesses of petrochemicals, new energy, telecom and retail.

Calculations done by ICICI Securities shows that RIL could make it by 2032 if its profit growth trajectory jumps up to about 21% against 10-year PAT CAGR of 13%, assuming no PE re-rating. The macro framework is based on the assumption of reaching peak corporate profitability (~7% ‘PAT/GDP’ ratio) in the listed space driven by gradual advancement towards peak GDP growth of ~9%. Other key assumptions include – ratio of the largest stock’s m-cap to aggregate m-cap sustaining at long-term average of 5-6% and no re-rating in P/E ratios from current levels,  said Vinod Karki of ICICI Securities.Based on the historical average number of companies with market value greater than a-tenth of the top company’s m-cap, it is likely that around 30-40 stocks with $100 billion size may exist in 2032, he said.What's next for RIL?RIL's Q3 results showed that its capex at $3.6 billion fell 22% quarter-on-quarter to 2-year-low as Jio's capex declined on completion of 5G pan India rollout. Retail capex was also low on muted new store rollout. We think investment cycles will be shorter than in the past two decades, with limited impact on balance sheet leverage. The key to watch will be the startup of revenues from the new energy vertical, which we believe remains most underappreciated in NAV,  Morgan Stanley's Mayank Maheshwari.A turn in the chemical cycle, a golden age for refining, traction in 5G subscribers and a slowdown in investments in retail could be among key events that garner investor traction, he said.RIL will also benefit from its robust free cash flow generation of Rs 30,000 crore in FY25, declining capex levels to Rs 1.25 lakh crore and declining debt levels to Rs 2.72 lakh crore. Commencement of new energy operations will be a key event in coming quarters for RIL, analysts say.It is expected that Jio may opt for a tariff hike after the Lok Sabha elections while retail will see revenue per square foot improving as store additions slow and older stores mature.If RIL becomes India’s first $1 trillion stock, the personal wealth of the Ambani family will also zoom as they own more than half of the conglomerate.(Data: Ritesh Presswala)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

In a video played before delegates, a motorcycle mechanic in southern India queried an AI bot in his native Tamil, a banker conversed with the tool in Hindi, and a developer in Hyderabad used it to write computer code.If successful, the model — dubbed Hanooman — will represent an advance for India in the accelerating race to develop potentially transformative AI technology. BharatGPT envisions the model working via 11 local languages in four main fields: health care, governance, financial services and education. It developed the model in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology universities including in Bombay, backed by wireless carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. and India’s government. A swath of startups such as Sarvam and Krutrim, backed by prominent VC investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners and billionaire Vinod Khosla’s fund, are also building open-sourced AI models customized for India. While Silicon Valley companies like OpenAI are building ever-larger LLMs, those efforts involve workarounds because of computational constraints and simpler models affordable to smaller businesses and government departments.“It’s a different genre of LLMs,” said Ganesh Ramakrishnan, chair of IIT Bombay’s department of computer science and engineering. Hanooman will also offer speech-to-text capabilities, making it vastly more user-friendly, he said in an interview on the sidelines of the annual Nasscom IT industry conference. In a country of 1.4 billion, millions cannot read or write.Reliance Jio will build customized models for specific uses, he said. The telecom-to-retail conglomerate is already working on Jio Brain, a platform to use AI across a network of about 450 million subscribers. LLMs are systems that learn from vast quantities of data and generate natural-sounding responses. Such models harness generative AI, a newer type of artificial intelligence popularized by the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.BharatGPT’s effort in this space is somewhat unique — it’s the first private-public partnership of its kind in the country, and involves major players in disparate fields.“It’s like the Indian joint family,” Ramakrishnan said, referring to inter-generational family structures still common in the country. “We are interdependent, and we do better together.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bharatgpt-ai-model-backed-by-mukesh-ambani-asias-richest-person-to-launch-in-march/articleshow/107871100.cms,2,1.5

In a video played before delegates, a motorcycle mechanic in southern India queried an AI bot in Tamil, a banker conversed with the tool in Hindi, and a developer in Hyderabad used it to write computer code.107893392If successful, the model - dubbed Hanooman - will represent an advance for India in the accelerating race to develop potentially transformative AI technology. BharatGPT envisions the model working via 11 local languages in four main fields: health care, governance, financial services and education. It developed the model in collaboration with the IITs including in Bombay, backed by wireless carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm and govt.A swath of startups such as Sarvam and Krutrim, backed by prominent VC investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners and billionaire Vinod Khosla's fund, are also building open-sourced AI models customised for India. While Silicon Valley companies like OpenAI are building ever-larger LLMs, those efforts involve workarounds because of computational constraints and simpler models affordable to smaller businesses and govt departments. ""It's a different genre of LLMs,"" said Ganesh Ramakrishnan, chair of IIT Bombay's department of computer science and engineering. Hanooman will also offer speech-to-text capabilities, making it vastly more user-friendly, he said in an interview on the sidelines of the Nasscom IT industry conference.

Vantara aims at focusing on the rescue, treatment, rehabilitation, and care of injured or abused animals. Anant envisions Vantara to be the world's most advanced wildlife institute and aims to conserve and breed critically endangered species.","The year 2024 seems to be a promising year for the youngest son of Reliance Industries Chairman- Mukesh Ambani and his wife Nita Ambani- who is the Founder and Chairperson of Reliance Foundation, Anant Ambani. Ahead of his pre-wedding celebrations in Jamnagar, which will be held between March 1 to 3, Anant Ambani spoke about his most passionate project Vantara at a press conference in Gujarat's Jamnagar.Spread across 3000 acres within Relianceâs Jamnagar Refinery Complex's Green Belt, Vantara is an ambitious project helmed by Anant Ambani-- who is the Director at Reliance Industries. Vantara, which means star of the forest, aims at focussing on the rescue, treatment, rehabilitation, and care of injured or abused animals.Talking about the initiative and what inspired him to set up Vantara, Anant Ambani said at a press conference today, ""I have been taking care of animals ever since my childhood days because my parents told me that those who help the voiceless animals get immensely blessed in return... Even in our Hindu religion, it is said that Shri Ram helped and took care of Jatayu. Shri Ram also took care of a small squirrel and it too blessed him in return."" 108021207Anant further shared that in Hinduism every deity has an animal that is close to them, and the concept of their vahana. He also said that he sees God with animals. ""Mata Rani sits on a lion, Goddess Laxmi likes owls, Saraswati's Vahan is a peacock... For Shri Krishna, it is often said-- hathi, ghoda, palki, jai kanhaiya lal ki! In Hindu dharma it is also said that animals are sacred to us and they represent Gods and Goddesses,"" he said.Meanwhile, in an interview with CNN-News18âs Anand Narasimhan, Anant revealed that they have over 200 rescued elephants from all across India at Vantara, where they are being taken care of by over 300-400 professionals. They also have 50-60 endangered species kept at Vantara.""Yes, that we've been rescued. From various backgrounds, like circuses, road accidents, animal-human conflicts, from zoos that are overcrowded. We have rescued animals from all across, from hunting lodges in South Africa and from other places. So while we were rescuing them, I thought that we needed a state-of-the-art hospital. We need a state-of-the-art facility. I donât want to keep them in cages. I want to keep them in their natural habitat... We have mimicked the natural habitat to the T, to the best of my ability. And my team is more important than me. Thereâs a trust, and the trust runs it. So the team has created a wildlife sanctuary, and each enclosure has its biodiversity, from the plants to the water body to even the rocks. The logs are originally from where the animals came from. Our focus is that India should not have any wild animals suffering in captivity, or any wild animals should not go without being treated,"" Anant told CNN-News18.Talking about his vision for Vantara, Anant further said in the interview, ""My vision is that at Vantara in Jamnagar, we would like to be the worldâs most advanced wildlife institute and we would also like to conserve and breed critically endangered species so we can release them back in the habitat. Because a lot of species, even today, as we speak, are going extinct.""Vantara is a not-for-profit endeavour that is said to house over 10,000 people at its rescue center. It is being run under the leadership of Anant Ambani, who is all set to tie the knot with Radhika Merchant on July 12, 2024.
