This suggests that a buyer of an electoral bond could have a ready secondary market that values the bond much higher than its face value.

The State Bank of India has sought an extension till June 30 to disclose the details of each electoral bond encashed by political parties before the scheme was scrapped.  A separate plea, seeking initiation of contempt action against the SBI is also being heard.\n",

Sibal, who led the argument for the petitioners in the Supreme Court case against the electoral bond scheme, said the State Bank of India (SBI) claiming that it would take several weeks to make the data public sounds like “somebody wants to protect somebody”.  In a video interview with PTI, Sibal claimed it was clear that the SBI intended to protect the government. Otherwise, the bank would not have filed an application seeking an extension till June 30 in disclosing electoral bond details when elections are set to take place in April-May, he said. The senior advocate’s remarks assume significance as they come ahead of a hearing by a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court on SBI’s application seeking an extension to disclose the details of each electoral bond encashed by political parties before the scheme was scrapped last month.  The bench, headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, will also hear a separate plea which has sought the initiation of contempt action against the bank for “wilfully and deliberately” disobeying the apex court’s direction to submit details of the contributions made to political parties through electoral bonds to the Election Commission by March 6.  Sibal said the SBI knows that elections are in April-May and throughout the period after the election is announced, it would be a subject matter of public debate if the details of the electoral bonds are made public.  “They are seeking time and the reasons are obvious and I am sure that the court will see through them. It is puerile for the organisation (SBI) to say that we will have to collate the material, collect the files and then we will have to find out who gave money to whom..this is the 21st century and our dear PM (Narendra Modi) talks about the digitalisation of everything,” he said.  Asked about the plea that has sought contempt action against the SBI, Sibal said these are matters on which contempt should be left to the courts. “This impacts the dignity of the court. It is the court which is responsible for protecting its dignity. If the court is seen to be accepting this specious explanation given by the SBI, which is ex-facie and something laughable, then it is for the court to decide how it will protect its orders,” the senior advocate said.  “The fact that the SBI has filed an application itself is probably because it is hoping that the court would relent, but my understanding is that once a constitutional bench has rendered a judgement, it is not going to be easy for the court to say ‘we’ll accept what you say’, but that is for the court to decide,” Sibal said.  On whether the Supreme Court’s verdict declaring the electoral bonds unconstitutional corrects the nixing of the level playing field, Sibal said it has still not been corrected.  However, he argued that the court could not have done anything about it at this stage. “The fact of the matter is that the BJP has in that process enjoyed over Rs 6,000 crore of white money, which is huge in the context of what they can do with those Rs 6,000 crore in the course of an election. So obviously, it (electoral bond scheme) has resulted in a non-level playing field,” Sibal said.  The whole scheme was conceived with a political motive for aggrandising the BJP and making them the richest party in the world, the Independent MP said.  He also claimed that the intent of the scheme as set out in 2017 was to ensure that the money comes into the coffers of the government in power at the Centre.  Sibal said that with probe agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate and the CBI behaving the way they have done in the last few years, they will be targeting the opposition parties and leaders once the details of the electoral bonds are out before June. “My worry is in fact that taken to its logical conclusion with the ED being with them and the CBI being part of the so-called establishment, they will be targeting the opposition, and it will create another level of non-level playing field,” he added.  Sibal further said that the opposition parties should have together raised the issue of electoral bonds to corner the government after the Supreme Court verdict.  He, however, acknowledged that the opposition parties were too involved in trying to settle the seat-sharing issue.  “Fundamentally, that (sharing of seats) is more important for the reason that elections are round the corner, but I think this (electoral bonds) will be a big issue in these elections,” the MP said. “I hope the Supreme Court stands by its direction. If they get the names, then it will be a big issue,” he added.  On February 15, a five-judge Constitution bench scrapped the Centre’s electoral bonds scheme of anonymous political funding, calling it “unconstitutional” and ordering disclosure by the Election Commission of the donors, the amount donated by them and the recipients by March 13.  Ordering the closure of the scheme, the top court directed the SBI to submit by March 6 the details of the electoral bonds purchased since April 12, 2019, till date to the Election Commission, which was asked to publish the information on its official website by March 13.

      "The State Bank of India (SBI) had on Monday moved the Supreme Court seeking an extension of time till June 30 to disclose details of each electoral bond encashed by the political parties.\n",
      "The State Bank of India has not shared details of the electoral bonds encashed by political parties till Wednesday, the deadline set by the Supreme Court. The State Bank of India (SBI) had on Monday moved the Supreme Court seeking an extension of time till June 30 to disclose details of each electoral bond encashed by the political parties.  The SBI's plea has not been listed for hearing by the apex court so far. Sources said that no details have been shared with the poll panel. Sources said that no details have been shared with the poll panel.  Last month, a five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud had struck down electoral bonds scheme and directed the SBI to disclose details of each electoral bond encashed by the political parties. The information should include the date of encashment and the denomination of the bonds and be submitted to the poll panel by March 6.  In its application before the apex court, the SBI had contended that retrieval of information from &quot;each silo&quot; and the procedure of matching the information of one silo to that of the other would be a time-consuming exercise. The bench had also said that the Election Commission (EC) should publish the information shared by the SBI on its official website by March 13.  An Election Commission spokesperson said that there was no information or comments to offer on the issue.\n",

Major challenges include rising pressure on the cost of funds, due to structural funding challenges, and growing concerns on rising consumer leverage, which poses potential asset quality challenges. In unsecured lending, particularly, this could lead to higher credit costs. Further, banks could feel the pressure on operating costs due to elevated wage inflation, and also need to expand the distribution network for future deposit growth, said Goldman Sachs.  Also Read:\\xa0Private capex is seeing action heat up, here’s a road map for investors  Domestic banks recorded a sharp ROA (return on assets) expansion in FY20-3QFY24. Now, the brokerage believes that ROAs will start moderating due to continued pressure on margins which are expected to extend to FY25, slower loan growth as loan-deposit ratios are stretched and that the sector will have to repair its balance-sheet mix and this, coupled with the need of building capacity, should keep cost-to-income levels elevated.  “We believe all players face the dilemma of maintaining market share or compromising margins amidst the backdrop of stronger balance sheets across the system,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs Equity Research.  However, the brokerage said that an earlier-than-expected cut in policy rates would alleviate liquidity concerns in the system or any measures by the central bank to ease the liquidity through CRR/SLR should aid in deposit growth and would augur well for all private banks in particular which are currently constrained with stretched loans-to-deposit ratios and limited buffers on liquidity coverage ratios and, to a certain extent, for NBFCs which are witnessing an environment of elevated costs of funds due to liquidity tightness.  Goldman Sachs upgraded Bajaj Finance to ‘neutral’ from ‘sell’ (2 percent upside) and reiterated the ‘buy’ call on HDFC Bank (33 percent upside).  Brokerage Call  SBI: Neutral - CMP: Rs 766.95 - Target Price: Rs 741  Goldman Sachs cut State Bank of India’s earnings by 7 percent and 5 percent over FY25E/26E mainly on account of a higher cost of funds and now expects the ROA of the bank to be &amp;lt;1 percent over FY25-26E.  “Since we added the stock to our Buy list on Aug 24 2020, the stock is up 283 percent vs the BSE30 +87 percent. At the current valuation of 1.2x on a 1-yr fwd P/B basis (standalone) and the dynamics around profitability, we believe the stock is trading at a fair valuation. Based on our valuation methodology, we raise our 12-month target price to Rs 741 per share,” the brokerage said while downgrading the stock to ‘Neutral’.  ICICI Bank: Neutral - CMP: Rs 1,061.55 - Target Price: Rs 1,086  “While ICICI Bank has been quite successful in scaling up its ROAs post Covid driven by its shift towards a higher-yielding mix, digital banking which also allowed it to scale up its consumer lending, diversification into SME lending etc, we expect the consumer lending to go through consolidation and hence expect ICICI Bank’s profitability to also moderate,” said Goldman Sachs.  Also Read: Global stocks set for gains, not fireworks, in months ahead: Poll  ICICI Bank has grown its unsecured book quite aggressively (25 percent of incremental loan growth over FY22-23) and with rising delinquencies in this book, the brokerage expects it to also impact its operating profit growth (due to income reversals).  “Since we added it to our buy list on 23 Oct 2016, the stock has risen 315 percent vs the BSE 30 Sensex of 160 percent. We revise our 12-month SOTP to Rs 1,086 from Rs 1,179 and downgrade the stock to ‘Neutral’ from ‘Buy’,” Goldman Sachs said.  Yes Bank: Sell - CMP: Rs 27.25 - Target Price: Rs 16  The stock has rallied 36 percent over the last 3 months and 65 percent over the last 12 months vs Bank Nifty's performance of\\xa0 +7%/17%. However, the fundamentals have been under pressure due to its subdued margin profile as well as a bottoming of credit cost improvements.  “We believe its ROEs are going to remain sub-par despite improvements due to the above-mentioned challenges and hence the current valuations appear rich. As a result, we downgrade to ‘Sell’ from ‘Neutral’. We cut EPS by 43 percent in FY25 and BVPS by 6.6 percent but maintain our 12-month target price at Rs 16,” said Goldman Sachs.

      "Goldman downgrades ratings of SBI, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank, warns of stronger headwinds\n",
      "Goldman Sachs downgraded State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank, saying that the ‘Goldilocks period’ is over for the financial sector\n",
      "Global brokerage firm Goldman Sachs has downgraded banking giants State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank, saying that the Goldilocks period of strong growth and strong or visible profitability was over for the financial sector for the near term. It added that headwinds were intensifying for the Indian financial services sector.  Major challenges include rising pressure on the cost of funds, due to structural funding challenges, and growing concerns on rising consumer leverage, which poses potential asset quality challenges. In unsecured lending, particularly, this could lead to higher credit costs. Further, banks could feel the pressure on operating costs due to elevated wage inflation, and also need to expand the distribution network for future deposit growth, said Goldman Sachs.  Also Read: Private capex is seeing action heat up, here’s a road map for investors  Domestic banks recorded a sharp ROA (return on assets) expansion in FY20-3QFY24. Now, the brokerage believes that ROAs will start moderating due to continued pressure on margins which are expected to extend to FY25, slower loan growth as loan-deposit ratios are stretched and that the sector will have to repair its balance-sheet mix and this, coupled with the need of building capacity, should keep cost-to-income levels elevated.  “We believe all players face the dilemma of maintaining market share or compromising margins amidst the backdrop of stronger balance sheets across the system,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs Equity Research.  However, the brokerage said that an earlier-than-expected cut in policy rates would alleviate liquidity concerns in the system or any measures by the central bank to ease the liquidity through CRR/SLR should aid in deposit growth and would augur well for all private banks in particular which are currently constrained with stretched loans-to-deposit ratios and limited buffers on liquidity coverage ratios and, to a certain extent, for NBFCs which are witnessing an environment of elevated costs of funds due to liquidity tightness.  Goldman Sachs upgraded Bajaj Finance to ‘neutral’ from ‘sell’ (2 percent upside) and reiterated the ‘buy’ call on HDFC Bank (33 percent upside).  Brokerage Call  SBI: Neutral - CMP: Rs 766.95 - Target Price: Rs 741  Goldman Sachs cut State Bank of India’s earnings by 7 percent and 5 percent over FY25E/26E mainly on account of a higher cost of funds and now expects the ROA of the bank to be &amp;lt;1 percent over FY25-26E.  “Since we added the stock to our Buy list on Aug 24 2020, the stock is up 283 percent vs the BSE30 +87 percent. At the current valuation of 1.2x on a 1-yr fwd P/B basis (standalone) and the dynamics around profitability, we believe the stock is trading at a fair valuation. Based on our valuation methodology, we raise our 12-month target price to Rs 741 per share,” the brokerage said while downgrading the stock to ‘Neutral’.  ICICI Bank: Neutral - CMP: Rs 1,061.55 - Target Price: Rs 1,086  “While ICICI Bank has been quite successful in scaling up its ROAs post Covid driven by its shift towards a higher-yielding mix, digital banking which also allowed it to scale up its consumer lending, diversification into SME lending etc, we expect the consumer lending to go through consolidation and hence expect ICICI Bank’s profitability to also moderate,” said Goldman Sachs.  Also Read: Global stocks set for gains, not fireworks, in months ahead: Poll  ICICI Bank has grown its unsecured book quite aggressively (25 percent of incremental loan growth over FY22-23) and with rising delinquencies in this book, the brokerage expects it to also impact its operating profit growth (due to income reversals).  “Since we added it to our buy list on 23 Oct 2016, the stock has risen 315 percent vs the BSE 30 Sensex of 160 percent. We revise our 12-month SOTP to Rs 1,086 from Rs 1,179 and downgrade the stock to ‘Neutral’ from ‘Buy’,” Goldman Sachs said.  Yes Bank: Sell - CMP: Rs 27.25 - Target Price: Rs 16  The stock has rallied 36 percent over the last 3 months and 65 percent over the last 12 months vs Bank Nifty's performance of  +7%/17%. However, the fundamentals have been under pressure due to its subdued margin profile as well as a bottoming of credit cost improvements.  “We believe its ROEs are going to remain sub-par despite improvements due to the above-mentioned challenges and hence the current valuations appear rich. As a result, we downgrade to ‘Sell’ from ‘Neutral’. We cut EPS by 43 percent in FY25 and BVPS by 6.6 percent but maintain our 12-month target price at Rs 16,” said Goldman Sachs.

      "SBI denies reports on Yes Bank stake sale\n",
      "Earlier, media reports said that SBI is likely to sell its entire stake in Yes Bank, with a block deal being the preferred mode of sale.\n",
      "The State Bank of India (SBI) on February 8 issued a clarification, denying reports of a stake sale in private lender Yes Bank.  In a communication to exchanges, the country’s largest lender said that reports are factually incorrect.  Earlier, media reports said that SBI is likely to sell its entire stake in Yes Bank, with a block deal being the preferred mode of sale. The bank may look to sell Yes Bank shares worth Rs 5,000-Rs 7,000 crore via the block deal, with no taxes applicable on the sale, according to the media reports.  Yes Bank also clarified that it was not engaged in any negotiations related to SBI's stake sale via a block deal.  &quot;The bank would like to clarify that the news appears to be speculative. The bank is not involved in any negotiations concerning the subject of the news. Hence, the bank is unable to comment on the said article and its impact,&quot; Yes Bank said in a separate exchange filing.  ALSO READ: Yes Bank stock eases from day's high as it denies reports of any potential stake sale by SBI  In July 2022, Yes Bank's board proposed to exit the reconstruction scheme. Under the scheme in March 2020, eight banks led by SBI acquired stakes in the private lender. As of December 2023, SBI holds 26.13 percent, HDFC Ltd holds 3 percent, and ICICI Bank holds 2.61 percent equity in Yes Bank.  In March 2020, the RBI had taken over YES Bank, appointing former SBI CFO Prashant Kumar as the administrator due to the bank's financial troubles, including mounting bad loans and challenges in raising capital. Governance issues further contributed to the decline in the bank's financial position in 2020.\n",

The state-run lender's overall earnings, however, remained healthy, driven by lower credit costs, despite weak core operating performance, which attracted bullish calls from brokerages. Analysts believe that SBI is well-placed amid tight liquidity.  For the quarter ended December 2023, the bank's net profit fell 35 percent on-year to Rs 9,163 crore\\xa0under Rs 7,100-crore pension liabilities. The net interest income (NII) of the country's largest bank came in at Rs 39,815 crore, missing estimates of Rs 40,304 crore.  According to analysts at Noumra, despite soft NIM and significant one-off expenses in Q3FY24, SBI demonstrated robust loan growth, although NIM fell short of expectations.  &quot;The bank is positioned well within the current tight liquidity environment,&quot; it said, adding that SBI's operational expenses were managed effectively, excluding the impact of elevated provisions for wage revisions.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live action  While the brokerage has put a 'buy' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 755 per share, it has adjusted its FY24 EPS estimate downward by 13 percent.  SBI's\\xa0asset quality remained robust in the quarter under review, with net slippage at just 0.4 percent.  JP Morgan noted that despite a 12-bps sequential decrease in core NIMs due to deposit repricing, SBI's credit costs were lower, with core loan losses offset against account level upgrades.  Looking ahead, the brokerage believes that Q4 is expected to see another wage revision hike, while FY25 stands to benefit from a moderation in wage costs, driving up the operating leverage. It has an 'overweight' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 725 per share.  Jefferies also has a 'buy' rating on SBI with a target price of Rs 810 per share. The public sector lender's NIMs were effectively managed, contributing to NII growth, while loan growth improved to 14 percent, primarily driven by corporate loans, the brokerage noted. The unsecured retail segment shows signs of normalisation downward, it said.  &quot;Despite concerns, asset quality is performing better than estimated. With a CET-1 ratio of 10.4 percent, there's a limited buffer, but high return on equity (RoE) and marked-to-margin (MTM) gains may provide support. However, the potential for a near-term capital raise remains an overhang,&quot; Jefferies said in a report.  Note that the CET-1 ratio compares a bank's capital against its risk-weighted assets to determine its ability to withstand financial distress.\\xa0International firm Bernstein also has an 'Outperform' rating on SBI with a target price of Rs 710 per share.  Also Read |\\xa0SBI Q3 results: Net profit plummets 35% to Rs 9,163 crore, asset quality healthy  According to Motilal Oswal, SBI has various levers such as cash deposit (CD) ratio and marginal cost of the fund-based lending rate (MCLR) repricing to keep margins stable.  SBI's business growth remains robust, with signs of a recovery in the corporate segment, the brokerage said as it maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock with an unchanged target price of Rs 800.  Analysts at JM Financial Services\\xa0believe delivery of growth on guided lines, sustenance of NIMs near current levels and controlled asset quality parameters aiding controlled credit costs should lead to strong profitability going ahead.  &quot;We value the core banking business at 1.2x FY26 P/BV and\\xa0arrive at our SoTP-based target price of Rs 800 per share,&quot; the brokerage said as it maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock.  At 9:43am, the SBI shares traded flat at Rs 651.70 a piece on the NSE. The stock has risen around 18 percent in the last one year, underperforming benchmark Nifty 50 which has risen 23 percent during this period.

      "Several brokerages, including Motilal Oswal, Jefferies and Nomura, have a “buy” call on SBI stock. JP Morgan and Bernstein have an “overweight” call on the counter.\n",
      "State Bank of India (SBI) has failed to live up to the projections made by the Street with its Q3 net profit being battered down by a hefty wage and pension bill. The state-run lender's overall earnings, however, remained healthy, driven by lower credit costs, despite weak core operating performance, which attracted bullish calls from brokerages. Analysts believe that SBI is well-placed amid tight liquidity.  For the quarter ended December 2023, the bank's net profit fell 35 percent on-year to Rs 9,163 crore under Rs 7,100-crore pension liabilities. The net interest income (NII) of the country's largest bank came in at Rs 39,815 crore, missing estimates of Rs 40,304 crore.  According to analysts at Noumra, despite soft NIM and significant one-off expenses in Q3FY24, SBI demonstrated robust loan growth, although NIM fell short of expectations.  &quot;The bank is positioned well within the current tight liquidity environment,&quot; it said, adding that SBI's operational expenses were managed effectively, excluding the impact of elevated provisions for wage revisions.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live action  While the brokerage has put a 'buy' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 755 per share, it has adjusted its FY24 EPS estimate downward by 13 percent.  SBI's asset quality remained robust in the quarter under review, with net slippage at just 0.4 percent.  JP Morgan noted that despite a 12-bps sequential decrease in core NIMs due to deposit repricing, SBI's credit costs were lower, with core loan losses offset against account level upgrades.  Looking ahead, the brokerage believes that Q4 is expected to see another wage revision hike, while FY25 stands to benefit from a moderation in wage costs, driving up the operating leverage. It has an 'overweight' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 725 per share.  Jefferies also has a 'buy' rating on SBI with a target price of Rs 810 per share. The public sector lender's NIMs were effectively managed, contributing to NII growth, while loan growth improved to 14 percent, primarily driven by corporate loans, the brokerage noted. The unsecured retail segment shows signs of normalisation downward, it said.  &quot;Despite concerns, asset quality is performing better than estimated. With a CET-1 ratio of 10.4 percent, there's a limited buffer, but high return on equity (RoE) and marked-to-margin (MTM) gains may provide support. However, the potential for a near-term capital raise remains an overhang,&quot; Jefferies said in a report.  Note that the CET-1 ratio compares a bank's capital against its risk-weighted assets to determine its ability to withstand financial distress. International firm Bernstein also has an 'Outperform' rating on SBI with a target price of Rs 710 per share.  Also Read | SBI Q3 results: Net profit plummets 35% to Rs 9,163 crore, asset quality healthy  According to Motilal Oswal, SBI has various levers such as cash deposit (CD) ratio and marginal cost of the fund-based lending rate (MCLR) repricing to keep margins stable.  SBI's business growth remains robust, with signs of a recovery in the corporate segment, the brokerage said as it maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock with an unchanged target price of Rs 800.  Analysts at JM Financial Services believe delivery of growth on guided lines, sustenance of NIMs near current levels and controlled asset quality parameters aiding controlled credit costs should lead to strong profitability going ahead.  &quot;We value the core banking business at 1.2x FY26 P/BV and arrive at our SoTP-based target price of Rs 800 per share,&quot; the brokerage said as it maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock.  At 9:43am, the SBI shares traded flat at Rs 651.70 a piece on the NSE. The stock has risen around 18 percent in the last one year, underperforming benchmark Nifty 50 which has risen 23 percent during this period.

We will have to change our Virtual Payment Address (VPA) as we partner with other banks. The decision to change partner banks will happen in a few weeks. We are in discussion and these are yet to be completed,” Sharma said.  RBI on January 31 imposed major business restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank including accepting fresh deposits and doing credit transactions after February 29. On March 11, the RBI barred Paytm Payments Bank from onboarding new customers.  The central bank said a Comprehensive System Audit report and subsequent compliance validation report of the external auditors revealed persistent non-compliances and continued material supervisory concerns in the bank, warranting further supervisory action.  No further deposits or credit transactions or top ups shall be allowed in any customer accounts, prepaid instruments, wallets, FASTags, NCMC cards, etc. after February 29, 2024, other than any interest, cashbacks, or refunds which may be credited anytime, RBI said.  The central bank also asked to terminate the Nodal Accounts of One97 Communications Ltd and Paytm Payments Services Ltd. at the earliest, in any case not later than February 29, 2024.  The RBI directed the payments bank to settle all pipeline transaction and nodal accounts by March 15 and no further transaction shall be permitted thereafter.\n",

Moneycontrol has accessed and reviewed an internal letter issued by the bank to this effect, dated January 12.  The decision is in view of issues being raised on mis-selling. “To ensure doing insurance and wealth business as per proper product suitability and matching with customers requirements while also taking and recording of customer consent at all stages of the sales process, it has been decided to not run any wealth business in a campaign mode,” said the letter to zonal heads.  BoB is the third bank to issue orders cracking down on misselling.  Earlier, on January 2, State Bank of India (SBI) and Chennai-based Indian bank had instructed senior employees across circles not to conduct any business conclaves, seminars, or felicitation functions till March 31.  &quot;Any deviation in this regard will require prior approval of the undersigned,&quot; said an internal circular from SBI, dated December 28, that Moneycontrol has reviewed.  &quot;It is to be ensured that any recognition/felicitation for the qualifier in campaigns of CVEBU (customer value enhancement business unit) will be subject to achievement of certain core business parameters, specified which will be advised in due course,&quot; said the circular, signed by Vinay Tonse, managing director of retail business and operations, SBI.  BOB's internal letter added that all existing campaigns announced earlier, as per the annual calendar of campaigns, including the PRIDE 6.0 campaigns, stand withdrawn for the current quarter.  &quot;It is further advised that all zones and field units should not conduct any business conclaves, seminars or reward and recognition programs/ facilitation program during this quarter and until further instructions,&quot; the letter stated.  &quot;It is also directed by our top management that no campaigns including any local training programs/reward programs etc, with any of our channel partners shall also be conducted till March 31, 2024, &quot; it added.  An email sent to the bank seeking a response remained unanswered at the time of publishing.  Alarming rise in complaints  Earlier, in a communication to all public sector banks, the Department of Financial Services (DFS) had said there was an alarming increase in the number of complaints arising from customers being forced to buy insurance products.  The DFS letter to heads of public sector banks said that it had received complaints that fraudulent and unethical practices are adopted by banks and life insurance companies to sell policies to bank customers. There have allegedly been instances where life insurance policies were sold to customers aged above 75 years in tier-II and III cities.  Usually, branches of banks push the products of their subsidiary insurers. When resisted by customers, branch officials would sheepishly admit that they were under pressure from the top. Insurance products are flogged when customers go to banks to seek a loan or make a term deposit.  In this regard, the DFS letter had said, the department has already issued a circular stating that a bank should not force customers to get insurance from a particular company.  Orders from above  Last year, several bankers told Moneycontrol\\xa0, on condition of anonymity, that they were facing immense pressure from the top management to sell third-party products such as insurance. Failure to meet targets invited informal penal actions while meeting targets brought perks such as parties in five-star resorts.  Banks typically cross-sell the insurance products of their subsidiaries, and sometimes of other companies, along with loan products. Often, banks insist on the purchase of policies along with loan products.  “We are forced to sell insurance products. Despite the fact that we are bankers, we have become agents of insurance companies,” lamented a manager-level employee of Bank of Baroda, on condition of anonymity. “In the last 1-2 years, core banking work has been disturbed badly as our workforce was involved more in selling insurance products,” said the official.  CH Venkatachalam, General Secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), said insurance companies typically offer gifts to bank managers for selling their products.  “Insurance companies also treat some of the bank managers who canvas more insurance products.

      "Exclusive: After SBI and Indian Bank, BOB cracks down on misselling of insurance, mutual fund products\n",
      "The bank has asked its zonal heads to not conduct any further campaigns in view of complaints about mis-selling.  \n",
      "Public sector lender Bank of Baroda (BOB) has asked its zonal heads to not conduct any wealth business campaigns related to selling life, general and health insurance policies or mutual funds till March 31.  Moneycontrol has accessed and reviewed an internal letter issued by the bank to this effect, dated January 12.  The decision is in view of issues being raised on mis-selling. “To ensure doing insurance and wealth business as per proper product suitability and matching with customers requirements while also taking and recording of customer consent at all stages of the sales process, it has been decided to not run any wealth business in a campaign mode,” said the letter to zonal heads.  BoB is the third bank to issue orders cracking down on misselling.  Earlier, on January 2, State Bank of India (SBI) and Chennai-based Indian bank had instructed senior employees across circles not to conduct any business conclaves, seminars, or felicitation functions till March 31.  &quot;Any deviation in this regard will require prior approval of the undersigned,&quot; said an internal circular from SBI, dated December 28, that Moneycontrol has reviewed.  &quot;It is to be ensured that any recognition/felicitation for the qualifier in campaigns of CVEBU (customer value enhancement business unit) will be subject to achievement of certain core business parameters, specified which will be advised in due course,&quot; said the circular, signed by Vinay Tonse, managing director of retail business and operations, SBI.  BOB's internal letter added that all existing campaigns announced earlier, as per the annual calendar of campaigns, including the PRIDE 6.0 campaigns, stand withdrawn for the current quarter.  &quot;It is further advised that all zones and field units should not conduct any business conclaves, seminars or reward and recognition programs/ facilitation program during this quarter and until further instructions,&quot; the letter stated.  &quot;It is also directed by our top management that no campaigns including any local training programs/reward programs etc, with any of our channel partners shall also be conducted till March 31, 2024, &quot; it added.  An email sent to the bank seeking a response remained unanswered at the time of publishing.  Alarming rise in complaints  Earlier, in a communication to all public sector banks, the Department of Financial Services (DFS) had said there was an alarming increase in the number of complaints arising from customers being forced to buy insurance products.  The DFS letter to heads of public sector banks said that it had received complaints that fraudulent and unethical practices are adopted by banks and life insurance companies to sell policies to bank customers. There have allegedly been instances where life insurance policies were sold to customers aged above 75 years in tier-II and III cities.  Usually, branches of banks push the products of their subsidiary insurers. When resisted by customers, branch officials would sheepishly admit that they were under pressure from the top. Insurance products are flogged when customers go to banks to seek a loan or make a term deposit.  In this regard, the DFS letter had said, the department has already issued a circular stating that a bank should not force customers to get insurance from a particular company.  Orders from above  Last year, several bankers told Moneycontrol , on condition of anonymity, that they were facing immense pressure from the top management to sell third-party products such as insurance. Failure to meet targets invited informal penal actions while meeting targets brought perks such as parties in five-star resorts.  Banks typically cross-sell the insurance products of their subsidiaries, and sometimes of other companies, along with loan products. Often, banks insist on the purchase of policies along with loan products.  “We are forced to sell insurance products. Despite the fact that we are bankers, we have become agents of insurance companies,” lamented a manager-level employee of Bank of Baroda, on condition of anonymity. “In the last 1-2 years, core banking work has been disturbed badly as our workforce was involved more in selling insurance products,” said the official.

The stock hit a high of Rs\\xa091.81 with its market cap hitting over Rs 1.01 lakh crore. At 9.30am, the stock was trading at Rs 90.8 a share, up 1 percent from its previous close. Earlier, State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda had crossed this milestone.  The PNB stock surged due to a sustained rally in various public sector firms. Analysts note that PSU banks are undervalued in comparison to private banks. Banks have bolstered their balance sheets and enhanced asset quality, notably through low slippage ratios and reduced credit costs in public sector banks.  The lender reported 327 percent rise in net profit at Rs 1,756 crore for the July–September quarter of the current financial year. The public-sector lender's gross non-performing assets (GNPA) declined to 6.96 percent from 10.48 percent in this period and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) fell to 1.47 percent from 3.80 percent.  Quarterly credit cost stands at 1.68\\xa0percent (-46bps QoQ)\\xa0and the management aims to cut it down to 1.5-1.75\\xa0percent in\\xa0FY24 by enforcing stricter underwriting on new loans and enhancing collection efficiency. PNB's improving growth and recoveries from older stressed assets contribute to better return metrics, fostering lower credit costs for new lending. These factors are expected to sustain earnings momentum, analysts said.  &quot;We believe the bank is likely to deliver higher growth as balance sheet strength improves further going ahead. Healthy loan growth, stable margins and lower opex growth is expected to lead strong PPoP growth. Overall, asset quality outlook remains stable to positive. Lower slippage formation and healthy recoveries are likely to boost the asset quality further and will help in faster normalisation of credit costs. Healthy PPoP growth and normalisation of credit costs should drive a strong improvement in return ratios in FY25. We expect RoA/RoE to be at 0.9/12\\xa0percent in FY25,&quot; Sharekhan said in its recent note.  In a recent interview with CNBC-TV18, Sridhar Sivaram from Enam Holdings notes that despite recent gains, PSU stocks remain undervalued. He highlights significant positive changes in the business models of government-owned companies.  PSUs have outperformed, showing a 50\\xa0percent CAGR in the last three years. Some PSU banks, despite stock price quadrupling, still trade at low P/E ratios of 5 to 6. Sivaram suggests these stocks could double and still be reasonably priced.  The BSE PSU index surged 43\\xa0percent this year and holds a P/E ratio of 9.12. Improved governance and business models have reduced government pressure for profit focus in these firms. Sivaram finds the entire PSU sector promising, except for a few, and worthy of attention.

The stock hit a high of Rs 91.81 with its market cap hitting over Rs 1.01 lakh crore. At 9.30am, the stock was trading at Rs 90.8 a share, up 1 percent from its previous close. Earlier, State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda had crossed this milestone.  The PNB stock surged due to a sustained rally in various public sector firms. Analysts note that PSU banks are undervalued in comparison to private banks. Banks have bolstered their balance sheets and enhanced asset quality, notably through low slippage ratios and reduced credit costs in public sector banks.  The lender reported 327 percent rise in net profit at Rs 1,756 crore for the July–September quarter of the current financial year. The public-sector lender's gross non-performing assets (GNPA) declined to 6.96 percent from 10.48 percent in this period and the net non-performing assets (NNPA) fell to 1.47 percent from 3.80 percent.  Quarterly credit cost stands at 1.68 percent (-46bps QoQ) and the management aims to cut it down to 1.5-1.75 percent in FY24 by enforcing stricter underwriting on new loans and enhancing collection efficiency. PNB's improving growth and recoveries from older stressed assets contribute to better return metrics, fostering lower credit costs for new lending. These factors are expected to sustain earnings momentum, analysts said.  &quot;We believe the bank is likely to deliver higher growth as balance sheet strength improves further going ahead. Healthy loan growth, stable margins and lower opex growth is expected to lead strong PPoP growth. Overall, asset quality outlook remains stable to positive. Lower slippage formation and healthy recoveries are likely to boost the asset quality further and will help in faster normalisation of credit costs. Healthy PPoP growth and normalisation of credit costs should drive a strong improvement in return ratios in FY25. We expect RoA/RoE to be at 0.9/12 percent in FY25,&quot; Sharekhan said in its recent note.  In a recent interview with CNBC-TV18, Sridhar Sivaram from Enam Holdings notes that despite recent gains, PSU stocks remain undervalued. He highlights significant positive changes in the business models of government-owned companies.  PSUs have outperformed, showing a 50 percent CAGR in the last three years. Some PSU banks, despite stock price quadrupling, still trade at low P/E ratios of 5 to 6. Sivaram suggests these stocks could double and still be reasonably priced.  The BSE PSU index surged 43 percent this year and holds a P/E ratio of 9.12. Improved governance and business models have reduced government pressure for profit focus in these firms. Sivaram finds the entire PSU sector promising, except for a few, and worthy of attention.

Despite objections and arguments in favour of preserving state-owned banks to strengthen welfarism by stakeholders and trade unions, it will happen, they say.  The finance minister had announced the government’s intent to privatise two public-sector banks in the 2021 Union Budget as part of the new public sector enterprise (PSE) policy that restricted the number of players in the public sector to a maximum of four in strategic areas. The banking, Insurance and Financial Services, a strategic sector currently has 12 public lenders and about five insurers.  “I think the big step was the new PSU policy. That policy is now approved and it is in place and I don’t think anyone is going to change it. My experience with policy reform is you take the big decision. It does not matter if implementation is delayed because there is no point in announcing a policy and being forced to reverse it. In that sense, I think privatisation of public sector banks will happen but I cannot judge at this point of time when it will happen. I would say the probability of it happening will go up after elections,” NITI Aayog member Arvind Virmani told Moneycontrol.  Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, of Mastercard and former State Bank of India Chairman agrees.  “Bank privatisation continues to be on the agenda. Many private institutions are very active in financial inclusion. I don’t think that it will be impacted if we have more private banks,” Kumar told Moneycontrol.  The first step for bank privatisation is an amendment to the Banking Acts which is yet to get a go-ahead from the Prime Minister’s Office. The change is required in the Banking Companies Acquisition Act, 1970/1980 which prescribes a minimum 51 percent share of the government.  “Unfortunately, sometimes, politics and ideology trump. But even in this case, eventually, it will happen because that is the reality. Some past experiences or templates can be used to see through the privatisation of PSBs. Air India is a good template,” he said.  Drivers of social schemes Supporters of the welfare argument feel social schemes may be impacted because public sector banks play a big role to facilitate such measures. The government has been asking these banks to increase their share in these schemes. Some examples are, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), Atal Pension Yojana (APY), Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Stand Up India Scheme, Sukanya Samridhhi Scheme, Senior Citizen Saving Scheme and the Kisan Vikas Patra.  Most of these schemes are targeted at rural areas and the fear is that these might be affected. The number of public sector banks (PSBs) has already come down from 27 to 12 due to mergers over the years.  “When it comes to the social responsibility of banks, PSBS are better placed than private sector banks. Large parts of the banking business in rural areas are done by public sector banks. There are many indicators supporting that kind of argument, one would be the Jan Dhan accounts itself, the number of branches of PSBs are more in rural areas. The reach and cost matter a lot. Strong and efficient banks are important, be it public or private, but when it comes to rural areas, PSBs are better placed to do business,” economist N R Bhanumurthy told Moneycontrol.  Another rationale behind the government’s intent to privatise PSBs is to bring in competition in the overall banking sector while ensuring the growth of the sector. But the number of times the central bank has fined private sector banks of late suggests that private sector banks are not necessarily more efficient compared to state-owned banks, Bhanumurthy adds.  Opposition of Bank Unions  The bank unions see PSBs as nation-building institutions that utilise public savings for priority sectors like agriculture and have been going on strike from time to time to oppose it. In 2021, eight lakh bank employees went on strike against privatisation.  “Banks have huge resources in the form of deposits of the people. PSBs are able to deploy these resources on a priority basis in agriculture, employment generation, poverty reduction, infrastructure, rural development and education. If banks are privatised, everything will become commercial. Public sector banks are the golden goose. It is unwise to kill them. People’s money should be utilised for welfare and not for private profiteering. Public Sector Banks are nation-building institutions. The privatisation of banks is unwise in India. YES Bank is private, but it collapsed,” All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) General Secretary C H Venkatachalam told Moneycontrol.  “The government is aware of our stiff opposition and hence they are going slow or maybe they have other priorities now. Anyway, they have not moved further in the matter so far. But I don’t believe that they have abandoned the decision. The agenda is still alive,” he added.  The bank unions are determined to continue the stiff resistance against privatisation, which may have been a factor behind the government's reluctance to move ahead with this Budget announcement.  “Privatisation of public sector banks is certainly not in the right direction. Our nation has got more than six lakh villages and every village having a population of 2,500 should have one brick and mortar model of a public sector bank branch. Any attempt to privatise the existing public sector banks would be resisted by the bank unions,” All India Bank Officers' Association (AIBOA) General Secretary Nagarajan S told Moneycontrol.  Given the heated debate over privatising PSBs, Bhanumurthy says there is a need to take the middle path.  “We have vast experience of merger and acquisitions between public and private banks. I don’t think there is a singular conclusion on the question of whether public banks should be privatised,” he said.\", 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/adrija-chatterjee-29491/', 'name': 'Adrija Chatterjee'}, 'publisher': {'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Moneycontrol', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.moneycontrol.com/mcnews/images/eng-left-mc-logo-600x60.png', 'width': '600', 'height': '60'}}, 'associatedMedia': {'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2017/11/SBI.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1600&height=900', 'caption': 'Debate over bank privatisation rages on, but experts say it is inevitable', 'height': '900', 'width': '1600'}}\n",

The memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed last week between the IBA, United Forum of Banks, and other unions as part of the 12th bipartite settlement.  The annual increase in salary and allowances will be at 17 percent of the annual pay slip expenses for FY22. This would amount to about Rs 12,449 crore for all public sector banks, including State Bank of India (SBI).  Also Read:\\xa0IBA signs MOU with bank employee unions on wage revision  For context, PSU banks reported a healthy 57 per cent rise in net profit to around Rs 1 lakh crore in FY2023.  On the employees’ expenses side, the total wage bill of SBI alone stood at Rs 57,292 crore in FY23.  While the quantum of hike was higher than that in the previous wage hike cycle (15 percent), most banks have already been providing for the revised wages, assuming a hike of 14-15 percent, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said.  As a result of the agreement, banks will be required to make one-time provisions for arrears of wages for the past 11 months (November 2022 to September 2023) and arrears of retirement benefits (pension and gratuity).  “In our estimate, the impact of wage arrears is unlikely to be material,” Kotak added.  Based on its preliminary estimates, the one-time provision for wage arrears adds to the overall cost (FY24) for banks by 0-2 percent.  Consequently, it will have an impact of 0-3 percent on FY24 earnings per share (EPS) for banks under its coverage.    “While the impact of higher retirement benefits is difficult to quantify, it is unlikely to be material either. Thus, this additional cost will be absorbed by banks without a noticeable dent in profitability,” the domestic brokerage added.  The banks under its coverage include SBI, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India, Federal Bank and Karur Vysya Bank.  Growth Drivers  According to analysts, state-run lenders’ robust credit growth and improving profitability allow them to absorb the wage hike without breaking much sweat.  The key monitorable for the sector is the pressure on the margins front, and not incremental employee costs, which anyways was largely factored in.  “The pressures on margins will continue going into H2 FY24, with cost of funds yet to peak. Most banks are likely to exit FY24 with net interest margins (NIMs) broadly similar to or marginally lower than FY23,” Axis Securities said.

      "Wage Hike: How will it impact PSU banks?\n",
      "State-run lenders’ robust credit growth and improving profitability allow them to absorb the wage hike impact without breaking much sweat, analysts said.\n",
      "The Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) and other bank unions have agreed to a 17 percent hike for staffers for five years starting fiscal 2021-22, but this will have a negligible impact on PSU banks’ profitability or return ratios, analysts said.  The memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed last week between the IBA, United Forum of Banks, and other unions as part of the 12th bipartite settlement.  The annual increase in salary and allowances will be at 17 percent of the annual pay slip expenses for FY22. This would amount to about Rs 12,449 crore for all public sector banks, including State Bank of India (SBI).  Also Read: IBA signs MOU with bank employee unions on wage revision  For context, PSU banks reported a healthy 57 per cent rise in net profit to around Rs 1 lakh crore in FY2023.  On the employees’ expenses side, the total wage bill of SBI alone stood at Rs 57,292 crore in FY23.  While the quantum of hike was higher than that in the previous wage hike cycle (15 percent), most banks have already been providing for the revised wages, assuming a hike of 14-15 percent, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said.  As a result of the agreement, banks will be required to make one-time provisions for arrears of wages for the past 11 months (November 2022 to September 2023) and arrears of retirement benefits (pension and gratuity).  “In our estimate, the impact of wage arrears is unlikely to be material,” Kotak added.  Based on its preliminary estimates, the one-time provision for wage arrears adds to the overall cost (FY24) for banks by 0-2 percent.  Consequently, it will have an impact of 0-3 percent on FY24 earnings per share (EPS) for banks under its coverage.    “While the impact of higher retirement benefits is difficult to quantify, it is unlikely to be material either. Thus, this additional cost will be absorbed by banks without a noticeable dent in profitability,” the domestic brokerage added.  The banks under its coverage include SBI, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India, Federal Bank and Karur Vysya Bank.  Growth Drivers  According to analysts, state-run lenders’ robust credit growth and improving profitability allow them to absorb the wage hike without breaking much sweat.  The key monitorable for the sector is the pressure on the margins front, and not incremental employee costs, which anyways was largely factored in.  “The pressures on margins will continue going into H2 FY24, with cost of funds yet to peak. Most banks are likely to exit FY24 with net interest margins (NIMs) broadly similar to or marginally lower than FY23,” Axis Securities said.

There’s no surprise when it comes to banking, and to the biggest private lender in the company. It is estimated that there is high growth potential in the lender on account of good capital position, revenue and cost synergies arising out of the HDFC merger, which will aid growth and profitability.   Given its stature as the largest public sector lender, the stock seems to be a safe investment. Analysts say the bank is well-capitalised to handle any additional risk on its portfolio due to uncertainty. SBI's asset quality has also steadily improved over the years.   The IT sector has been one of the worst-hit in recent months as people returned to offices and students to classrooms, putting a stop to COVID-led gains. Rising interest\\xa0rates are a worry and\\xa0Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been another dampener. This is because recessionary fears and a possible economic crisis have forced companies to lower tech spending. The company boasts of a large retail investor base and remains among a few IT companies on analysts' favoured list.   In a span of six months, the share price has gained 323 percent following the company’s increased push towards sustainable energy and the government's emphasis on renewable sources. Since the start of 2023, the company has won multiple projects. These factors together make it an attractive buy for investors.   The IT major, like other companies in the sector, has been on the receiving end of the post-COVID slowdown and the Russian-Ukraine war. Deal wins coupled with the resilience observed in the first half of FY24 are expected to provide support, and mitigate the potential downside impact on the full-year FY24 figures.   The Tata group is one of India's oldest conglomerates and arguably among the very few to have consistently retained shareholder confidence across businesses. Much of this confidence is attributed to the company's prudent cash flow management, efficient capital allocation strategies, healthy business partnerships and the ability to execute strategic manoeuvres.   The railway company has been on the up ever since regular travel resumed after the pandemic. Extensive connectivity plans by the government have also added to the momentum, leading investors to buy the stock.

It is estimated that there is high growth potential in the lender on account of good capital position, revenue and cost synergies arising out of the HDFC merger, which will aid growth and profitability.   Given its stature as the largest public sector lender, the stock seems to be a safe investment. Analysts say the bank is well-capitalised to handle any additional risk on its portfolio due to uncertainty. SBI's asset quality has also steadily improved over the years.   The IT sector has been one of the worst-hit in recent months as people returned to offices and students to classrooms, putting a stop to COVID-led gains. Rising interest rates are a worry and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been another dampener. This is because recessionary fears and a possible economic crisis have forced companies to lower tech spending. The company boasts of a large retail investor base and remains among a few IT companies on analysts' favoured list.   In a span of six months, the share price has gained 323 percent following the company’s increased push towards sustainable energy and the government's emphasis on renewable sources. Since the start of 2023, the company has won multiple projects. These factors together make it an attractive buy for investors.   The IT major, like other companies in the sector, has been on the receiving end of the post-COVID slowdown and the Russian-Ukraine war. Deal wins coupled with the resilience observed in the first half of FY24 are expected to provide support, and mitigate the potential downside impact on the full-year FY24 figures.   The Tata group is one of India's oldest conglomerates and arguably among the very few to have consistently retained shareholder confidence across businesses. Much of this confidence is attributed to the company's prudent cash flow management, efficient capital allocation strategies, healthy business partnerships and the ability to execute strategic manoeuvres.   The railway company has been on the up ever since regular travel resumed after the pandemic. Extensive connectivity plans by the government have also added to the momentum, leading investors to buy the stock.

Sharma commented that the big banks are at a size where they need to take more risks to grow. “The Non-Performing Asset (NPA) number of HDFC Bank came out a while ago and we know what kind of reaction that elicited,” Sharma added.  HDFC Bank in its Q2 results, saw its GNPA/NNPA ratios increase marginally to 1.3 percent/0.4 percent due to its merger with HDFC.  Sharma pointed out that banks don’t want to lend to corporates making retail segments, the prime target. “Nobody wants to lend to the corporates. None of the private sector banks are interested in that. Everyone is chasing the retail loan segment. In that, the bankable retail loan is probably done and dusted. So you need to go to unbankable or moderately bankable which is the unsecured part and this has become a larger pie of incremental bank lending.”  Watch the full interview here  Unsecured loans refer to credit cards, personal and microfinance loans. UBS Group had recently flagged the increasing risks in retail unsecured loans for banks. UBS analysts said that unsecured retail loans increase default risk for banks by 50-200 bps. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently raised concerns about a surge in unsecured credit growth and asked banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFC) to enhance their internal surveillance mechanisms.  Sharma said this risk-taking approach makes him uncomfortable as blowups have happened across banks worldwide due to unsecured lending. “We will be no exception. Mark my words. In 2 or 3 years, these same loans will come back to haunt these banks. I will be then around hopefully to pick these banks when the trade is closer to book value,” Sharma added.

      "Banks going into unbankable segments with unsecured credit will blow up: Shankar Sharma\n",
      "Veteran investor Shankar Sharma said this risk-taking approach makes him uncomfortable as blowups have happened across banks worldwide due to unsecured lending.\n",
      "Banks are at risk of blowing up in 2-3 years as they chase unsecured credit from unbankable segments, says veteran investor Shankar Sharma. Sharma commented that the big banks are at a size where they need to take more risks to grow. “The Non-Performing Asset (NPA) number of HDFC Bank came out a while ago and we know what kind of reaction that elicited,” Sharma added.  HDFC Bank in its Q2 results, saw its GNPA/NNPA ratios increase marginally to 1.3 percent/0.4 percent due to its merger with HDFC.  Sharma pointed out that banks don’t want to lend to corporates making retail segments, the prime target. “Nobody wants to lend to the corporates. None of the private sector banks are interested in that. Everyone is chasing the retail loan segment. In that, the bankable retail loan is probably done and dusted. So you need to go to unbankable or moderately bankable which is the unsecured part and this has become a larger pie of incremental bank lending.”  Watch the full interview here  Unsecured loans refer to credit cards, personal and microfinance loans. UBS Group had recently flagged the increasing risks in retail unsecured loans for banks. UBS analysts said that unsecured retail loans increase default risk for banks by 50-200 bps. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently raised concerns about a surge in unsecured credit growth and asked banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFC) to enhance their internal surveillance mechanisms.  Sharma said this risk-taking approach makes him uncomfortable as blowups have happened across banks worldwide due to unsecured lending. “We will be no exception. Mark my words. In 2 or 3 years, these same loans will come back to haunt these banks. I will be then around hopefully to pick these banks when the trade is closer to book value,” Sharma added.

This growth is primarily attributed to the anticipated 10 percent increase in average revenue per user (ARPU) from Jio and the notable momentum in the retail business. Reliance Industries' commitment to maintaining a net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ratio below 1x provides further confidence to investors. The company's expansion in the petrochemicals sector enhances its potential for generating free cash flow, it says. Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group. Network18 is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary.   State Bank of India: The analyst report sees a 17.66 percent upside with a target price of Rs 665 for the State Bank of India stock due to its stable core fundamentals, strong CASA franchise, and digital banking platform, making it an attractive investment. Despite concerns about uneven monsoons and inflation, the bank's positive macroeconomic situation and stable financial backdrop aid the sentiment. Strong traction in retail and SME segments, a focus on overseas loan growth, and the resolution of management change uncertainty indicate growth opportunities and reduced overhang on the stock.   Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro: JM Financial Services has set a target price of Rs 3,430, up 17.21 percent from the CMP for L&amp;amp;T due to its position as India's largest EPC company, benefiting from government-funded infrastructure projects and strong order inflow from the Middle East. The positive earnings outlook is driven by strong order intake, improved execution, and reduced asset intensity, with a projected 27 percent EPS CAGR in the project management business for FY23-25 years. L&amp;amp;T's measures and a 19 percent YoY order inflow growth in FY23 enhance its investment appeal.   Hindustan Aeronautics: Analysts have predicted a 21.55 percent upside in the CMP of Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) to a target price of Rs 2,230. The company is a dominant player in India's defence aerospace sector, which is leveraging its monopoly and the government's Make in India initiative. As the primary supplier of India's military aircraft, HAL has a significant advantage in the defence sector. Its strong technological capabilities, including advanced platforms like Tejas and Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft, contribute to its positive outlook. HAL's strong order book and pipeline of over Rs 2 trillion provide good earnings visibility, leaving it well-positioned to tap growth through its focus on R&amp;amp;D and recent pacts with GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines. HAL is also expanding internationally with its indigenous range of light combat aircraft. JMFS also pointed to risks such as stiff competition, order execution delays and slower fresh order intake.   Sun Pharmaceuticals: JM Financial Services has set a target price of Rs 1,300 for Sun Pharmaceuticals, reflecting a 16.57 percent increase from the current market price (CMP). The leading pharmaceutical company Sun is seeing significant growth in its specialty business owing to the success of important drugs including Levulan, Ilumya, and Cequa. Its strong outlook is supported by the company's strengthening balance sheet and capacity to maintain margins over 27 percent despite higher R&amp;amp;D expenses. Its worldwide specialist business is expected to contribute to total profitability by reaching $1 billion in FY24. JMFS' expectation that Deuruxolitinib will be filed in CY23 also contributes to the positive outlook. As the effects of sitagliptin's patent expiration in the base and NLEM normalise, Sun Pharmaceuticals expects the domestic market to rise by early double digits. Potential risks include shifts in the regulatory environment, possible erosion of prices, or any delays in launching of important new products.   Ashok Leyland: Ashok Leyland is expected to reach a price target of Rs 200, up 19.08 percent from its current market price, as per the JMFS report. The company is poised for substantial expansion in the domestic commercial vehicle (CV) sector based on favorable macroeconomic conditions and increased government expenditure on infrastructure. The company's strategic focus on augmenting its market share in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) segment, particularly in the northern and eastern markets, will be executed through the expansion of its network and addressing product gaps. With the anticipated increase in demand momentum and a robust MHCV demand projection for FY24, Ashok Leyland is projected to grow at the rate of 8-10 percent YoY, driven by government investments in infrastructure and strong replacement demand. The positive feedback received for the company's AVTR range of trucks along with its dedication towards cost-cutting measures, lower commodity prices and more operating leverage further augment its growth potential. Ashok Leyland is well-positioned to benefit from the expanding market as the current CV upcycle, supported by an expanding economy, continues into FY24 while maintaining its long-term goal of reaching a 35 percent market share in the MHCV space.   SJVN: One of the largest hydropower utilities of India, SJVN is expected to reach a target price of Rs 80, 14.86 percent higher than CMP. The company’s total generation is set to grow by 3x in FY26 owing to an installed hydro capacity of 1,912MW and underconstruction projects of 7,519MW (hydro, renewables &amp;amp; thermal power). The company is expanding its renewables portfolio, aiming to add 1.0-1.5GW capacity annually and it also registered a subsidiary, SJVN Green Energy Limited, in March 2022. Analysts are bullish on the stock as it aims to achieve 19GW of solar capacity by 2040, making up 39 percent of its total installed capacity. SJVN has signed a MoU with the Maharashtra government for 5,000MW renewable energy projects and has also secured several other renewable energy projects under TBCB.   Coforge: JM Financial Services has set a target price of Rs 5,920 for the stock, an 18.67 percent upside from the current market price of Rs 4,988.65. The company is strategically positioned to achieve substantial growth, with plans to double its annual revenue run-rate within the next five years. Coforge's focus on risk and compliance, card and payments in the BFS sector has led to significant success, as evidenced by its deal wins against larger industry players. The company has displayed consistent EOB growth and successful smaller deal wins, thus delivering profitable growth. Despite an anticipated seasonal dip in Q3, JMFS expects Coforge to witness rebound growth in Q4. While FY24E cc revenue growth has been moderated to 13.5 percent with FY24-25E EPS adjustments being made, Coforge maintains impressive earnings visibility, with a projected 24 percent EPS CAGR over FY23-26E. The report lists changed regulatory landscape, a sharp demand slowdown, and adverse forex fluctuations as potential risks.   Go Fashion India: JMFS sees a 23.24 percent upside in the Go Fashion (India) stock with a target price of Rs 1,540 due to its remarkable growth and durability making the company a leading player in the competitive bottom-wear market. Go Fashion's market domination comes as its revenue trajectory continuously exceeds that of its competitors. Analsyts believe that the company is well-positioned to increase gross margins owing to its improved product mix and stable raw material environment. In order to expedite store expansion starting in FY25, the company's business development initiatives are in progress, surpassing the present projection of 120 stores per year.   Sapphire Foods India: Analysts have predicted a target price of Rs 1560, up 21.54 percent from the CMP, for the Sapphire Foods India stock, which operates in the two subsegments- KFC and Pizza Hut in Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) space. The QSR industry is expanding in India and is expected to gain from favourable demographic factors and under-penetration of certain categories, which could eventually lead to a significant increase in the frequency of eat-out and order-in habits. Owing to the company's impressive execution, especially with the KFC subsegment, JMFS remains confident about a 5 to 7 percent same-store sales growth from the medium-term perspective while also banking on strong brand equity and edge over the competition.   Stylam Industries: Stylam Industrie is expected to reach a target price of Rs 2,070, up 21.55 percent from its current market price as epr the JMFS report. Due to its creative integration of high-value, value-added products, like high-gloss laminates with anti-fingerprint properties, which accounted for about 6 percent of its revenue in FY23, the company has become a standout in the decorative laminate market. Stylam has demonstrated a robust performance in gaining market share in both domestic and export markets, as seen in its revenue, EBITDA and PAT CAGRs of 23 percent, 26 percent and 37 percent, respectively, over the past five years. This comes against the background of a booming decorative laminate market, which is expected to reach $71 billion by 2030 from $45.55 billion in 2022. Analysts at JM Financials find Stylam Industries to be an attractive stock option due to its compelling mix of innovation, market expansion, and a favorable industry environment.\", 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/navisha-joshi-32221/', 'name': 'Navisha Joshi'}, 'publisher': {'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Moneycontrol', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.moneycontrol.com/mcnews/images/eng-left-mc-logo-600x60.png', 'width': '600', 'height': '60'}}, 'associatedMedia': {'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2023/11/Diwali-Stock-Market.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1600&height=900', 'caption': 'Diwali bluechip shopping list: RIL, SBI, L&amp;T among JM Financial’s picks for up to 21% gains', 'height': '900', 'width': '1600'}}\n",

SBI's net interest income is likely to fall 8 percent on-year to Rs 38,020 crore in the second quarter as net interest margins (NIM) contract and the cost of deposits catch up, according to the average estimate of seven brokerages.

Sequentially, profit may fall 15 percent on the back of lower treasury gains and an uptick in provisions due to a low base in the first quarter and prudential provisioning.  Provisions refer to funds set aside to cover potential losses or expenses likely to be incurred in the future. Treasury gains for a bank typically refer to income generated through treasury or investment activities. Increased investment is expected to result in higher operating expenses.  PPOP seen declining  SBI's pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) is expected to decline 19 percent YoY to Rs 20,244 crore due to higher operating expenses and lower treasury income. PPOP represents profit before accounting for provisions for loan losses and other non-operating items.  According to analysts, despite some pressure, NIMs are expected to remain largely stable, given the structure of the loan book and the negligible need for deposits to fund this growth. SBI's provisions, however, will be higher sequentially.    Recoveries to be positive  Analysts at Kotak Securities expect slippages to represent approximately 1.5 percent of loans in this quarter, with a reduced impact from priority sector lending compared to the previous quarter. However, recoveries and upgrades are likely to be good in the September quarter.  The brokerage said credit costs may rise marginally as the portfolio starts to normalise.

      "State Bank of India is likely to report a subdued quarter when it announces its earnings on November 4, with analysts expecting net interest income (NII) to fall on-year on account of pressure on net interest margins. The public sector lender's profit after tax, however, is expected to rise on-year.  While SBI's credit costs may remain stable, asset quality is expected to improve.  SBI's net interest income is likely to fall 8 percent on-year to Rs 38,020 crore in the second quarter as net interest margins (NIM) contract and the cost of deposits catch up, according to the average estimate of seven brokerages.  NIM is the difference between interest income from assets and interest expenses incurred on liabilities. It measures the effectiveness of a company’s investment decisions.

Sequentially, profit may fall 15 percent on the back of lower treasury gains and an uptick in provisions due to a low base in the first quarter and prudential provisioning.  Provisions refer to funds set aside to cover potential losses or expenses likely to be incurred in the future. Treasury gains for a bank typically refer to income generated through treasury or investment activities. Increased investment is expected to result in higher operating expenses.  PPOP seen declining  SBI's pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) is expected to decline 19 percent YoY to Rs 20,244 crore due to higher operating expenses and lower treasury income. PPOP represents profit before accounting for provisions for loan losses and other non-operating items.  According to analysts, despite some pressure, NIMs are expected to remain largely stable, given the structure of the loan book and the negligible need for deposits to fund this growth. SBI's provisions, however, will be higher sequentially.    Recoveries to be positive  Analysts at Kotak Securities expect slippages to represent approximately 1.5 percent of loans in this quarter, with a reduced impact from priority sector lending compared to the previous quarter. However, recoveries and upgrades are likely to be good in the September quarter.  The brokerage said credit costs may rise marginally as the portfolio starts to normalise.

Follow out market blog to catch all the live action  Considering relatively low CET1 versus peers, potential regulatory tightening on unsecured loans would limit loan growth or trigger dilution for SBI. The stock at one-time FY25 price to book value does not appear expensive but a likely decline in profitability may result in downside, analysts at UBS noted.

In the next three quarter, single-digit growth is expected in net interest income (NII). The brokerage sees limited upside potential in the stock.

This change in savings behaviour can have significant policy implications, particularly concerning growth and the revitalisation of investments, according to the State Bank of India’s Economic Research Department’s report, SBI Ecowrap.  “On the liability side of households, out of Rs 8.2 billion increase, Rs 7.1 billion was accounted for by increase in household borrowing from commercial banks. Juxtaposing this increase in borrowing from commercial banks with the increase in bank credit, we find that 55 percent of the retail credit to households in the last two years have gone to housing, education and vehicle purchase,” it said.  This clearly indicates that the shift from financial savings to physical savings was also triggered by a low interest rate regime in the pandemic.  “We also believe that the shift to physical assets is also triggered by a recovery in the real estate sector and the increase in property prices. The RBI House Price Index shows a modest acceleration since FY21, which may be acting as a motivator for buying homes. This increased ‘pull’ factor thereby pushing up capital spends in a multitude of sectors. If this is indeed the proximate story of the revival in household investment, this has strong policy implications for growth and investment revival,” the report mentioned.  There is a significant long run relationship between housing loans and household savings in physical assets. Every Re 1 increase in Housing loans has resulted in Rs 2.12 increase in household’s savings in physical assets for the 14 year period ended FY22.  The decline in net financial savings of households has resulted in a concomitant increase in household savings in gross physical assets. The trend is again shifting and the share of physical assets is expected to reach approximately 70 percent level in FY23, due to decline in share of financial assets. We believe that the total household savings – both financial and physical – for FY23 would still surpass the FY22 levels despite the decline in financial savings as household savings in physical assets has jumped Rs 6.5 lakh crore in FY22 over FY21 and as per current trends it is expected to jump further by up to Rs 5 lakh crore in FY23 and hence will outstrip the increase in household indebtedness,” according to the report.  The net financial saving of the household sector – the most important source of funds for the two deficit sectors, namely, the general government sector and the non-financial corporations – moderated to 5.1 percent of GDP in FY23 from 11.5 percent in FY21 and 7.6 percent from pre-pandemic year FY20.  “It has been said that it fell to a 50 year low, however this is completely misleading as household savings must be looked into as a sum total of physical and financial savings. Financial liabilities jumped Rs 8.2 trillion since pandemic, outpacing the increase in gross financial savings at Rs 6.7 lakh crore, thus explaining the fall in household net financial savings by Rs 1.5 trillion / 2.5 percent of GDP. On the asset side of households, there was an increase of Rs 4.1 lakh crore in insurance and provident and pension funds,” it said.  The shift to physical assets has an interesting policy connotation. Household sector investment gradually recovered to reach 11.8 percent in FY22. It is pertinent to note that there has been an increase in capital formation as a percentage of household gross savings to 60 percent in FY22 from a low of 47.8 percent in FY21. Thus, households have now started utilising more of their savings for capital formation. This number is expected to increase further to a decade high of approximately 68 percent in FY23, the report stated.', 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/meghna-mittal-29491/', 'name': 'Meghna Mittal'}, 'publisher': {'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Moneycontrol', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.moneycontrol.com/mcnews/images/eng-left-mc-logo-600x60.png', 'width': '600', 'height': '60'}}, 'associatedMedia': {'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2022/11/housing-finance-1-770x431-1-770x431.png?impolicy=website&width=1600&height=900', 'caption': '55% of retail credit has gone to housing, education, vehicles in last 2 years: SBI Ecowrap', 'height': '900', 'width': '1600'}}\n",

      "The shift from financial savings to physical savings was triggered by a low interest rate regime in the pandemic and recovery in the real estate sector and the increase in property prices.  \n",
      "There is a shift in financial savings from households towards physical assets like housing in the past two years, triggered by recovery in the real estate sector and low interest rate regime during the pandemic. This change in savings behaviour can have significant policy implications, particularly concerning growth and the revitalisation of investments, according to the State Bank of India’s Economic Research Department’s report, SBI Ecowrap.  “On the liability side of households, out of Rs 8.2 billion increase, Rs 7.1 billion was accounted for by increase in household borrowing from commercial banks. Juxtaposing this increase in borrowing from commercial banks with the increase in bank credit, we find that 55 percent of the retail credit to households in the last two years have gone to housing, education and vehicle purchase,” it said.  This clearly indicates that the shift from financial savings to physical savings was also triggered by a low interest rate regime in the pandemic.  “We also believe that the shift to physical assets is also triggered by a recovery in the real estate sector and the increase in property prices. The RBI House Price Index shows a modest acceleration since FY21, which may be acting as a motivator for buying homes. This increased ‘pull’ factor thereby pushing up capital spends in a multitude of sectors. If this is indeed the proximate story of the revival in household investment, this has strong policy implications for growth and investment revival,” the report mentioned.  There is a significant long run relationship between housing loans and household savings in physical assets. Every Re 1 increase in Housing loans has resulted in Rs 2.12 increase in household’s savings in physical assets for the 14 year period ended FY22.  The decline in net financial savings of households has resulted in a concomitant increase in household savings in gross physical assets. The trend is again shifting and the share of physical assets is expected to reach approximately 70 percent level in FY23, due to decline in share of financial assets. We believe that the total household savings – both financial and physical – for FY23 would still surpass the FY22 levels despite the decline in financial savings as household savings in physical assets has jumped Rs 6.5 lakh crore in FY22 over FY21 and as per current trends it is expected to jump further by up to Rs 5 lakh crore in FY23 and hence will outstrip the increase in household indebtedness,” according to the report.

In fact, the pressure on net interest margin was the fly in the ointment for the sector as a whole.  While the RBI has been on a rate hike pause, banks are facing increasing pressure of hiking interest rates further to chase depositors. Moreover, since most of their loan book has been already repriced (more than half of it is linked to external benchmark lending rate (EBLR)), analysts expect the resultant squeeze in margins to weigh on banks’ balance sheets at least for this fiscal.  “The delayed pass-through of monetary-policy rate[1]hikes in deposit rates versus lending rates, coupled with faster growth in credit versus deposits, has resulted in a near 50bp contraction in spreads between lending and deposit rates for the banking system. This is likely to lead to compression of net interest margins for the banking system in FY24 versus FY23,” AnandRathi said in a note.  But the good news is that robust credit demand, which underpins the domestic consumption engine, limits the downside for banks.  “We remain optimistic on medium-term credit growth and expect sector credit to grow 13% y-y in FY24F and FY25F, respectively.

Analyst call tracker: Despite rise in downgrades, market leader UltraTech continues to charm  Most infra firms reported healthy order wins and a strong deal pipeline.

The biggest shocker, however, was Infosys’ sharp guidance cut for the year from 4-7 percent to 1-3.5 percent.  However, Wipro emerged as the company with the most ‘sell’ calls at 18.  The IT services company reported a net profit of Rs 2,870 crore in the first quarter. Though the bottomline was up around 12 percent on year, it fell 6.6 percent on a sequential basis, largely due to a decline across all major financial metrics. The net profit also lagged the Street's estimate of Rs 2,976 crore.  Revenue grew 6 percent on year to Rs 22,831 crore but that too missed estimate of Rs 23,014 crore.

On top of that, the company rolled out a revenue growth guidance of\\xa0 -2 percent to 1 percent in constant currency terms for the July-September quarter on the back of a challenging macro environment.  Morgan Stanley highlighted that the deceleration in Wipro's revenue growth was much steeper than its peers. The firm believes that until Wipro manages to narrow that gap, its P/E discount will likely remain higher as compared to its peers.  Wipro’s Q1FY24 performance missed estimates on all fronts, ICICI Securities noted.

Simultaneously, discussions are on for raising superannuation age for managing directors of PSBs to 62 years from 60 years,&quot; the official said.  &amp;nbsp;  A final decision is yet to be taken on the retirement age for heads of PSBs and LIC, the official added.  &amp;nbsp;  Currently, the retirement age of LIC chairman is 62 years.

This has reportedly spooked several PSU banks that were planning to issue such bonds, compelling them to have second thoughts. The\\xa0subpar performance of SBI’s July bond issuance\\xa0is puzzling because the bank had raised around\\xa0Rs 3,700 crore through a similar issue at a premium of 66 basis points\\xa0over the interest rate on G-Secs in the previous quarter. That issue was oversubscribed over two times, suggesting strong investor interest in such bonds as recently as March 2023. In the Rs 10,000 crore July issuance, the bank managed to raise only about 30 percent of the amount. The large size of SBI’s July issue and its long tenure are popularly believed to be responsible for its underperformance. We offer an alternative explanation for this outcome. In 2020, a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) appointed administrator in\\xa0Yes Bank’s restructuring process\\xa0unilaterally decided to wipe out the holders of the AT1 bonds issued in 2016 and 2017 by the beleaguered bank, without writing down its equity shareholders. The administrator’s decision to prefer Yes Bank’s equity shareholders over its bondholders triggered a chain of reactions from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on the one hand and the courts on the other, which explain a general aversion towards AT1 bonds. To the extent that this aversion raises the cost of keeping Indian banks well-capitalised, this has fiscal implications for the government of India, the single largest shareholder of Indian public sector banks. More importantly, this aversion underscores the urgency with which the Supreme Court must decide the challenge to Yes Bank’s bond write-off, scheduled to come up for hearing on August 21. Appetite for bonds The success of any bond issue depends on a variety of factors — domestic and global macro-economic conditions, the financial health of the issuer, terms of the issue and investor appetite, and many of these are endogenous to one other. While it is hard to pin down a causal explanation for the underperformance of a bond issuance, an overview of the issuances in the current fiscal suggests that there is an appetite for the bonds of both PSU and non-PSU banks.  The above table dilutes the force of some of the reasons, such as large issue size and longer tenure, that were offered in the press to explain the bond issue’s poor performance. Public and private sector banks have made issues that are comparable to the SBI’s issue in size and maturity in the previous quarter, suggesting that there seems to be a prima facie appetite for large issue sizes with long maturity periods.\\xa0 Also, to be noted is the overall buoyancy in the bond market — over Rs 3.50 lakh crore worth of fresh bonds issued in the first four months of the year. Regulatory Action Impact AT1 bonds are contingent convertible bonds, which, unlike vanilla bonds, can be written down or converted into equity shares of the issuer, on the occurrence of pre-defined contingencies, generally linked to the issuer’s financial health. The decision to write off Yes Bank’s AT1 bonds in 2020 prompted SEBI to take several steps to protect investors from the risks inherent in such bonds. A\\xa0key step\\xa0was capping the exposure that mutual funds could take to AT1 bonds and mandating that the bonds be valued by mutual funds at an effective maturity of 100 years. While all the AT1 bonds are ‘perpetual’ bonds de jure, they come with a call option at five years maturity. Banks have exercised this option in all such bonds issued so far, thus making them bonds of five years maturity, de facto. Valuing these bonds at a maturity of 100 years suppresses their valuations, making them unattractive for asset managers. This valuation rule\\xa0kicked in\\xa0from April 2023, providing one possible explanation for the undersubscription of SBI’s AT1 bond issuance of July. Another step taken by SEBI was to restrict retail investors’ access to such bonds, by measures such as raising the minimum allotment value and minimum lot size for secondary trading in these bonds to Rs 1 crore. At about the same time, amidst an outcry over these bonds having been missold to investors, SEBI penalised Yes Bank and its private wealth management team for having sold such bonds to individual investors. These regulatory actions triggered by the AT1 bond write-off are likely to have affected both investor interest and the general distribution chain for selling such bonds. Uncertainty Generated By Courts The aversion created by the regulatory restrictions is amplified by the uncertainty created by courts in dealing with the challenge to the write-off. In 2021, some AT1 bondholders challenged the decision of Yes Bank’s administrator to force them to absorb the losses suffered by the bank before equity holders. While the Bombay High Court set aside the administrator’s decision at the beginning of this year, the victory was precariously perched on technicalities and short-lived. In this\\xa0article, we had critiqued the High Court judgement\\xa0for not questioning the fairness of the administrator’s decision which upended a cardinal principle of corporate finance of equity shareholders as the first loss absorbers without offering any reasons for doing so. A reasoned determination of this question was critical to the case at hand and for Indian banking generally.\\xa0 The RBI challenged the Bombay High Court’s decision in the Supreme Court and the matter is now awaiting a substantive hearing on merits. A\\xa0similar write-off was done in March 2023 by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) in Credit Suisse’s rescue plan, giving this issue a global dimension. The SNB’s decision triggered statements by the ECB and the Bank of England reassuring the public that they would not resort to such write off in restructuring banks in their own jurisdictions. We\\xa0believe\\xa0that\\xa0this would have implications on the way the Indian Supreme Court\\xa0would look at the decision of Yes Bank’s administrator, if it does decide to look into the merits of the decision. The underwhelming performance of SBI’s AT1 bond issue is perhaps indicative of the new normal for subordinated bonds issued by banks and financial institutions. Banks may have to significantly increase the premium offered on these bonds, given the uncertainties associated with the loss absorption hierarchies.

      "Why investors were lukewarm to SBI’s July AT-1 bond issuance\n",
      "The underwhelming performance of SBI’s AT1 bond issue is perhaps indicative of the new normal for subordinated bonds issued by banks and financial institutions. Banks may have to significantly increase the premium offered on these bonds, given the uncertainties associated with the loss absorption hierarchies\n",
      "On July 13, the State Bank of India (SBI) issued a new series of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds.  The issue was widely viewed as having performed poorly – the bank raised just about a third of what it had set out to do, despite offering a premium of 100 basis points over the interest rates on government securities (G-Secs). This has reportedly spooked several PSU banks that were planning to issue such bonds, compelling them to have second thoughts. The subpar performance of SBI’s July bond issuance is puzzling because the bank had raised around Rs 3,700 crore through a similar issue at a premium of 66 basis points over the interest rate on G-Secs in the previous quarter. That issue was oversubscribed over two times, suggesting strong investor interest in such bonds as recently as March 2023. In the Rs 10,000 crore July issuance, the bank managed to raise only about 30 percent of the amount. The large size of SBI’s July issue and its long tenure are popularly believed to be responsible for its underperformance. We offer an alternative explanation for this outcome. In 2020, a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) appointed administrator in Yes Bank’s restructuring process unilaterally decided to wipe out the holders of the AT1 bonds issued in 2016 and 2017 by the beleaguered bank, without writing down its equity shareholders. The administrator’s decision to prefer Yes Bank’s equity shareholders over its bondholders triggered a chain of reactions from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on the one hand and the courts on the other, which explain a general aversion towards AT1 bonds. To the extent that this aversion raises the cost of keeping Indian banks well-capitalised, this has fiscal implications for the government of India, the single largest shareholder of Indian public sector banks. More importantly, this aversion underscores the urgency with which the Supreme Court must decide the challenge to Yes Bank’s bond write-off, scheduled to come up for hearing on August 21. Appetite for bonds The success of any bond issue depends on a variety of factors — domestic and global macro-economic conditions, the financial health of the issuer, terms of the issue and investor appetite, and many of these are endogenous to one other. While it is hard to pin down a causal explanation for the underperformance of a bond issuance, an overview of the issuances in the current fiscal suggests that there is an appetite for the bonds of both PSU and non-PSU banks.  The above table dilutes the force of some of the reasons, such as large issue size and longer tenure, that were offered in the press to explain the bond issue’s poor performance. Public and private sector banks have made issues that are comparable to the SBI’s issue in size and maturity in the previous quarter, suggesting that there seems to be a prima facie appetite for large issue sizes with long maturity periods.  Also, to be noted is the overall buoyancy in the bond market — over Rs 3.50 lakh crore worth of fresh bonds issued in the first four months of the year. Regulatory Action Impact AT1 bonds are contingent convertible bonds, which, unlike vanilla bonds, can be written down or converted into equity shares of the issuer, on the occurrence of pre-defined contingencies, generally linked to the issuer’s financial health. The decision to write off Yes Bank’s AT1 bonds in 2020 prompted SEBI to take several steps to protect investors from the risks inherent in such bonds. A key step was capping the exposure that mutual funds could take to AT1 bonds and mandating that the bonds be valued by mutual funds at an effective maturity of 100 years. While all the AT1 bonds are ‘perpetual’ bonds de jure, they come with a call option at five years maturity. Banks have exercised this option in all such bonds issued so far, thus making them bonds of five years maturity, de facto. Valuing these bonds at a maturity of 100 years suppresses their valuations, making them unattractive for asset managers. This valuation rule kicked in from April 2023, providing one possible explanation for the undersubscription of SBI’s AT1 bond issuance of July. Another step taken by SEBI was to restrict retail investors’ access to such bonds, by measures such as raising the minimum allotment value and minimum lot size for secondary trading in these bonds to Rs 1 crore. At about the same time, amidst an outcry over these bonds having been missold to investors, SEBI penalised Yes Bank and its private wealth management team for having sold such bonds to individual investors. These regulatory actions triggered by the AT1 bond write-off are likely to have affected both investor interest and the general distribution chain for selling such bonds. Uncertainty Generated By Courts The aversion created by the regulatory restrictions is amplified by the uncertainty created by courts in dealing with the challenge to the write-off. In 2021, some AT1 bondholders challenged the decision of Yes Bank’s administrator to force them to absorb the losses suffered by the bank before equity holders. While the Bombay High Court set aside the administrator’s decision at the beginning of this year, the victory was precariously perched on technicalities and short-lived. In this article, we had critiqued the High Court judgement for not questioning the fairness of the administrator’s decision which upended a cardinal principle of corporate finance of equity shareholders as the first loss absorbers without offering any reasons for doing so. A reasoned determination of this question was critical to the case at hand and for Indian banking generally.  The RBI challenged the Bombay High Court’s decision in the Supreme Court and the matter is now awaiting a substantive hearing on merits. A similar write-off was done in March 2023 by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) in Credit Suisse’s rescue plan, giving this issue a global dimension. The SNB’s decision triggered statements by the ECB and the Bank of England reassuring the public that they would not resort to such write off in restructuring banks in their own jurisdictions. We believe that this would have implications on the way the Indian Supreme Court would look at the decision of Yes Bank’s administrator, if it does decide to look into the merits of the decision. The underwhelming performance of SBI’s AT1 bond issue is perhaps indicative of the new normal for subordinated bonds issued by banks and financial institutions. Banks may have to significantly increase the premium offered on these bonds, given the uncertainties associated with the loss absorption hierarchies. Meanwhile, it is imperative that the Supreme Court decide the legal challenge on the AT1 bond write-off on merits. Investors need to know what they are buying, and regulators need to know whether their discretion in bank restructuring exercises is unbound or bound by the need to explain extraordinary decisions that reverse the fundamental tenets of corporate finance.

Over a billion dollars worth of stock have been offloaded since the window for insider sales reopened for companies that have reported their earnings. The Street is divided on this trend. The arguments for and against insider selling remains the same. Veterans say that promoter selling is not as reliable an indicator of the stock being overvalued as much as promoter buying is an indicator of the shares being undervalued.  Besides, the supply of shares has been absorbed without a hiccup, pointing to strong appetite among investors — both institutional and retail. There is merit in this argument. But what about the fact that so many promoters have been selling their shares at the same time.  One theory doing the round is that promoters are aware that their shares are no longer cheap after the recent run-up. Also, they feel the market could    move into a consolidation phase shortly as speculation over the outcome of the general elections could hold many investors back from making big purchases. At this point, the odds are heavily in favour of the NDA returning to power though views vary on the margin of victory. To that extent, the market already appears to be pricing in political stability and continuity of the existing policies.  So, election results may not necessarily be the key trigger to take the market to the next orbit: An NDA victory seems almost a given as far as Dalal Street is concerned. So, the focus will once again shift to earnings and execution. In many cases, the market appears to have priced in earnings two years ahead.  Considering these factors, it may not be a bad idea to take some money off the table, promoters feel, since share prices are unlikely to rise at the same pace in the near future, as they have been over the last year.  And, here is something that the new investors may not be aware of, but old investors would only know too well. While many mid and small cap companies have suddenly become stock market darlings, it is during a bull run that you see the earnings at their best. That is also because promoters realise it is worth showing all the profits on the books as the market will reward them with a higher market capitalisation.  Interest rates  Even as the market bets on the RBI cutting interest rates by the end of 2023, looks like borrowers may have to put up with rising rates for a while. Karur Vysya Bank has hiked the lending rates by 25 basis points across tenures with effect from August 7. Over the last month, three banks — SBI, Bank of India and South Indian Bank — have raised the lending rates by 5-10 basis points across tenures.  Higher for longer  In the US, too, yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is close to its highest level in over a decade as investors bet that the economy will continue to strengthen even as the interest rates stay high. This is bad news for home-owners looking to refinance their mortgages, and also those in the queue to buy a home. At the same time, it is good news for risk-averse savers and to pension funds that have been forced for years to take greater risks to meet return targets.  SBI contrarian  Most analysts have retained their bullish ratings on SBI after the first quarter earnings. An exception to the trend is HSBC, which has downgraded its rating to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’ earlier.  Analysts Abhishek Murraka, Rahil Shah and Priyesh Jain feel the bank will hurt from a double whammy of rising deposit costs and a highly competitive environment in which demand for corporate loans is low, forcing banks to offer highly attractive rates.  “Incrementally, we believe it will be difficult for SBI to prevent net interest margin (NIM) compression. In an environment where NIM and operating costs are both under pressure, fees become an important lever. However, SBI’s fee/assets remain low at 48 bps (annualised) in the quarter.

      "The odds are heavily in favour of the NDA returning to power though views vary on the margin of victory. To that extent, the market already appears to be pricing in political stability and continuity of the existing policies\n",
      "“History has shown over and over, that bull markets can go well beyond rational valuation levels as long as outlook for future earnings is positive.” - Peter Bernstein  After a brief lull, the sale of shares by promoters has resumed with vigour. Over a billion dollars worth of stock have been offloaded since the window for insider sales reopened for companies that have reported their earnings. The Street is divided on this trend. The arguments for and against insider selling remains the same. Veterans say that promoter selling is not as reliable an indicator of the stock being overvalued as much as promoter buying is an indicator of the shares being undervalued.  Besides, the supply of shares has been absorbed without a hiccup, pointing to strong appetite among investors — both institutional and retail. There is merit in this argument. But what about the fact that so many promoters have been selling their shares at the same time.  One theory doing the round is that promoters are aware that their shares are no longer cheap after the recent run-up. Also, they feel the market could    move into a consolidation phase shortly as speculation over the outcome of the general elections could hold many investors back from making big purchases. At this point, the odds are heavily in favour of the NDA returning to power though views vary on the margin of victory. To that extent, the market already appears to be pricing in political stability and continuity of the existing policies.  So, election results may not necessarily be the key trigger to take the market to the next orbit: An NDA victory seems almost a given as far as Dalal Street is concerned. So, the focus will once again shift to earnings and execution. In many cases, the market appears to have priced in earnings two years ahead.  Considering these factors, it may not be a bad idea to take some money off the table, promoters feel, since share prices are unlikely to rise at the same pace in the near future, as they have been over the last year.  And, here is something that the new investors may not be aware of, but old investors would only know too well. While many mid and small cap companies have suddenly become stock market darlings, it is during a bull run that you see the earnings at their best. That is also because promoters realise it is worth showing all the profits on the books as the market will reward them with a higher market capitalisation.  Interest rates  Even as the market bets on the RBI cutting interest rates by the end of 2023, looks like borrowers may have to put up with rising rates for a while. Karur Vysya Bank has hiked the lending rates by 25 basis points across tenures with effect from August 7. Over the last month, three banks — SBI, Bank of India and South Indian Bank — have raised the lending rates by 5-10 basis points across tenures.  Higher for longer  In the US, too, yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is close to its highest level in over a decade as investors bet that the economy will continue to strengthen even as the interest rates stay high. This is bad news for home-owners looking to refinance their mortgages, and also those in the queue to buy a home. At the same time, it is good news for risk-averse savers and to pension funds that have been forced for years to take greater risks to meet return targets.  SBI contrarian  Most analysts have retained their bullish ratings on SBI after the first quarter earnings. An exception to the trend is HSBC, which has downgraded its rating to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’ earlier.  Analysts Abhishek Murraka, Rahil Shah and Priyesh Jain feel the bank will hurt from a double whammy of rising deposit costs and a highly competitive environment in which demand for corporate loans is low, forcing banks to offer highly attractive rates.  “Incrementally, we believe it will be difficult for SBI to prevent net interest margin (NIM) compression. In an environment where NIM and operating costs are both under pressure, fees become an important lever. However, SBI’s fee/assets remain low at 48 bps (annualised) in the quarter. Given credit costs likely to normalise as well, we believe earnings growth will likely remain lacklustre for SBI over FY24-25,” the trio write, adding that SBI’s earnings growth will be slower relative to peers.  RBL Bank  After drawing flak for its investment in RBL Bank, Mahindra and Mahindra has promised investors and analysts that it will maintain a disciplined approach towards capital allocation, primarily focusing on its core areas – auto, farm, financial services, IT services, and selected growth areas within the group.

The idea to create a super mobile app with all banking services and facilities such as e-commerce and shopping came from the bank’s desire to set up a digital marketplace to attract young customers.  “It was increasingly becoming clear to me that we had to do something remarkably different from the run-of-the-mill apps to catapult SBI as a leader in the digital space as well,” former SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said in his book The Custodian of Trust, describing the journey and early days of YONO.

In a note that comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi exuded confidence of winning a third term and India galloping to being the third largest till 2029, SBI economists said India’s real GDP will grow at over 6.5 per cent in FY24.  &quot;The path taken by India since 2014 reveals that India is likely to get the tag of the third largest economy in 2027 (or FY28) based on actual GDP data as on March 2023, a movement of 7 places upwards since 2014, when India was ranked 10th and two years earlier than our previous forecast of 2029,” the economists said in the note.  PM Modi-led NDA government came to power in 2014. The RBI estimates the real GDP to grow at 6.5 per cent, which is one of the highest estimates by any watchers. At present, India is the fifth largest economy in the world. The SBI report said the GDP will grow at 8.1 per cent in the first quarter of FY24, which ensures that the overall expansion surpasses 6.5 per cent.  Stating that the economy is in a &quot;sustained goldilocks” period, the economists at the state-owned lender said becoming the third largest economy will be a &quot;remarkable achievement by any standards” for India. The incremental increase of USD 1.8 trillion estimated in the economy’s size between 2022-27 will be more than the current size of the Australian economy, the economists said.  India’s share in the global GDP will be 4 per cent by 2027, they said, adding that the economy will add 0.75 trillion to its overall size every two years. Such a pace of GDP expansion will make India a USD 20 trillion economy by 2047 when the nation will be celebrating a century of its existence as a free state.  A nominal growth of 11-11.5 per cent or a real growth of 6.5-7 per cent per annum will help India’s compounded annual growth rate come to 8.4 per cent, it said, adding that such a growth is &quot;eminently possible”. Among states, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh will breach the USD 500 billion mark on their respective GSDP by 2027, the report said, adding the Yogi Aditynath-ruled northern state is the &quot;land of the midnight sun”.  The note also said that PM Modi’s recent visits to the US and France will deliver significant long-term economic gains for India in areas of onshoring of chip manufacturing, defence relationship, climate transition and climate finance, trade disputes and creation of special economic zones.', 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/pti-6883/', 'name': 'PTI'}, 'publisher': {'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Moneycontrol', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.moneycontrol.com/mcnews/images/eng-left-mc-logo-600x60.png', 'width': '600', 'height': '60'}}, 'associatedMedia': {'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2021/09/gdp-1280.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1600&height=900', 'caption': 'SBI economists say India to be 3rd largest economy by 2027, advance estimate by 2 yrs', 'height': '900', 'width': '1600'}}\n",

In a note that comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi exuded confidence of winning a third term and India galloping to being the third largest till 2029, SBI economists said India’s real GDP will grow at over 6.5 per cent in FY24.  &quot;The path taken by India since 2014 reveals that India is likely to get the tag of the third largest economy in 2027 (or FY28) based on actual GDP data as on March 2023, a movement of 7 places upwards since 2014, when India was ranked 10th and two years earlier than our previous forecast of 2029,” the economists said in the note.  PM Modi-led NDA government came to power in 2014. The RBI estimates the real GDP to grow at 6.5 per cent, which is one of the highest estimates by any watchers. At present, India is the fifth largest economy in the world. The SBI report said the GDP will grow at 8.1 per cent in the first quarter of FY24, which ensures that the overall expansion surpasses 6.5 per cent.  Stating that the economy is in a &quot;sustained goldilocks” period, the economists at the state-owned lender said becoming the third largest economy will be a &quot;remarkable achievement by any standards” for India. The incremental increase of USD 1.8 trillion estimated in the economy’s size between 2022-27 will be more than the current size of the Australian economy, the economists said.  India’s share in the global GDP will be 4 per cent by 2027, they said, adding that the economy will add 0.75 trillion to its overall size every two years. Such a pace of GDP expansion will make India a USD 20 trillion economy by 2047 when the nation will be celebrating a century of its existence as a free state.  A nominal growth of 11-11.5 per cent or a real growth of 6.5-7 per cent per annum will help India’s compounded annual growth rate come to 8.4 per cent, it said, adding that such a growth is &quot;eminently possible”. Among states, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh will breach the USD 500 billion mark on their respective GSDP by 2027, the report said, adding the Yogi Aditynath-ruled northern state is the &quot;land of the midnight sun”.  The note also said that PM Modi’s recent visits to the US and France will deliver significant long-term economic gains for India in areas of onshoring of chip manufacturing, defence relationship, climate transition and climate finance, trade disputes and creation of special economic zones.\n",

While the RBI has largely come to the end of the rate-tightening cycle, the rate-setting panel is expected to remain on the pause mode for rest of the year with a chance of a rate cut if inflation eases on a sustainable basis, economists have said.  &amp;nbsp;\", 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/author/moneycontrol-news-7285/', 'name': 'Moneycontrol News'}, 'publisher': {'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Moneycontrol', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.moneycontrol.com/mcnews/images/eng-left-mc-logo-600x60.png', 'width': '600', 'height': '60'}}, 'associatedMedia': {'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2022/10/392738491-653x435.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1600&height=900', 'caption': 'SBI hikes lending rate by 5 bps across tenures from today', 'height': '900', 'width': '1600'}}\n",

Since May, RBI has hiked interest rates by 225 basis points to fight inflation. One bps is one hundredth of a percentage point.  The jump in lending rates is seen as a ripple effect of the rate hikes being implemented by the Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI since mid-last year, in a bid to tame inflation.  RBI while announcing the decision to pause the repo rate in June 2023, Governor Shaktikanta Das also signalled the central bank’s readiness to act in keeping with the incoming data.  While the RBI has largely come to the end of the rate-tightening cycle, the rate-setting panel is expected to remain on the pause mode for rest of the year with a chance of a rate cut if inflation eases on a sustainable basis, economists have said.  &amp;nbsp;\n",

      "Khara’s salary included Rs 27 lakh basic pay and Rs 9.99 lakh dearness allowance. In the previous fiscal year, Khara earned Rs 34.42 lakh in annual salary\n",
      "State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Dinesh Khara took home Rs 37 lakh in the fiscal year 2022-2023 marking a jump of around 7.5 percent from the previous year, according to the bank’s annual report. SBI is India's largest bank by assets.  Khara’s salary included Rs 27 lakh basic pay and Rs 9.99 lakh dearness allowance. In the previous fiscal year, Khara earned Rs 34.42 lakh in annual salary for the financial year ending 2021-22 (FY22), 13.4 percent higher than what his predecessor Rajnish Kumar drew during FY21.  Khara joined SBI as a probationary officer in 1984 and took over as the bank chairman in October 2020. He previously served as MD of the bank in charge of global banking and SBI subsidiaries, among others.  SBI managing director C S Setty drew a salary of around the same figure as Khara in fiscal year 2023 which included Rs 26.3 lakhs basic pay and Rs 9.7 lakhs dearness allowance while former MD Ashwani Bhatia who served till May 31, 2022 took home a salary of Rs 5.7 lakhs. Bhatia later joined as wholetime member of markets regulator Securities and exchange board of India.  Other top officials, S Janakiraman and A K Tewari got Rs 36 lakhs each while A K Choudhari took home  Rs 28.5 lakhs, according to the annual report.  According to the annual report,  with an objective to continuously improve corporate governance, a reputed external consulting organisation assisted the bank in laying down parameters for performance evaluation of directors, Chairman, Board level committees and central Board as a whole. The organisation also facilitated the performance evluation process, the annual report said.  &quot;The performance evaluation of the Board has validated the Board of Directors’ confidence in the governance values of the Bank, the synergy and collaboration amongst the Board of Directors and the top Management,&quot; the report said.  SBI said with effect from 25th October 2019, sitting fees of Rs70,000 is paid for attending the meetings of the central Board and Rs30,000 for attending the meetings of other Board level Committees. Non-Executive NonOfficial Directors of the Bank are paid sitting fee for attending the meetings the Board/ Committees of the Board.  There has been a long-standing debate on the salary disparity between top bankers in public sector and private sector banks. Typically, top executives at private sector banks get far higher annual compensation compared with that of state-run banks.  To give a perspective, Axis Bank managing director and chief executive officer (MD &amp;amp; CEO) Amitabh Chaudhry was the highest-paid private bank chief in India in the previous financial year, drawing a total of Rs 7.62 crore in annual salary, as per the bank’s FY22 annual report.  Chaudhry was also separately granted a total of 412,938 stock options of Axis Bank during FY22, on the basis of approval received from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Axis Bank annual report said. The stock options were granted at Rs 726.25 per share.  Chaudhry was followed by IndusInd Bank chief Sumant Kathpalia, who made over Rs 7.31 crore in annual salary in FY22. Kathpalia was followed by ICICI Bank MD Sandeep Bakhshi, who earned Rs 7.05 crore in annual salary last fiscal, as per the bank’s annual report.  HDFC Bank MD &amp;amp; CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan pulled in Rs 6.51 crore during the previous fiscal, while Bandhan Bank MD C.S. Ghosh drew Rs 4.35 in annual salary in FY22. HDFC Bank executive director Kaizad Bharucha, meanwhile, earned more than the lender’s MD during the previous fiscal, drawing a total of Rs 10.64 crore, including performance bonuses.  &amp;nbsp;\n",

They project hefty earnings per share (EPS) growth for the benchmark Nifty 50 every financial year, only to eat their words soon after.  Since FY12, Nifty earnings estimates have been revised downwards, notes Ambit Capital in a recent report. “Analysis indicates that in any financial year, EPS estimates have, on average, been revised downwards by 16 percent over the last two years, and by 8 percent on average over the last one year,” it said.  And even if the headline estimates were met, the earnings breadth remained poor. Some sectors, such as financials in FY23, powered the earnings story while sectors like consumer and utilities failed to deliver.    FY24 will be no different, believes Ambit Capital. In fact, more pain might be in store in FY24. Here’s a sector-wise analysis of the same.  Banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI)  Buoyed by repo rate hikes, banks saw a significant jump in net interest margins (NIMs) in the year gone by. The banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector contributed 195 percent to Nifty’s EPS growth ― from Rs 730 in FY22 to Rs 842 in FY23.  According to Ambit Capital, the earnings trajectory will likely change in FY24 with BFSI's contribution to incremental earnings growth tapering to 43 percent. “Loan growth will moderate to 12-14 percent from 15-16 percent as credit growth in corporate stays muted and deposit growth stays anchored at 10 percent,” it said.  Valuation-wise, the firm’s pecking order is\\xa0Axis Bank, SBI, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank,\\xa0and Kotak Bank.  Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)  Last year, price hikes helped boost the topline of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies. Now, as inflation recedes, these companies have to start taking price cuts to help get back volumes.  But balancing the price-volume equation will be tricky, believe analysts. That’s because rural consumers will first prioritise deleveraging themselves, then invest in income-generating assets and eventually shift from unbranded to branded products.  “It would take some time for FMCG companies to revert to normalised volume growth of mid to high single digits,” according to Ambit Capital’s analysts.

      "Nifty earnings estimates revised downward every year since FY12. Will it be different for FY24?\n",
      "And even if the headline estimates were met, the earnings breadth remained poor\n",
      "Analysts are an optimistic bunch. They project hefty earnings per share (EPS) growth for the benchmark Nifty 50 every financial year, only to eat their words soon after.  Since FY12, Nifty earnings estimates have been revised downwards, notes Ambit Capital in a recent report. “Analysis indicates that in any financial year, EPS estimates have, on average, been revised downwards by 16 percent over the last two years, and by 8 percent on average over the last one year,” it said.  And even if the headline estimates were met, the earnings breadth remained poor. Some sectors, such as financials in FY23, powered the earnings story while sectors like consumer and utilities failed to deliver.    FY24 will be no different, believes Ambit Capital. In fact, more pain might be in store in FY24. Here’s a sector-wise analysis of the same.  Banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI)  Buoyed by repo rate hikes, banks saw a significant jump in net interest margins (NIMs) in the year gone by. The banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector contributed 195 percent to Nifty’s EPS growth ― from Rs 730 in FY22 to Rs 842 in FY23.  According to Ambit Capital, the earnings trajectory will likely change in FY24 with BFSI's contribution to incremental earnings growth tapering to 43 percent. “Loan growth will moderate to 12-14 percent from 15-16 percent as credit growth in corporate stays muted and deposit growth stays anchored at 10 percent,” it said.  Valuation-wise, the firm’s pecking order is Axis Bank, SBI, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Kotak Bank.  Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)  Last year, price hikes helped boost the topline of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies. Now, as inflation recedes, these companies have to start taking price cuts to help get back volumes.  But balancing the price-volume equation will be tricky, believe analysts.

The mood appears to have changed rapidly from pessimism to caution and then to cautious optimism and now bullishness.

In the last 24 months, at least 10 former bankers have joined the boards of fintech companies. Experts attribute this to a bigger corporate strategy to gain the trust of investors and customers, besides seeking smooth relations with regulators on compliance issues.  Such moves assume significance as fintech companies are facing tighter regulatory scrutiny on a range of issues related to corporate governance, lending norms, and the array of activities these companies can participate in.  For example, recently Bengaluru-based-Razorpay appointed N S Vishwanathan, former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as an advisor to the board. Also, the fintech company hired the former managing director (MD) of State Bank of India (SBI) and the former chairman of HDB Financial Services, Arijit Basu, as an advisor. Razorpay is one of the largest fintech companies in the country with operations in the payments segment. According to the company’s annual financial report, its operating revenue jumped 76.1 percent to Rs 1,481 crore in financial year 2021-22 (FY22) from Rs 841 crore in FY21.    Similarly, Bengaluru-based slice roped in former executive director (ED) of RBI, Eugene Emmanuel Karthak, as an independent director. The company also hired S Vishvanathan, ex-MD, SBI, for an advisory role, in March 2023.  Perhaps, one of the biggest such moves in the fintech space took place when BharatPe hired former SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar, and former RBI deputy governor B P Kanungo as non-executive chairman and independent director, respectively, in September 2022. Kumar is also an advisor to Gurugram-based digital lender Indifi Technologies.  There are other examples too. Delhi-based fintech company Stashfin appointed former MD and CEO of SBI Card, Vijay Jasuja, as a non-independent ED in September 2022, while EbixCash roped in Uma Shankar, former ED, RBI, as an independent director.  That apart, Qwikcilver, a digital gift card fintech company based in Bengaluru, appointed former RBI ED G Padmanabhan as an advisor in August 2016.

Why are retired bankers in demand?  So, why are fintech company running to hire former bankers? According to experts, such hiring is part of a bigger corporate strategy to gain the trust of investors and customers, besides seeking smooth relations with regulators on compliance issues.    “Fintech companies have issues with regulatory requirements and business operations compliances. Industry experts can help mitigate these issues,” said Chandan Sinha, former ED, RBI.  Fintechs are a booming market. According to data from the government's Invest India portal, the Indian fintech industry's market size is expected to grow to $150 billion by 2025 from $50 billion in 2021. The sector is also expected to have $1 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and nearly $200 billion in revenue by 2023, data from Invest India said.  Also, the government has plans for growing and expanding the reach and innovation in the fintech sector.

They need guidance on several issues,” said Rajnish Kumar of SBI.  Sinha said the experience of veteran bankers can help fintech companies formulate policies in the short to medium term.  Dealing with regulatory challenges  Over the last few years, the regulator has upped scrutiny on fintech companies.  RBI, in August 2022, introduced new guidelines for fintech companies operating in the digital lending space. Under the guidelines, fintech companies are required to disclose all costs upfront in a digital loan product to the customer, even as they are not allowed to scrub or read borrowers’ smartphones. In August 2022, ratings agency CRISIL highlighted that the new rules will raise the operational intensity and compliance costs for lenders in the near term.  Also read:\\xa0Budget 2023: Fintechs, NBFCs look out for a liquidity booster from FM for financial inclusion  Ajay Kumar Choudhary, ED, RBI, highlighted that the regulator has to keep a watchful eye on fintechs and the associated risks.  &quot;Regulators need to keep a watchful eye on the risks by fintech companies and big techs. The risks posed by fintech start-ups and big techs are different,&quot; said Choudhary at the Moneycontrol Fintech Conclave.  For fintech companies, experts highlighted, the appointment of veteran bankers can help formulate operational tactics around regulatory issues. Ram Rastogi, Chairman of Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE) said that fintechs earlier did not look at governance and corporate aspects of the business.  “After the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) crisis, some of the major fintech players had to take a second look at their governance and compliance work. This is where they are looking at making policies clear and hiring banking sector experts,” Rastogi said.  Sinha said that sector experts can guide fintech companies on macro policies. “Fintech companies need to know what is permissible under their sector. They need a regulatory perspective on how to look at business,” Sihna said.  Former bankers in advisory roles  When former bankers join the boards of companies, they do not have a day-to-day role to play in the business of the fintech company. Instead, these former central bankers and chiefs of banks act as guides to these fintech companies.  According to experts, these bankers attend weekly or monthly meetings where major issues around the company’s operations are discussed.  Also read:\\xa0Increased scrutiny of bank-fintech alliance puts start-up ecosystem at risk  “As an advisor or member of the board, they are not required to come or participate in the daily running of the company. They have to work as advisors or consultants discussing macro and major issues related to the company, such as scaling operations, regulatory aspects, etc.,” said Rastogi.  Sinha said the 30-40 years of sector experience of the bankers help them work around the bigger issues concerned with fintech companies.  “Veteran bankers have seen the ups and downs of business. Their experience can help fintech companies decide their growth plans,” said Sinha.  For instance, Kumar's tenure as the chairman of SBI ended in October 2020, following which he joined BharatPe, and later in 2022, also became an advisor to Indifi. Kumar, while highlighting his role as the advisor, said that most of the fintech companies are young at less than five to six years.  &quot;As an advisor, we give them guidance. Especially, at this stage we give them advice not only on regulatory issues but also on compliance and other growth operations,&quot; said Kumar.  Alok Mittal, CEO of Indifi Technologies, said that hiring veteran bankers who have witnessed industry evolutions through the years help the fintech companies in adapting the business to new paradigms.  “Hiring former bankers and fintech experts can lead to a powerful combination towards growth. Our experienced bank heads provide insights on how to scale responsibly and mitigate risks,” Mittal added.   Also read:\\xa0Why is RBI’s Payment Aggregator License significant for fintech companies?

They need guidance on several issues,” said Rajnish Kumar of SBI.  Sinha said the experience of veteran bankers can help fintech companies formulate policies in the short to medium term.  Dealing with regulatory challenges  Over the last few years, the regulator has upped scrutiny on fintech companies.  RBI, in August 2022, introduced new guidelines for fintech companies operating in the digital lending space. Under the guidelines, fintech companies are required to disclose all costs upfront in a digital loan product to the customer, even as they are not allowed to scrub or read borrowers’ smartphones. In August 2022, ratings agency CRISIL highlighted that the new rules will raise the operational intensity and compliance costs for lenders in the near term.  Also read: Budget 2023: Fintechs, NBFCs look out for a liquidity booster from FM for financial inclusion  Ajay Kumar Choudhary, ED, RBI, highlighted that the regulator has to keep a watchful eye on fintechs and the associated risks.  &quot;Regulators need to keep a watchful eye on the risks by fintech companies and big techs. The risks posed by fintech start-ups and big techs are different,&quot; said Choudhary at the Moneycontrol Fintech Conclave.  For fintech companies, experts highlighted, the appointment of veteran bankers can help formulate operational tactics around regulatory issues. Ram Rastogi, Chairman of Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE) said that fintechs earlier did not look at governance and corporate aspects of the business.  “After the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) crisis, some of the major fintech players had to take a second look at their governance and compliance work. This is where they are looking at making policies clear and hiring banking sector experts,” Rastogi said.  Sinha said that sector experts can guide fintech companies on macro policies. “Fintech companies need to know what is permissible under their sector. They need a regulatory perspective on how to look at business,” Sihna said.  Former bankers in advisory roles  When former bankers join the boards of companies, they do not have a day-to-day role to play in the business of the fintech company. Instead, these former central bankers and chiefs of banks act as guides to these fintech companies.  According to experts, these bankers attend weekly or monthly meetings where major issues around the company’s operations are discussed.  Also read: Increased scrutiny of bank-fintech alliance puts start-up ecosystem at risk  “As an advisor or member of the board, they are not required to come or participate in the daily running of the company. They have to work as advisors or consultants discussing macro and major issues related to the company, such as scaling operations, regulatory aspects, etc.,” said Rastogi.  Sinha said the 30-40 years of sector experience of the bankers help them work around the bigger issues concerned with fintech companies.  “Veteran bankers have seen the ups and downs of business. Their experience can help fintech companies decide their growth plans,” said Sinha.  For instance, Kumar's tenure as the chairman of SBI ended in October 2020, following which he joined BharatPe, and later in 2022, also became an advisor to Indifi. Kumar, while highlighting his role as the advisor, said that most of the fintech companies are young at less than five to six years.  &quot;As an advisor, we give them guidance. Especially, at this stage we give them advice not only on regulatory issues but also on compliance and other growth operations,&quot; said Kumar.  Alok Mittal, CEO of Indifi Technologies, said that hiring veteran bankers who have witnessed industry evolutions through the years help the fintech companies in adapting the business to new paradigms.  “Hiring former bankers and fintech experts can lead to a powerful combination towards growth. Our experienced bank heads provide insights on how to scale responsibly and mitigate risks,” Mittal added.   Also read: Why is RBI’s Payment Aggregator License significant for fintech companies?  Brand-building  Some experts also suggested that when fintech companies hire a veteran banker, a certain goodwill also comes along.  “A veteran banker has a name and reputation in the industry. Hence, when they join a fintech company, there are chances that the fintech company develops a certain goodwill,” said Sinha.\n",

      "Two more Adani Group companies pledge equity in favour of SBICAP Trustee\n",
      "The equity was pledged by both the Adani group firms on March 6. This comes almost a month after the two companies, along with Adani Ports, had pledged shares to SBICap Trustee.\n",
      "The promoters of Adani Transmission and Adani Green Energy have pledged equity of 0.76 percent and 0.99 percent in favour of SBICAP Trustee Company, a unit of the country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI).  The equity was pledged by both the Adani group firms on March 6. This comes almost a month after the two companies, along with Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), had pledged shares to SBICAP Trustee, CNBC TV-18 reported on March 8.  The trustee had on February 11 said it had pledged for 1 percent of Adani Ports, 0.55 percent of Adani Transmission and 1.06 percent of Adani Green.  The listed entities of Adani group suffered a hammering at the stock market after January 24, when the US-based short seller Hindenburg Research released a report alleging stock manipulation and accounting fraud by the ports-to-power conglomerate.  After weeks of rout, Adani group firms recorded a sharp recovery of shares in the market last week, as global asset management firm GQG Partners announced a cumulative investment of Rs 15,446 crore in four entities: Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, Adani Ports and Adani Transmission.  In the five trading sessions up till March 6, the flagship Adani Enterprises rose by a whopping 66 percent.  On March 7, the embattled conglomerate announced that it has prepaid the Rs 7,374-crore (more than $900 million) share-backed financing made by various international and domestic financial institutions, about two years ahead of its latest maturity date. The group further pledged to prepay all remaining loans by the end of March.\n",
