Consistent market share gains, organic ARPU improvements and controlled costs have boosted Bharti’s EBITDA, offsetting the higher capex internally and continued deleveraging. Over the next couple of years, we believe that BHARTI will continue to benefit from the favorable market construct, which should result in improvements in FCF and ROCE. The company is expected to execute awaited tariff hikes in the next couple of quarters, which could act as a catalyst for the stock, in our view. Outlook We assign FY26E EV/EBITDA of 12x/5x to India Mobile/Africa businesses and arrive at our SoTP-based TP of INR1,570. We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock. We believe two rounds of tariff hikes over the next two years could take India EBITDA to INR882b and Bharti TP to INR1,700 on 11x EV/EBITDA.

On the weekly charts, profit-booking is evident at higher levels, with the index sustaining at a three-week low, albeit respecting its significant support level of the 13-week EMA (exponential moving average) after a brief correction.  On lower time frames such as daily charts, the index is moving within an upward sloping channel pattern, nearing its important support zone at the lower edge of the channel pattern.  In terms of levels, immediate resistance is notable at 22,500, a significant level on higher time frames, with further resistance seen at 22,780 and 23,170. Conversely, crucial support levels are identified at 21,700 and 21,500.  Considering the prevailing chart patterns, a prolonged bullish phase is anticipated for the longer term. Consequently, it is advisable to seek buying opportunities near the support level, with potential upside targets ranging from 22,500 to 22,780. To effectively mitigate risk, implementing a strict stop-loss strategy at 21,700 on a closing basis is recommended.  Here are three buy calls for short term:  Samvardhana Motherson International: Buy | LTP: Rs 126 | Stop-Loss: Rs 116 | Target: Rs 152 | Return: 20 percent  Samvardhana Motherson is currently displaying robust momentum, trading at its 52-week high.

In addition, comparing Samvardhana Motherson against the Nifty on a ratio chart reveals a breakout of a prior downward sloping trend line connecting from 2017. This breakout suggests outperformance and indicates continued strength relative to the broader market index.  Going ahead we expect the prices to go higher till the level of Rs 152. the bullish view will be negated if we see prices sustaining below Rs 116 level.  Bharti Airtel: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,266 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,163 | Target: Rs 1,480 | Return: 17 percent  Bharti Airtel is currently hitting its highest point ever, demonstrating robust momentum in its price structure since 2018.

Additionally, the ratio chart of Bharti Airtel against the Nifty indicates sustained outperformance as the ratio line continues its upward trajectory.  Going ahead, we expect the prices to go higher till the level of Rs 1,480. The Bullish view will be negated if we see prices sustaining below Rs 1,163 level.    Tata Power Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 430 | Stop-Loss: Rs 400 | Target: Rs 528 | Return: 22 percent  Tata Power has been on an upward trajectory since May 2020 until April 2022.

Brokerage firm IIFL Securities said that players such as Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio could benefit from ‘higher-than-expected tariff hikes’.  At 2:42 pm, the stock was trading at Rs 1,279.95 on the NSE, up 5.22 percent.  Follow our market blog for live updates  In a report released this week, IIFL Securities analysts said that they expect to see two rounds of tariff increase in the next three years, which could benefit all three telcos - Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio.  &quot;While we were already building a 20 percent tariff increase in H2FY25, we now build in another round of 15 percent tariff increase in FY2027,&quot; said the report. This could come as good news for telecom companies, who often grapple with paper thin margins and low tariffs.  Additionally, the brokerage also believes that there is a  decent chance of a reduction in Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) liability, which could be a positive for Bharti and Vi. The brokerage has raised the target price for Bharti Airtel to Rs 1,379. This implies an upside of 13 percent from the last close of Rs 1,216.15.

However,  high debt and volatile financial performance in the past few years are key concerns.","Bharti Hexacom’s Rs 4,275-crore IPO opened on April 3 and will close on April 5, marking the first public stock sale by the Bharti Airtel group in 12 years. Also, it is the first public issue of the new financial year 2024-25. The last IPO before this from the Bharti group was that of Bharti Infratel, now known as Indus Towers, which was listed back in 2012.  Several analysts have assigned a subscribe rating to the issue owing to reasonable valuation and strong parentage. However, high debt and volatile financial performance in the past few years are key concerns.  Offer details  Bharti Hexacom is a subsidiary of Bharti Airtel. The issue is entirely an offer-for-sale of 7.5 crore shares. This means that the entire proceeds will go to the selling shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India, which will dilute a 15 percent stake. The price band for Bharti Hexacom IPO has been fixed at Rs 542-570 per share.  Promoter Bharti Airtel holds a 70 percent stake in the company, and Telecommunications Consultants India holds the remaining 30 percent stake.  Should you subscribe to the issue?  Choice: Subscribe  The domestic telecommunication market is effectively operating with a duopoly structure. Bharti Hexacom, promoted by Bharti Airtel, gains from synergies with its parent company and affiliates. “Considering the higher entry barrier for the new players, continued capex requirement and higher spectrum costs, we believe, there will be continued improvement in the operating &amp;amp; financial performance of the company in the medium term. We assign a ‘Subscribe’ rating to the issue,” said analysts at Choice Equity Broking.  Marwadi Financial: Subscribe  Considering the trailing 12-months (Dec 2023) and FY24 annualised EPS of Rs 9.67 and Rs 7.52, respectively, on a post-issue basis, the company is going to list at a P/E of 58.95x / 75.80x with a market cap of Rs 28,500 crore, whereas Bharti Airtel is trading at a P/E of 63.3x. “We assign a ‘Subscribe’ rating to this IPO as the company has strong parentage and an established brand along with a presence in markets with high growth potential. Also, it is available at a reasonable valuation as compared to its peers,” said analysts at Marwadi Financial Services.  AUM Capital: Subscribe  Bharti Hexacom is expected to leverage Bharti Airtel’s launch of 5G services across the country. “The company aims to maintain an efficient capital structure with high balance sheet flexibility. It is vouching to repay its debt obligations through internal accruals as it holds liquid investments and cash worth Rs 2,000 crore at the end of December 31, 2023. We would hence recommend a ‘Subscribe’ to the issue,” said analysts at AUM Capital.  Financials    Bharti Hexacom offers consumer mobile services, fixed-line telephone and broadband services under the brand Airtel to customers in Rajasthan and the North East telecommunication circles in India. It recorded a 67.2 percent on-year decline in net profit at Rs 549.2 crore in FY22-23, primarily due to a higher base owing to exceptional gains of Rs 1,951.1 crore in the previous year.

","Jefferies has reaffirmed its bullish stand on Bharti Airtel as the telecom major focusses on driving a steady, organic increase in its per-user average revenue.  The global brokerage maintained its 'buy' call on Bharti Airtel with a target price of Rs 1,300 per share. This implied an upside of around 5.5 percent.  The telco has been attempting to step up its ARPU by improving its subscriber mix and better monetisation.  According to the brokerage, there is clear headroom for tariff hikes, but the timing remains uncertain. Raising the tariffs will be the key for 5G monetisation and improving ROCEs.  Jefferies added that the Bharti Airtel management expects capex to moderate from FY25 onwards. The company is aiming to deleverage its balance sheet further.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live action  On March 18, Jefferies shared a list of its top 11 picks with potential to deliver returns at a compounded annual growth rate of 15-25 percent over the next five years. The stocks, ranging across sectors, were selected based on two major themes - strong fundamentals and long-term plays.  Bharti Airtel was among the 11 stocks chosen. The brokerage expects a 12 to 13 percent CAGR in India revenue or EBITDA from 2024 to 2030, driven by market share expansion and higher ARPU.  The generation of consistent free cash flow is seen as a factor that could lead to a shift in valuation benchmarks towards free cash flow yields, Jefferies believes.

The IPO comprises only an offer-for-sale (OFS) of 10 crore equity shares by the only public shareholder Telecommunications Consultants India, with no fresh issue component. This means the entire issue proceeds (excluding IPO expenses) will go to the selling shareholder.  According to the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) filed by the communications solutions provider with the market regulator on January 19, promoter Bharti Airtel holds a 70 percent stake (35 crore equity shares) and the remaining 30 percent shareholding (equivalent to 15 crore equity shares) is held by non-promoter Telecommunications Consultants India.

In SEBI parlance, the issuance of an observation letter means the company can launch its IPO within the next one-year period.  Bharti Hexacom, which offers consumer mobile services, fixed-line telephone and broadband services under the Airtel brand to customers in Rajasthan and the North East, recorded a net profit of Rs 549.2 crore in FY23, a decline of 67.2 percent compared to the previous year.

AIRTEL,2024-03-18T07:02:00+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Experts line up top 10 bets for next 3-4 weeks as Nifty hints at range-bound movement,"For the Nifty, support is at 21,900-21,850 and, below this, the bears will have a wider room to run riot. The index may face resistance at 22,200-22,300. A decisive close above the zone can take it to record highs, say experts.","The market went into the red after a green sweep for five weeks in a row and fell more than 2 percent at the end on March 15. Given the nervousness in the Street, bears took the plunge, paving the road for more volatility with a negative bias in the coming sessions. Experts see support for the market barometer at 21,900-21,850 and, below this, the bears will have a wider room to run the riots. On the higher side, the Nifty may face resistance at 22,200-22,300 and a decisive close above this may charge the bulls to drive the index to record highs.  For the week ended March 15, the Nifty 50 declined 470 points to 22,023 and formed a long bearish candlestick pattern which resembles Evening Star kind of a pattern (not the exact one) on the weekly charts with high volumes.  On the downside, there are visible multiple bottoms on the hourly chart in the range of 21,900 to 21,850, coinciding with the 50EMA (exponential moving average), suggesting critical support, Rajesh Bhosale, technical analyst at Angel One said. &quot;Further decline below this level may trigger another round of significant selling, potentially pushing prices towards the previous swing low of 21,500, aligning with the 89EMA.&quot;  Going ahead, he advised caution and asked traders to refrain from attempting to catch the falling knife and, instead, wait for clear bullish reversal signals before considering aggressive long positions.  Jigar Patel, senior manager of equity research at Angel One, also feels that on the downside, 21,850 stands as a crucial support level, and a breach of this level might push the index towards the 21,600 level.  The current breakdown would only be invalidated if the index closes above 22,200, said Patel, who feels the market uncertainty will likely dissipate by the end of the month, allowing the markets to resume their primary upward trend.

Besides being more liquid, large caps also appear attractively valued compared to the second-line stocks that have suddenly fallen out of favour ","When the market was on an upswing, mid-cap and small-cap indices had outpaced the Sensex and Nifty by a mile. A similar trend is playing out on the way down as well. So far this week, the mid and small-cap indices have fallen by as much as 9 percent, compared to a 2 percent decline in the bigger indices.  Analysts expect this divergence to continue as they see panic-stricken investors flocking to the safety of large-caps. Besides being more liquid, large-caps also appear attractively valued compared to the second-line stocks that have suddenly fallen out of favour.  Top large-cap stocks experts are betting on  Deven Mehata, Equity Research Analyst, Choice Broking  Maruti Buy: Rs 11,400 | Stop Loss: Rs 11,000 | Target: Rs 12,300  The stock is trading very close to its all-time high of 11,730 at 11,400 levels. The critical support level at 11,000, closely aligned with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), signifies historical buying interest and provides a foundation for the stock's price stability. Crucially, Maruti is trading above all significant moving averages, emphasising its underlying strength and positive sentiment.  On the higher side, once the stock surpasses 11,730 resistance, it can move towards 12,300 levels and higher. Meanwhile, 11,000 serves as a potential stop for downward movements. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 54.96, indicating a supportive environment for price gains. It's not yet in overbought territory, suggesting room for further growth.  L&amp;amp;T Buy: Rs 3,550 | Stop Loss: Rs 3,400 | Target: Rs 3,730 - 3,900  The stock has found substantial support around 3,400 levels. The recent robust bounce from this support suggests a bullish stance for LT. The potential for further upward movement, potentially reaching new all-time highs, is underlined by the stock's resilience at key support levels.  A breakthrough above the resistance at 3,635 could catalyze a strong upward movement, approaching the all-time high levels of 3,730 and beyond. This analysis suggests a favorable outlook for LT, supported by technical indicators pointing towards potential bullish momentum in the upcoming sessions.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live action  Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel One  TCS Buy: Rs 4,200 - 4,100 | Stop Loss: Rs 3,940 | Target: Rs 4,750  The IT giant has experienced an impressive rally in recent months, breaking out of a prolonged consolidation phase. While the broader market has been under pressure in the last few sessions, this particular stock has shown remarkable resilience and is now trading in uncharted levels. Looking at the weekly chart, we can see that prices have surged past a significant consolidation breakout pattern known as the 'saucer' formation.  Following this breakout, any minor pullbacks or consolidation phases have been met with buying interest. Despite indicators signaling overbought conditions, they also reflect the stock's underlying strength. Traders are advised to consider purchasing this stock at its current market price or on any subsequent dips.  HDFC Bank Buy: Rs 1,445 - 1,420 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,360 | Target: Rs 1,600  This prominent banking heavyweight has been a key contributor to the recent underperformance of the Bank Nifty. However, amid the recent market turmoil, this stock has shown resilience, displaying a relatively muted reaction and appears to be establishing a support base at attractive levels. This consolidation phase aligns with the long-term support of the 200-weekly moving average and is accompanied by robust trading volumes.  There's notable positive divergence evident, wherein although prices have reached new lows, oscillators have not, suggesting substantial accumulation of this stock at lower levels. Additionally, the recent closure of prices above the 20-day exponential moving average (20EMA) on the daily chart indicates a shift towards positive momentum in the short term. Given these factors and the favorable reward-to-risk ratio, we maintain a strong bullish outlook on this stock.

On the daily charts, the Nifty 50 maintained an upward sloping resistance trendline adjoining the previous record highs, which is a positive sign.  &quot;From a technical perspective, there has been a bullish flag breakout observed on the daily scale of the Nifty index, indicating a potential target price of around 22,800.

Looking ahead, he feels 22,500 could act as an immediate resistance, with a close above this level possibly leading to further gains towards 22,800.

AIRTEL,2024-03-07T16:22:49+05:30,Ashwin Mohan,"Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners ups the ante in India with bets on Bharti Airtel, Lodha",The investment firm manages more than $127 billion in assets globally. ,"“Remember what Chuck Prince said in 2007: you’ve got to dance when the party’s on. But our view is you can’t wait till the music stops; you’ve got to make some preparations. Technology is no longer the next growth spot; it’s yesterday’s growth spot.”  That’s Rajiv Jain, alluding to the quote by the former chief executive of Citigroup.  And as far as India is concerned, the party seems to have just begun for the Founder, Chairman and Chief Investment Officer of the Florida-based asset manager GQG Partners.  This week, the firm has placed two significant bets in the Indian markets. First, GQQ Partners invested $711 million to buy Singtel’s 0.8 percent stake in telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd.  The transaction is the latest in Singtel’s efforts to unlock value from its assets following a strategic reset in 2021.  Referring to GQG Partners’ investment, the firm’s chief financial officer, Arthur Lang, said, “We’re pleased to have raised S$0.95 billion while adding a marquee name to Airtel’s share base.”  Second, against the backdrop of a 61% surge in the Nifty Realty index in the past six months, GQQ Partners emerged as one of the key allottees in the $400 million QIP launched earlier this week by Macrotech Developers (formerly called Lodha Developers). The funds will be used to reduce debt and acquire land.  The firm first made headlines in India last year for its contrarian bets on the Adani Group during the Hindenburg crisis.  Its initial investment of $1.9 bn in Adani Group companies in March 2023 has galloped to a valuation of $10 bn by late February.  One GQG Partners transaction that stood out during this phase was the mega $1.1 billion block deal for a stake of around 8 percent in Adani Power on August 16.  But it’s not just the Adani Group that has caught the fancy of Jain, who bought his first stock in high school and has been managing other people’s money for more than two decades.  JSW Energy, IDFC First Bank, GMR Airports and Patanjali Ayurved are also part of the India portfolio of GQG Partners.  So, what exactly is Rajiv Jain’s investment mantra?  “Our goal is quite simple: to compound our clients’ capital over time. To do this, we need to protect assets in difficult markets and participate in rising markets. We have developed an investment approach that strives to do just that, based on a lens we call forward-looking quality,” Jain is cited on the firm’s website.  And what does the lens of forward-looking quality mean?  “This concept ignores the traditional investment constraints associated with growth and value and instead focuses on investing in companies that we believe are going to be successful over the next five years and beyond,” Jain said.  Though some market experts expressed concerns regarding the fund’s exit strategy, given its chunky stakes in firms with limited interest from institutional investors, Jain’s colleague Sudarshan Murthy, a senior portfolio manager, stressed the firm’s “long-term view” in a recent interview to Moneycontrol.  GQG’s client base comprises institutional investors, including endowments, pension funds, and corporates, but Murthy maintains that despite operating as a public markets fund, GQG’s private equity-like bottom-up fundamental approach sits well with its investors, and there is no pressure to return capital before time.  Importantly, Murthy shared that GQG is pursuing more such contrarian investments in India akin to its Adani bets. He told Moneycontrol the firm is attracting a steady stream of Indian promoters seeking “confidence capital”.  The debt-laden Vedanta Group is not one of them for the time being, at least.  Rajiv Jain clarified that GQG Partners has “not purchased a single Vedanta share” in a recent interaction with CNBC TV-18 following rumours of the firm’s involvement in a large trade linked to the metals major.  When it comes to overseas bets, GQG has bet on the likes of heavyweights like Nvidia Corp., Meta and Alphabet.  So, when it comes to India, what’s next for the investment firm, which is majority-owned by its employees and manages more than $127 billion globally in client assets?  Trust Jain to be well-prepared before the band, baaja and baraat stop!",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rajiv-jains-gqg-partners-ups-the-ante-in-india-with-bets-on-bharti-airtel-lodha-12420331.html

Hence, a minor weakness with immediate support at 22,200 can't be ruled out, experts said, adding that 22,000 and 21,850 are expected to be key support areas, with hurdle for the Nifty 50 on the higher side at 22,500, and then at 22,600.  On March 5, the benchmark indices corrected for the first time in the last five sessions with the BSE Sensex ending down 195 points at 73,677 and the Nifty 50 shedding 49 points to 22,356, forming a small red candle with upper and lower shadows which resembled the Doji kind of candlestick pattern - and not an identical one - on the daily timeframe, indicating a tug-of-war between the bulls and the bears.  The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices also corrected, losing 0.3 percent and 1.2 percent.  Stocks that outperformed the broader markets on Tuesday included Bharti Airtel, Balaji Amines and Solar Industries.

The stock closed at Rs 7,760 and traded well above all key moving averages.  Riyank Arora | Technical Analyst at Mehta equities Ltd  Here's what Riyank Arora of Mehta Equities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Bharti Airtel  The stock is giving a breakout from its falling wedge pattern and showing overall good signs of momentum and strength. With the overall trend being positive and a sharp volume pick-up in the counter, it is expected that the stock should head higher towards potential targets of Rs 1,190 and Rs 1,200 with a strict stop- loss at Rs 1,140 mark.    Balaji Amines  The stock has given a good breakout above its recent swing high mark of 2345. Volume in Tuesday's session was nearly 14 times its average 30-day volume.  The next resistance, as per technicals, is now placed at Rs 2,490 mark above which upside would open towards Rs 2,689. A strict stop-loss should be kept at Rs 2,300 for all active longs on the stock.    Solar Industries  The stock is approaching a crucial breakout mark of Rs 7,832.90 on its daily as well as weekly charts. Any move above Rs 7,835 should trigger a major upside move in the stock towards Rs 8,000 and Rs 8,200 levels.  A strong support is placed at Rs 7,400 mark, below which the stock would lose its strength, so a stop-loss can be kept at the same.

AIRTEL,2024-03-04T06:46:20+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Experts line up top 10 trading ideas for March series as Nifty scales historic high,"Experts expect the momentum to sustain in the coming weeks, too, with immediate resistance at 22,500-22,600, followed by the medium-term target of 23,000, provided it holds the upward sloping resistance trendline","Bulls retained their reign on Dalal Street for the third week in a row, continuing with a higher-high formation, and charging the benchmark Nifty 50 to a historic high of 22,420. The index found support in the 10-week exponential moving average to end with 0.75 percent gains at a new closing high of 22,378 for the week ended March 2.  Experts expect the momentum to sustain in the coming weeks, too, with immediate resistance at 22,500-22,600, followed by the medium-term target of 23,000, provided it holds the upward sloping resistance trendline (adjoining previous record high levels), while the support is placed at 22,200 and 22,000 levels.  Intermittent correction can't be ruled out, experts warned, given the divergence in the momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) as the price makes higher highs and indicator makes lower highs.  &quot;Any moderate market dip should be viewed as a buying opportunity. A close below the 22,000 level in the upcoming week could signal weakening bullish sentiment, potentially prompting a retest of the 21,800 support level,&quot; Jigar S Patel, senior manager for equity research at Anand Rathi, said.  He said the levels to watch out for in the current week would be 22,500 - 22,600 on the higher side, and 22,000 - 21,800 on the lower side. Therefore, he advised traders to monitor the key support and resistance levels closely and remain flexible in their trading strategies.  Rohit Srivastava, founder of Strike Money Analytics and Indiacharts, feels the optimism comes from the new all-time high in the Nifty. &quot;The trendline of the highs gives us a resistance near 22,360 above which the Nifty needs to be able to sustain for a few days before we can qualify it as a sustainable breakout and not a false breakout,&quot; he said.  Other than that multiple divergences in indicators like the RSI (relative strength index) make it look like a topping process in the market, he feels.  Moneycontrol collated a list of top 10 stock ideas from experts with 2-4 weeks perspective. The closing price of March 2 is considered for the stock return calculation.  Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, head equity research at Kotak Securities  BPCL: Buy | LTP: Rs 625 | Stop-Loss: Rs 605 | Target: Rs 670 | Return: 7 percent  After the downward trend from the levels of around Rs 680, the bearish trend took a pause.

The stock price is currently placed at the edge of breaking above the key moving average hurdles like weekly 10/20-week EMA (exponential moving average) around Rs 920-930 levels respectively.  The medium-term weekly chart pattern is signaling a possible upside breakout of broader range movement. This is positive indication. The volume has started to expand during upside breakout in the stock price in last week and the daily RSI shows positive indication. The overall chart pattern of PEL indicates long trading opportunity.  Buying can be initiated in PEL at CMP (Rs 935), add more on dips down to Rs 900, wait for the upside target of Rs 1,035 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 875.    AGI Greenpac: Buy | LTP: Rs 881 | Stop-Loss: Rs 820 | Target: Rs 990 | Return: 12 percent  After showing a rangebound action in the last one month, the stock price AGI has witnessed a sharp upside breakout in last week.

One may look to buy AGI Greenpac at CMP (Rs 881), add more on dips down to Rs 850 and wait for the upside target of Rs 990 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 820.    Expert: Om Mehra, technical analyst at SAMCO Securities  Bank of Baroda: Buy | LTP: Rs 271.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 259 | Target: Rs 290 | Return: 7 percent  The stock reveals a strong recovery after a notable consolidation, forming a sturdy base in support of a rising trendline. The stock is currently trading above the 20-day SMA (simple moving average), indicating positive momentum.  The daily chart reveals that volume is ticking up with price rise. Moreover, the RSI is gradually inching higher indicating bullishness in stock.  Hence, based on the above technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP Rs 271.8 for a target price of Rs 290. The stop-loss can be kept at Rs 259.    NMDC: Buy | LTP: Rs 234.70 | Stop-Loss: Rs 219 | Target: Rs 260 | Return: 11 percent  The stock shifted from an accumulation phase, accentuated by a surge in volume, signalling a robust bullish setup. Significantly, the delivery volume in the last couple of days grown significantly.  The stock actively holds above 50 simple moving averages (SMA) confirming its upward trajectory. The RSI holds firmly the 50 level.  Hence, based on the above technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP Rs 234.7, for a target price of Rs 260. The stop-loss can be kept at Rs 219.    Expert: Riyank Arora, technical analyst at Mehta Equities  HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,430.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,350 | Target: Rs 1,520 | Return: 6 percent  The stock has successfully tested its long-term anchor VWAP (volume-weighted average price) support zone. On its daily charts, the stock has continuously tried to find support at Rs 1,380 levels, whereas the Rs 1,460-1,470 zone saw some selling pressure.  With the long-term charts being positive and the price being near anchor VWAP support zones, it is expected that the stock should gradually move above Rs 1,480 and head towards Rs 1,520 mark in the next 3-4 weeks.    Apollo Hospitals Enterprises: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,133 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,925 | Target: Rs 6,300 and Rs 6,500 | Return: 6 percent  On daily charts, the stock has been moving in an uptrend and successfully touched its trendline in Friday's session. It saw a long wick rejection below the trendline, indicating good buying at lower levels in the stock.  Going forward, Rs 5,940 is going to be a major support for Apollo Hospitals, so a strict stop-loss at Rs 5,925 should be kept for potential upside targets of Rs 6,300 and Rs 6,500 in the next 2-3 weeks.  Expert: Jigar S Patel, senior manager - equity research at Anand Rathi  Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,724 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,665 | Target: Rs 1,820 | Return: 5.6 percent  Following a peak close to Rs 1,926 level, Kotak Mahindra Bank underwent a substantial decline of around 10 percent in its value. However, in the past month, the bank has established a prolonged bottom around the 1.13 harmonic ratio. Interestingly, a bullish AB=CD pattern has also emerged near the aforementioned ratio, providing further bullish confirmation.  Additionally, on the indicator front, there is a bullish divergence observed on the daily stochastic (please refer to the chart), indicating a positive outlook for the stock. Consequently, one may consider buying in the range of Rs 1,705-1,730 with an upside target of Rs 1,820 and a stop-loss set at Rs 1,665.

AIRTEL,2024-02-28T16:28:27+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Sharp rise in market share for Bharti Airtel in Hexacom markets shows superior execution: Jefferies,The analysts believe that this trend will continue given the lower teledensity in the regions--Rajasthan and North East--in which the subsidiary operates.  ,"There's been a sharp rise in market share for Bharti Airtel in its Hexacom markets, according to Jefferies latest report.  The analysts believe that this trend will continue given the lower teledensity in the regions--Rajasthan and North East--in which the subsidiary operates.  Bharti Hexacom is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bharti Airtel. The company's 70 percent is held by Bharti Airtel and 30 percent by the Government of India through Telecommunication Consultants of India Ltd (TCIL). This January, Bharti Hexacom filed for an IPO issue, which will allos the government to sell its stake, as the 10 crore shares that are to be offered for sale are currently held by TCIL.  Also read: Vodafone Idea's fundraise plan sparks hope but telco not out of the woods, say analysts  The brokerage said, in its February 27 report on the telecom major: &quot;Bharti's market share in Hexacom's circles at 43.5% is higher than its pan-India market share of 37.7% (Rajasthan-41%, North East-54%).&quot;  It added, &quot;Notably, while Bharti gained 740bps market share since FY20, when tariffs started to rise, to become the market leader in Hexacom's circles, Jio's market share has been flattish since then at 41-42% levels. This is in contrast to ROI (Rest of India), where both Jio (+790bps) and Bharti (+600bps) gained market share since FY20.&quot;  These numbers reflect a &quot;superior execution&quot; in Hexacom markets, according to the analysts.  They noted that, in ROI, VIL had 29 percent market share in FY20 which reduced to 16.6 percent by 9MFY24. During this phase, both Bharti and Jio gained 6ppts and 7.9ppts, respectively. In contrast, in Hexacom's markets, VIL had 16.4 percent market share in FY20 which fell to 10.6 percent in 9MFY24 and this entire market share shift was in favor of Bharti Airtel.  &quot;Given that similar market share gains have not materialized across all markets, we believe Bharti's gains in Hexacom's markets reflects its superior execution in these markets,&quot; they wrote.  The brokerage also added that tariff hikes have translated better in Hexacom's markets.  Also read: Bharti Airtel gains on 'buy' call from Jefferies, Sunil Mittal’s Rs 300 ARPU target  They wrote, &quot;Bharti Airtel has been the biggest beneficiary of tariff hikes, witnessing a 13% CAGR in ARPU (based on active subs) over Dec-19 to Dec-23 period vs. 11% and 8% CAGR for VIL and Reliance Jio respectively. Its ARPU growth in Hexacom's markets is even higher at 17% CAGR vs. 12% CAGR in ROI implying that translation of tariff hikes into ARPU has been better in these markets.&quot;  (Disclaimer: MoneyControl is a part of the Network18 group.

AIRTEL,2024-02-28T12:23:44+05:30,Zoya Springwala,"Vodafone Idea's fundraise plan sparks hope but telco not out of the woods, say analysts","Brokerages says since the fundraise is not substantial enough, it will have a limited impact on Vodafone Idea's competitors","Vodafone Idea Ltd's board approval of a fundraising totalling Rs 45,000 crore offers a glimmer of hope to the cash-strapped telecom company.  The funds will allow Vodafone Idea (Vi) to expand its 4G network and rollout 5G services. These moves should help the company regain some of its competitive edge by offering a better experience to its users, analysts said. However, they said the fundraise is too small to have a meaningful impact on the company's market share and its overall debt position.  Vodafone Idea shares plunged more than 13.6 percent in intraday trading on February 28.  Impact of fundraise on Vodafone Idea’s operations  The fundraising will help the company cover upcoming dues, start 5G rollout and improve its operational performance, brokerage Nomura said.    Vi can do this by curtailing the decline in the subscriber base in the near term and start growing the subscriber base again in the coming years.  Though the fundraising plan is a step in the right direction, the deployment of funds in the right areas will be crucial for Vodafone Idea going ahead, said Manish Chowdhury, Head of Research, StoxBox.  ALSO READ: Voda Idea's Rs 20k-cr equity fundraise likely to be a mix of FPO and preferential allotment to promoter  How does it affect Vodafone Idea's competitors?  The industry is in a repair phase, said Morgan Stanley. As the industry realigns its focus, there could be a potential increase in tariffs. The brokerage added that even if Vodafone Idea's fundraise closes successfully, there will be little change in the industry’s dynamics as the current market structure will continue in the near-term.  If the telecom operator had a more financially secure position, it would be able to compete more effectively in the industry and arrest the subscriber decline. “Improving its competitiveness in the industry and rolling out 5G should enable Vi to return to a growth trajectory in terms of subscriber additions,” said Nomura.    However, since the fundraise is not substantial enough, it will have a limited impact on Vodafone Idea's competitors. Vodafone Idea has been losing subscribers and is far behind its peers in terms of the 5G rollout.   Also Read | Vodafone Idea Board approves fundraise of up to Rs 45,000 crore via equity and debt; promoters to participate  Nuvama Institutional Equities said, “Both Bharti and Jio have already rolled out 5G in 5,000-plus cities and towns, and there is an urgent need for VIL to incur capex for 5G rollout and to upgrade the 4G network. The company needs to improve both its operational and financial metrics, to withstand competition.”  &quot;From a consumer perspective, we do not rule out tariff hikes in the near future as both Jio and Airtel try to recover capital costs incurred in the past and make their operations more sustainable and well-rounded,&quot; said Manish Chowdhury.  Should you buy, sell or hold Vodafone Idea?  The markets have already discounted the fundraising development, per Prashanth Tapse, senior VP, Mehta Equities. “We can see a limited upside up to Rs 17-18 in the best case scenario, therefore we remain neutral on this development.”  The fundraise hasn’t changed Vodafone Idea’s precarious situation. The company’s high debt levels, persistent subscriber losses and inability to do 5G capex and upgrade the network has resulted in Nuvama Institutional Equities maintaining its &quot;reduce&quot; rating on the stock, with a price target of Rs 7.  Vi’s debt problems linger as the operator also faces significant government dues pertaining to adjusted gross revenue (AGR) and spectrum liabilities, noted Nomura. This resulted in the brokerage reiterating its ‘reduce’ call, with a target price of Rs 6.5 per share.  CLSA's negative view is a result of an likely financial crunch in FY26CL for VIdea, over and above capex and 5G rollout, when annual spectrum and AGR payments to GoI of $4 billion per annum will be due. This is 3x the current cashflow. CLSA had a sell call with a Rs 5 target on the counter.

Its revenue came in at Rs 38,339 crore, up 6.3 percent from Rs 36,062 crore in the year-ago period, Bharti Airtel said in an exchange filing.  The revenue met expectations, and net profit was below the Street estimates.  Brokerages expected net profit to rise 47 percent year-on-year and 14 percent sequentially to Rs 3,308.50 crore.  Analysts factored in net subscriber addition of 3.6 million and ARPU of Rs 205, up 1.1 percent QoQ given a better mix with more users converting to 4G from 2G.  The company said its mobile average revenue per user per month (ARPU) was at Rs 208 - better than estimates - and up nearly 8 percent against Rs 193 in the same quarter last year. The ARPU was driven by &quot;consistent strategy of acquiring high value customers and improved realisations.&quot;  The stock ended the day at Rs 1,113.60 on the National Stock Exchange, up 3.23 percent.  “Revenue from India business sustained its momentum and grew sequentially by 3 percent, while the consolidated revenue was impacted by the devaluation of the Nigerian Naira and Malawian Kwacha,&quot; said Gopal Vittal, MD, Bharti Airtel.  &quot;The quarter witnessed a strong growth trajectory for the postpaid and Homes business, while our DTH business added 388k net adds – the highest in the last 12 quarters. We remain on course with our strategy of premiumisation that helped us add 7.4 million 4G/5G customers and exit the quarter with an industry leading ARPU of Rs 208.  Vittal called for tariff revision as well, which has not happened for a while.  &quot;Even at this ARPU, our return on capital employed, however, continues to be low at 9.4 percent.

In an interview with Moneycontrol on the sidelines of the WEF meeting at Davos, Mittal said India is a &quot;bright spot&quot; amid conflicts in Europe and the Middle East. &quot;People are getting a lot of relief that at least a large part of the world is growing at 6-7 percent and is likely to continue to do that in the next 10 years.&quot;  During his conversation with Moneycontrol's Chandra R Srikanth, Mittal, whose Bharti Enterprises controls telecom operator Bharti Airtel, also commented on subjects including India's upcoming general elections, Vodafone Idea, artificial intelligence and Ram Mandir. Edited excerpts:  First, give us a sense of the mood you're getting from global clients and Indian executives you've met here. What's on top of their minds? Because this is a crucial year. I think 60 percent of the world's population is going to be voting. Many people are talking about how that is a critical factor this election year.  That's certainly the topic of discussion that is coming up in almost all the key meetings. There are lots of elections this year, and I think India's upcoming one in May is also attracting everybody's attention. Although, it's pretty much a deal where everybody recognises where this election is likely to go. People are very excited about India's future growth in the next 10 years. The foundation that has been laid out in the last 10 years is now going to see a very beautiful edifice building on top of this.  So, I think everybody's excited about India, but there are concerns here in Davos around geopolitical issues. The Ukraine-Russia situation still is hogging the limelight. The Middle East war is hogging the limelight. There are certain people who are being called pessimists, but equally, there are bright spots like India, which is full of optimism. People are getting a lot of relief that at least a large part of the world is growing at 6-7 percent and is likely to continue to do that in the next 10 years.  So, it's a mixed bag. I think from last year, the overhang of the war has only got more acute with the Middle Eastern situation, but everybody's working towards sorting it out.  Also read: Davos 2024: Sunil Mittal says 3rd term for Modi govt looks likely, pitches for business continuity  You mentioned that elections are not so much of a concern because, more or less, people expect continuity there. So, is that the sense that there will be a third term for the current government? And if that is, there will be a certain sense of policy continuity and stability if Mr. Modi is voted back?  What do investors or the business community, both domestic and international, like? Continuity is very important. Continuity of reform, continuity of investments in infrastructure, ease of doing business, and all that has been very well demonstrated in the last 10 years, increasing with every year.  More importantly, what people are recognising is that the sheer scale and ambition of India is so much different from the previous decades that that is what is catching everyone's attention. And if that was the case in the last 10 years, I think the hope and promise of India that there will be continuity, that there will be strong momentum towards acceleration of infrastructure growth and economic development is there.  And that's palpable. And you can see, we don't have to sell in India anymore. People are drawing and getting attracted to us. People want to talk about business in India. 'How should we invest? Where should we invest? What all do we need to do?' So there's a lot of excitement out there. And that gives you a very clear signal of where people's minds are in terms of where the next election is going.  Will Airtel buy more spectrum in the upcoming auctions?  Let's see. We have very small chunks of spectrum getting renewed. So, I think a large part of our spectrum pool was bought last time. This is a big chunk of spectrum we bought, including very large chunks for 5G. So, barring minor participation in some renewal spectrum, there doesn't seem to be much need from our side.  How are OneWeb's launch plans panning out?  Well, we are ready. The northern part of India has been ready for some time. The southern preparations are going on, but we are still waiting for the market access and spectrum allocation to be finalised. Thankfully, the government has decided to give spectrum on an administrative basis, and rightly so, because where are we going to connect? You know, in the oceans, high seas, deserts, mountains, forests, and deep rural areas where terrestrial networks can never reach.  In terms of the overall telecom market structure, with Vodafone Idea still in the red and no relief funding in sight, what do you make of it?  It's a very, very capital-intensive industry. We have spent over Rs 30,000 crore this year on 5G. We have spent large amounts of money on 4G in the past. So a lot of investment is required. And they need to shore up their capital base.  They need to get some investors. They need to get some more debt. You need serious capital to be in this business. And that— sadly, it has not been the case for the last two or three years. Although they have bought some 5G spectrum, you need to roll out networks.  So that could be an overhang on the third operator. I wish them well. I've always said India, the size of a market in India, should have three operators. But BSNL is coming up, thankfully, and the government is doing a lot to roll out 4G there now. Plans for 5G are afoot.  So India will be served well. There will be enough competition. There will be choices for customers. The good news is India's tariffs remain one of the lowest in the world.  Also read: Davos 2024: Cash-strapped Vodafone Idea needs 'serious capital', says Sunil Mittal  How aggressively is Airtel pursuing the fair share demand from OTT companies?  Very aggressively. I think that's a legitimate demand that when we are building these very large…  ..But it starts the other debate on net neutrality.  No, absolutely not. That is where some people get mixed up. It's got nothing to do with net neutrality. Net neutrality is that the access to the net by the customer on the other side should be neutral. It will remain neutral. That's mandated in the law. You can't even break it. Nobody's saying fair share at the cost of net neutrality. Net neutrality is a given. On top of that, we're talking about fair share. That's got nothing to do with net neutrality.  So you're pursuing it aggressively?  Yeah, aggressively is wherever we can talk, we talk about it. The large four or five big consumers or guzzlers of the network capacity need to step up. And contribute towards India's rural burden. Why should the telecom operators who have a much lower ROC (return on capital) at lower ARPU's (average revenue per user) be obligated to do everything?  One thing that you're looking forward to in 2024, macro trend, micro trend?  Well, I think 5G industrial monetisation is yet to pick up anywhere in the world. I hope by 2024, before the end of this year, some solid use cases should come up. And these are not selling pure bandwidth or ARPU games; it's selling solutions—industrial solutions where low latency and large capacity are required.  So, we'll be able to get some use cases in Indian hospitals, especially the rural ones, where you could do live robotic surgeries; you could manage the drones for agriculture, surveys, and monitor springs. So, a lot of work is going on globally. I hope something strikes where you start to see the benefit of 5G.  With AI being the theme this time at Davos, how are you leveraging it across your company? And how do you plan to use it?  Well, it's a standard protocol that we have always followed: tie up with the best, have partnerships, deep partnerships. We are talking about AI almost all the time. In the company, five internal products have already been launched, and 15 are underway.  Will you look at building your own LLM?  I don't think so. There's an alliance being built among operators. We are a part of that alliance. Eight to ten of us are joining hands. In the LLM model, India actually contributes a lot because, given the population, the diversity. But we work with Google. We are working with Microsoft. We are working with all the leading AI companies to ensure we embed them for our use and our customers' use.  Ultimately, what do we want from it? Efficiency, accuracy, getting networks better, response time faster, call centres, chatbots, and, importantly, tuning of networks as the demand rises and falls in various parts of the country.  We are actively engaged in those areas. Do we need to develop our own AI to compete with the other AI providers? No, that's not the ambition.  Also read: Davos 2024: Ram Mandir, reflection of India's goodness; plan to be in Ayodhya on January 22, says Sunil Mittal  Why do you think there is so much excitement around Ram Mandir? Is it something that you will go for as well?  Well, I'm planning to be there. I think it has been an aspiration of India to see the completion of the Ram Temple, Ram Mandir. And I think all cutting across religions should be participating in it, should be looking forward to it. There's no comparison between where we are, and that comes from the heart. You have to be there because you have your belief.  Importantly, the Ram Mandir also represents the goodness of India, the Ram Rajya, which really is not necessarily pure religion itself, but everything that can be captured in a good way for the country, for the people who live there, and for everyone.  That's what that particular symbol represents. And apni, apni aastha (everyone has their own beliefs) and our own devotion towards it, everybody will go with their own kind of attraction towards Ram.

Mittal, whose Bharti Enterprises owns telecom operator Bharti Airtel, also labelled a few Over the Top/Internet companies &quot;guzzlers of network capacity&quot;, and said that such companies should shoulder some responsibility (in the form of fair share) for the strain on networks caused by their substantial bandwidth consumption.  When enquired about the Vodafone Idea situation , Mittal said, &quot;So a lot of investment is required, and they need to shore up their capital base. They need to get some investors, they need to get some more debt.&quot;  &quot;You need serious capital to be in this business. And that, sadly, has not been the case for the last two or three years... I wish them well, I've always said that with India's size of the market, the country should have three operators.

Recently, the cash-strapped company failed to get funding from US’ International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) for the deployment of OpenRAN and related technologies for the 5G network, the telecom department has said in an internal report.  According to the report, the telco may face an annual regulatory liability of over Rs 30,000 crore after its four-year payment moratorium ends in FY26.  Meanwhile, Mittal was also asked about the fair share demand, which is being spearheaded by telcos as they highlight massive strain on their networks because of excessive bandwidth consumption.  Through this fair share demand, telecom companies want internet companies to pay them a network fee based on the traffic they generate, turnover threshold, number of users and so on.  &quot;The large four, five big consumers of guzzlers of the network capacity, need to step up and contribute towards India's (network) burden,&quot; Mittal added.  He also dismissed claims that the fair share demand may go against the principle of net neutrality.  &quot;There are some people who are mixed up.

AIRTEL,2023-10-26T15:05:23+05:30,S.N.Thyagarajan,Telcos dispute over AGR resurfaces at SC with a judgment and curative petition,"On October 10, telcos sought an urgent hearing of their curative petitions challenging certain specific portions of the 2019 judgment on Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR).  ","Telecom companies are once again at loggerheads with the government, after a brief hiatus. Telcos such as Airtel and Vodafone in October, sought an urgent hearing of their curative petition against the 2019 ruling.  The telecom majors have filed a curative petition against the 2019 judgment of the Supreme Court which upheld the Department of Telecommunication’s (DoT) interpretation of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR).  Their dispute with the Income Tax Department also reached a conclusion on October 16 this year, with the SC ruling that the license fee paid to the government as per the National Telecom Policy, 1999 was to be considered a capital expenditure and not revenue expenditure.  Moneycontrol explains what these cases are and how they could impact telcos  The return of the AGR litigation  On October 10, telcos sought an urgent hearing of their curative petitions challenging certain specific portions of the 2019 judgment on Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR).  The National Telecom Policy (NTP) of 1999 permitted telecommunication companies to pay their license fee and spectrum fee to the government as a percentage of their yearly income. However, telecom companies disputed the definition of the term Gross Revenue at the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) and at the Supreme Court.  The Telcos’ contention was that AGR computation should include only those revenues the company earns from the telecommunication business. DoT contested this and said that the telcos must pay eight percent of the entire revenue to the government as license and spectrum fee.  In 2015, TDSAT held that to compute AGR, DoT has to consider only the revenue from the telecommunication business of the company. In 2019, the Supreme Court overturned TDSAT's verdict and held that AGR is to be computed on the total revenue of the company, irrespective of whether it is telecommunication-related or not. The Supreme Court's judgment imposed a penalty as &quot;No litigant can be permitted to reap fruits on such inconsistent and untenable stands and litigate for decades in several rounds, which is not so uncommon but is a disturbing scenario projected in very many cases.&quot;  As a result of this, DoT's total demand amounted to Rs 1.19 lakh crore — Vodafone Idea owed Rs 58,254 crore, Bharti Airtel Rs 43,989 crore, and Tata Teleservices owed Rs 16,798 crore to the government.  In 2020, the Supreme Court set a 10-year time frame to the companies to pay the dues. In 2021, the SC rejected Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel's plea to recompute the dues.  In 2023, the telcos filed a curative petition contending that the penalty and the interest on the penalty levied by the Supreme Court's 2019 judgment are so substantial that they threaten the existence of the company.  According to Vodafone Idea’s (VI) plea, which was filed in September 2023, &quot;The company is already on the verge of a financial crisis, which threatens its very existence, and the judgment passed by this Hon’ble Court, prohibiting even the correction of clerical and arithmetical errors in the demands, foreclosing any reduction of the amount payable by thousands of crores of rupees and further imposing a penalty and interest on penalty, is highly unjust.&quot;  VI has also asked the SC to set aside portions of the 2019 judgment which held that the demands made by DoT would be final, even if there are clerical or arithmetical errors in the computation of dues. This means that the demanded amount could not be rectified, and the company would be compelled to make payments even if there are such errors.  A curative petition is filed by a party after the apex court dismisses their plea to review a judgment. The petition should seek to reverse those portions of a judgment that, according to the party, would lead to a miscarriage of justice if not corrected.  License fee to be treated as capital expenditure:  On October 16, the SC ruled that the license fee that telcos pay every year as a percentage of their profit should be treated as capital expenditure and not as revenue expenditure. The taxable income of telcos is likely to increase owing to this judgment.  Revenue expenditures are those that businesses incur operationally during the normal course. India’s income tax law permits the deduction of revenue expenditure from the total profits. Capital expenditures are those that businesses incur to acquire an asset or upgrading themselves, these are not deductible from income. Since the SC has now ruled that license fee is a capital expenditure, the telcos may not be able to deduct the license fee from their annual income.  This issue can also be traced back to the NTP 1999, which permitted telecommunication companies to pay their license fee and spectrum fee to the government as a percentage of their yearly income. Telcos started classifying their annual license fee as revenue expenditure, since it pertains to the operation of the company. However, the I-T department contended that it would be a capital expenditure under the Income Tax Act.  The High Courts of Bombay, Karnataka and Delhi ruled in favour of the telcos. However, the Supreme Court held that the manner of payment is irrelevant and that the variable licence fee payments made after July 1999 are a continuation of the licence fee payment, which is a mandatory payment intrinsic to the trade itself.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/legal/telcos-dispute-over-agr-resurfaces-at-sc-with-a-judgment-and-a-curative-petition-11603261.html

Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd: Shares of the pharma major fell 0.3 percent to Rs 5,478, snapping its two-day gaining streak. The dip comes after the company was named as a defendant in an antitrust complaint regarding cancer drug Revlimid filed in the US. The complaint, filed by Mayo Clinic, asserted claims under America’s federal and state antitrust laws and other state laws. Mayo Clinic alleged that the defendants, including Dr Reddy’s, improperly restrained competition and maintained a shared monopoly in the sale of brand and generic Revlimid through their respective settlements of patent litigation.

This comes at a time when a debate over net neutrality has erupted over telecom companies such as Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea suggesting that OTT players pay a &quot;fair share&quot; charge toward network cost based on the number of users they have, the traffic they generate and so on.  At a media briefing, COAI's director general (retd) Lt Gen SP Kochhar said, &quot; Net neutrality concerns unbiased treatment of content and is completely unrelated to the fair share charge to be paid by OTTs to TSPs (telecom service providers). It is worthwhile to emphasise here that our member TSPs are committed to following the net neutrality principle as per their licensing conditions.&quot;  COAI's members include Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea.  Also read: MC Explains: Debate over net neutrality rears its head again  &quot;While telcos have been carrying the massive investment burden for deploying networks and delivering connectivity across the country entirely by themselves, OTT players have emerged offering bandwidth-heavy services and generating disproportionately high traffic, compelling further upgrades and capacity enhancement of the networks, but contributing nothing to the network expenses,&quot; Kochhar said.  Notably, OTT, as the name suggests, can mean any content provider that works on top of existing internet services provided by telecom companies.

AIRTEL,2023-09-07T18:46:48+05:30,Ananthu U,Analyst call tracker: Bharti Airtel target price raised amid ratings cuts; analysts search for growth,"‘Buy’ calls on Airtel stock fell from 28 to 24 in the three months to August,  whereas ‘sell’ calls increased from three to four. ","Bharti Airtel stock is among the 10 companies that saw maximum analyst downgrades in the last quarter, primarily as the run-up in the stock and absence of positive business triggers leave little room for further upside.  ‘Buy’ calls on Airtel stock fell from 28 to 24, in three months to August, Whereas, ‘sell’ calls increased from three to four, and ‘hold’ calls from one to three. The ratings downgrade came despite the brokerages raising the target prices.  Bharti Airtel's share price rose 14.2 percent during the past six months, to Rs 856.40 at the end of August. This beats NSE Nifty 50’s 10.3 percent gain in the same period.  Why analysts downgraded Airtel  “Owing to the recent rally, there’s limited upside potential to be had on this counter,” Geojit Financial Services said in a recent note. The brokerage cut Airtel’s rating from ‘buy’ to ‘hold’, saying that the recent rally in the stock would cap the upside in price.  Dolat Capital mentioned the lack of tariff hikes in the near term and the price rally as headwinds for the stock. “We thus expect Bharti to go through a time correction in the near term”, it said in a note, and downgraded Bharti Airtel’s rating from ‘accumulate’ to ‘reduce’, citing the stock’s outperformance. Prabhudas Lilladher downgraded the ratings from ‘buy’ to ‘accumulate’, (buy, but in moderation), also based on the recent rally in share price.  … And why they raised the target prices  The ratings downgrades are despite the same analyst raising target prices, prompted by the recent run up in the stock. With the telecom industry becoming more of a duopoly as Vodafone Idea struggles to stem its customer loss, Airtel and Jio are set to benefit from the consolidation.  5G, customer additions among growth factors  Geojit increased the target price on Airtel stock from Rs 926 to Rs 954 based on SOTP (sum of the parts) method, citing the roll out of the 5G network, premiumisation of customers, and growth in African business.  Airtel’s ARPU (average revenue per user) increased to Rs 200 in Q1FY24 from Rs 183 in the year-ago period, helped by 38.3 percent YoY growth in postpaid customers and 11.9 percent growth in 4G customers. Mobile services in Africa grew 16.6 percent in Q1FY24 from the previous year.  Dolat Capital’s SOTP-based target was increased from Rs 845 to Rs 865. Airtel stock has already surpassed that to hit Rs 876. Dolat Capital said the accelerated growth in home broadband and enterprise business coupled with ARPU uptick, can drive growth in the long term. Prabhudas Lilladher increased the SOTP based target price from Rs 923 to Rs 935 as they increased their “FY24/FY25 ARPU to Rs210/Rs238”.  Other brokers are also bullish on Airtel due to these factors.  Axis Securities maintained the ‘buy’ call, and increased the target price to Rs 1025, a 15 percent upside from CMP (Current Market Price) of Rs 890. Similarly, Motilal Oswal kept the ‘buy’ call and increased the target price to Rs 1020 from Rs 950.

The bullish crossover of the 21EMA (exponential moving average placed at 19,448) and 55EMA (19,292) has persisted, signaling an ongoing bullish trend. Additionally, a bullish crossover in the RSI (relative strength index) highlights the index's strength.  In the short term, Nifty may target levels of 19,750 or even 20,000. On the downside, key support rests at 19,440, and the market is expected to maintain a buy-on-dips strategy as long as this support level holds.  The banking sector witnessed choppy trading as traders struggled to find direction, resulting in heightened volatility for the Bank Nifty index. The prevailing sentiment leans towards a negative-to-sideways bias, with the index closing below a crucial moving average.  The RSI is on the verge of forming a bearish crossover, indicating potential weakness. In the short term, the index is expected to decline towards 44,000, with resistance at 44,600. Sustained trading above this level could propel the index towards 45,000 and beyond.  Selling on rallies seems to be the favoured strategy for traders in the Bank Nifty, unless the index provides a clear and decisive breakout above the 45,000 levels.  Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:  Bharti Airtel: Buy | LTP: Rs 880 | Stop-Loss: Rs 844 | Target: Rs 950 | Return: 8 percent  The stock recently broke out of a consolidation pattern on the daily chart, signaling an increasing bullish sentiment. It has also surpassed a critical moving average, further reinforcing the bullish outlook.  The RSI is in a bullish crossover, adding to the positive sentiment. In the short term, the stock is expected to target Rs 950, with support at Rs 844 providing potential downside protection.    Indian Hotels Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 431.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 410 | Targets: Rs 465-475 | Return: 10 percent  Indian Hotels is displaying promising signs, with a strong range breakout and significant volume on the daily chart. The stock is trading above both its 200-day and 50-day moving averages, further reinforcing its bullish outlook.  A daily RSI of 72 signifies strong momentum. Traders may consider a long position between Rs 422-428 levels, with a strict stop-loss at Rs 410, targeting gains of Rs 465-475.    ITI: Buy | LTP: Rs 127.70 | Stop-Loss: Rs 119 | Target: Rs 145 | Return: 13.5 percent  ITI exhibits strong technical signals, including a breakout above falling trendlines on both daily and weekly charts with substantial volume support. It's also trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.  The RSI at 70 indicates robust momentum. Consider a long position between Rs 125-127, with a tight stop-loss at Rs 119 (aligned with the 50-day moving average) and target of Rs 145 on the upside.

AIRTEL,2023-09-01T12:45:50+05:30,Ananthu U,"Bullish on India: Bharti Airtel to win as India goes digital; 5G at home, abroad fuel growth","The company is set to consolidate its position further where rivals falter, both at home and abroad, and by expanding 5G offerings, digital services and customer base.","As India’s digital economy expands to $1 trillion by 2030, driven by telecom companies, to a large extent, Bharti Airtel is likely to emerge as a big winner.  The Sunil Bharti Mittal-led telecom company has the potential to ride the digital growth, since it can bring the much-needed investments for network expansion and enhancing coverage.  Bharti Airtel is set to consolidate its position further where rivals falter, both at home and abroad, and by expanding 5G offerings, digital services and customer base.  From starting its operation in 1995, to AR Rahman’s iconic caller tune in 2002, launching India’s first 4G service in 2012 and launching 5G in October 2022, Airtel has come a long way.  Consolidation and home growth  India’s telecom market is increasingly becoming a duopoly – dominated by Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio. Several companies have gone bankrupt or have merged with other entities. Other players are bleeding money and users.  Vodafone Idea, after merging operations in 2018, is now struggling with funding issues and losing subscribers. The company lost 12.8 lakh subscribers in June 2023. It’s a similar story for BSNL, despite the PSU getting revival packages from the government. It lost 18.7 lakh subscribers in June, according to data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).  Since Reliance Industries hasn’t announced IPO plans for Jio Infocomm, Bharti Airtel has the opportunity to deliver attractive returns to investors. Analysts are also bullish on Bharti Airtel on expectations of tariff hikes.   Bullish on India  India mobile business  During the 5G spectrum auctions in 2022, the company spent Rs 43,040 crore to acquire 19,867.8 MHz spectrum, consisting primarily of 3.5 GHz and 26 GHz bands. Its India mobile services revenue increased 12 percent YoY to Rs 20,392.4 crore in Q1FY24 and the ARPU reached Rs 200.  Motilal Oswal attributed the increase in ARPU to premiumisation of customers by converting prepaid customers to postpaid ones, which almost doubled ARPU, data consumption and monetisation. The number of postpaid customers increased 13.5 percent YoY to 2 crore in this quarter.  The company also expects more demand for postpaid services as only 6 percent of its customers use postpaid in India. In markets like Brazil and Thailand, the number is high at 40-50 percent. “So the opportunity is vast in this segment and it should be a growth lever,” the brokerage said.  Airtel’s African safari: Growth sighting  Airtel started its operations in Africa in 1998 by launching in the island-nation of Seychelles. Revenue of African mobile services increased 20.4 percent YoY to Rs 11,316.8 crore in this quarter. The African mobile services revenue has now grown to more than 55 percent of the company’s India mobile revenues. The customer base grew 8.8 percent YoY to 14.3 crore.  Brokers are confident about the company’s prospects in the region. “Airtel Africa is trading at 3.5x EV/EBITDA on FY23 and 2.8x on FY25E. Airtel Africa has consistently delivered strong earnings growth for the last 3-4 years, with a ~19% CAGR over FY19-23. A strong balance sheet with low leverage and healthy FCF further adds to the strong capabilities,” said Motilal Oswal.  Home services  Motilal Oswal said the company expanded its footprints in the home business -- its fibre-based broadband services. From being present in 100 cities in FY2020, it has expanded to 1,225 cities in the last three years. This segment added 413,000 customers in the quarter and now stands at 65 lakhs. It delivered a revenue growth of 25.4 YoY to Rs 1,162.1 crore in the quarter.  According to Axis Securities, “the company has a strong strategy of hunting (offering different solutions to existing customers (mainly 50 million customers having strong financial conditions) and mining new customers”.  Bharti Airtel’s portfolio also consists of Digital TV services and Business services. The company also began testing Airtel Finance in some market places.  Valuation  Motilal Oswal added that the stock would be range-bound in the short term due to the high capex incurred by 5G rollout but has the potential to grow EBITDA by 40-50 percent and reduce debt by 50 percent.  Geojit said the cost-saving measures by the company and regular addition of new customers will improve performance in the near term.  Motilal Oswal has given a SOTP-based target price of Rs 1,020 -- an upside of 15 percent -- while Geojit has given a target price of Rs 954, expecting a return of 9 percent.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/bullish-on-india-business/bullish-on-india-bharti-airtel-to-win-as-india-goes-digital-5g-at-home-abroad-fuel-growth-11294521.html

The company’s African arm clocked losses due to Nigerian currency devaluation but they were offset by greater adoption of post-paid and 4G services as well as steady customer acquisition at home.  Revenue from operations for India’s second biggest telecom player rose 14.1 percent to Rs 37,440 crore from the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, Airtel said in its earnings release.  The company maintained its industry leading growth, in line with expectations.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the quarter was at Rs 19,746 crore, up 18.9 percent YoY.

Our consolidated revenue grew sequentially by 4.0 percent, and EBITDA margin expanded to 52.7 percent, underscoring the simplicity and execution of our strategy,” said Gopal Vittal, MD, Bharti Airtel.  “Our focus on winning quality customers and driving premiumization has helped us add 5.6 million new 4G customers and the highest ever postpaid customers in any one quarter. We exit the quarter with an industry leading ARPU of Rs 200. Homes, Enterprise and our digital businesses continue to exhibit strong growth momentum, reflecting the resilience and strength of our overall portfolio.”  India business  India revenue for Q1 was at Rs 26,375 crore, increased by 13.1 percent YoY. Mobile revenues grew by 12.4 percent YoY on account of improved realisation as well as strong 4G customer additions during the year. ARPU rose on the back of sustained focus on acquiring quality customers and improved realizations on account of premiumization.  Airtel said it strengthened its leadership position in the postpaid segment with the highest ever net addition of 0.8 million (Mn) in Q1 thereby reaching a customer base of 40.4 Mn.  “We continue to garner a strong share of 4G customers in the market and added 24.5 Mn 4G data customers to our network over last year, an increase of 11.9 percent YoY.

AIRTEL,2023-08-02T13:39:03+05:30,Shubham Raj,Bharti Airtel Q1 preview: Industry-leading show expected to continue,India mobile revenue growth is expected to be led by an improving mix with higher 4G and post-paid subscribers  ,"Bharti Airtel may continue reporting industry-leading growth numbers for the quarter ended June after greater adoption of post-paid and 4G services and steady customer acquisition. Businesses beyond telecom may report a mixed performance, analysts said.  In the absence of major tariff hikes in the current calendar year, the stock has delivered on-par performance, rising about 9 percent.  “We expect Airtel to report an industry-leading revenue growth of 11 percent YoY in Q1FY24, driving India mobile EBITDA growth of 17 percent,” said Kunal Vora, an analyst with BNP Paribas. “On a QoQ basis, we expect an acceleration in India mobile revenue growth to 3 percent, helped by an extra day during the quarter, an improving mix with higher 4G and post-paid subscribers and a slight impact of the increase in the price of the minimum recharge plan.”  India’s second-largest telecom company clocked a 50 percent jump in consolidated net profit to Rs 3,006 crore in the quarter ended March 2023. Sequentially, it was a surge of 89 percent. Revenue rose 14 percent to Rs 36,009 crore from Rs 31,500 crore a year ago and marginally sequentially.  Nigeria currency  Sanjesh Jain, an analyst with ICICI Securities, said his estimates suggest a “good quarter” for Bharti Airtel, aided by strong average revenue per user (ARPU) growth of 2.9 percent QoQ to Rs 199 and continued strong performance for the non-mobile segment. On a consolidated basis, Airtel Africa’s performance may be hindered by Nigerian currency devaluation, while underlying growth is likely to be healthy, he added.  Jain pegs Bharti’s consolidated EBITDA to rise 1.8 percent QoQ and 15.2 percent YoY to Rs 19,000 crore and consolidated revenue up 1.2 percent QoQ to Rs 36,400 crore.  India revenue is expected to rise 3.4 percent QoQ and 12 percent YoY to Rs 26,300 crore, led by the mobile segment. India EBITDA is likely to grow 4.6 percent QoQ and 18 percent YoY to Rs 14,000 crore, Jain said.  For Q1, brokerage house Prabhudas Lilladher has factored subscriber growth of 3 million to 338.4 million coupled with an ARPU increase of 1.4 percent QoQ to Rs 196. Home services revenue growth will be 4.2 percent QoQ and margin growth 60 bps QoQ, it said, adding that for DTH, it factored flat QoQ growth.  Accordingly, it expects Bharti’s consolidated revenue and EBITDA to increase to Rs 36,330 crore (up 0.9 percent QoQ) and Rs 18,860 crore (up 0.8 percent QoQ), respectively. The broker expects a 34 percent QoQ decrease in PAT to Rs 1,970 crore due to higher depreciation and amortisation and tax of 25.2 percent vs 15.7 percent in Q4FY23.  Africa and non-mobile  Vora said he expects YoY revenue growth for the home broadband business to be solid at 24 percent and for the enterprise business to also be in double-digits. DTH revenue should remain weak (flattish YoY).  “We expect capex to remain elevated in 1HFY24 as Airtel expands its rural 4G and urban 5G coverage. Airtel’s Africa business should be largely stable in 1QFY24 but the sharp depreciation of the Nigerian naira towards the end of Q1FY24 is likely to hurt sales and EBITDA in Q2FY24 but its impact on our valuation for Airtel is not meaningful as Airtel Africa (listed company) accounts for only 5 percent of our valuation,” Vora explained.  Since June, Nigeria has allowed its currency to fall. The naira depreciated from 471 per dollar to 870 per dollar earlier this week. This led companies in Nigeria to report exceptional non-operating losses. However, they welcomed the move for the medium to long term.  Last week, Airtel Africa posted 20 percent growth in constant currency revenue for the first quarter, with reported revenue rising almost 10 percent to $1,377 million. The net loss was $151 million.  At 1.36 pm, the share was quoting at Rs 879.35 on the National Stock Exchange, down 1.38 percent.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bharti-airtel-q1-preview-industry-leading-show-expected-to-continue-11080931.html

Vodafone Idea (Vi), which has been reeling under losses, continues to witness an outflow of users as its subscriber base declined by 28.15 lakh during May, showed the TRAI report.  Bharti Airtel, which is the closest competitor to Jio, recorded a net addition of 13.4 lakh subscribers in May, whereas, the state-run BSNL lost 14.8 lakh users.  Month-on-month, Jio's performance was flat, as it had recorded a net addition of around 30.4 lakh users in April as well. Airtel, however, recorded a spike as its net addition in April had stood at 0.7 lakh. Meanwhile, Vodafone lost 29.9 lakh users during the month.

AIRTEL,2023-07-31T11:59:37+05:30,Shubham Raj,The biggest concern for Indus Towers now: Is growth potential diminishing?,The major concern that analysts point out is if the high rate of tenancy addition is unlikely to sustain as Bharti Airtel is close to completing its rural 4G rollout and 5G rollout over the next 12 months will largely come as loading.,"Rising single tenancy and potential decrease in demand can place Indus Towers in a bind in coming periods, analysts said. The company, already facing several challenges, will likely not have an easy time going ahead either.  Analysts were largely neutral to bearish on the stock with a few exceptions. Shares of the tower leasing company traded flat for another day on July 31 at Rs 174 on BSE. The stock has not reacted much to Q1 numbers.  Sanjesh Jain, a research analyst at ICICI Securities, who downgraded the stock from ‘hold’ to ‘reduce’, underlined that the company’s Q1 numbers were good on two counts – high tenancy addition and no provisioning.  Indus Towers last week reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,348 crore for the quarter ended June 2023, an increase of 182 percent YoY. Its revenue from operations also rose 3 percent to Rs 7,076 crore from Rs 6,897 crore in the corresponding quarter last fiscal.  Quarter-on-quarter, the number of towers grew by 5,410 to 1,98,284 at June-end. Sharing revenue per tower per month was steady at Rs 73,286 while sharing revenue per sharing operator per month came in at Rs 41,503, nearly flat QoQ and YoY, and largely in line with expectations.  The major concern that analysts point out is if the high rate of tenancy addition is unlikely to sustain as Bharti Airtel is close to completing its rural 4G rollout and 5G rollout over the next 12 months will largely come as loading. Moreover, the company has seen higher single tenancy towers, which for a company that earns from providing tower sharing services, cannot be termed good.  “Rising single-tenancy towers have diluted margins and RoCE, and VIL has to significantly recover to increase visibility on rising tenancy sharing over the medium term. We see operators decelerating 5G network rollout from FY25 onwards, and tower renewals with discounts will keep average rental revenue under pressure,” said Jain.  Aliasgar Shakir, Research Analyst at Motilal Oswal also agreed with Jain’s contentions. He said with single-tenancy operations, Indus Tower may face challenges in deleveraging its debt, generating sufficient FCF, and making dividend payments.  “The company’s financials could be at risk due to a potential decline in tower leasing demand. (Moreover) Vodafone Idea’s inability to raise capital poses the risk of survival, which, in turn mars the visibility and prospects of Indus Tower,” he added.  Also read: Piramal Enterprises slumps on shrinking operating profit; analysts mixed on future outlook  Vodafone Idea has been dealing with severe cash crunch and had to dilute equity and onboard the government as the largest shareholder. The cash crunch has led to its inability to make timely payments to Indus Towers.  Jain has cut his EPS estimates for Indus Towers by 4-5 percent over FY24-25 and arrived at a target price of Rs 155. Shakir factors EBITDA growth of 50 percent and 7 percent in FY24 and FY25 on a low base on FY23, due to Vodafone write offs, arriving at target of Rs 170.  However, not everyone is as pessimistic.  Citi not just maintained its ‘buy’ rating on the counter but also raised the target price to Rs 210. It said that Q1 performance was in-line with expectations. It underlined that monthly collections from Voda Idea remain at 100 percent of billings, a big positive.

As of July 2, 2023, approximately 2,75,000 base transceiver stations (BTSs) have been deployed. In the last three months alone, they have added around 1,35,000 BTSs. However, Vi (Vodafone Idea) is facing challenges due to a paucity of funds and has fallen behind its competitors in the race to roll out 5G technology.  Nearly 50 percent of the BTSs have been added in only six states — Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh , Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat and West Bengal. Emkay Research states that, “RJio has leadership in 5G rollout, with approximately 80 percent share of the overall industry’s BTS deployment, while Airtel is being selective in its 5G BTS deployment.”  According to Emkay's analysis, Vi will only be able to launch 5G services in 10 circles across seven states using its internal accruals of approximately Rs 8300 crore. Nokia and Ericsson have refused to supply 5G equipment to Vi on credit, further worsening their funds crunch. As a result, Vi will be unable to cover all 17 of its priority circles, leading to additional market share losses in those areas. The report also highlights a steady decline in Vi's active market share over the last two years, dropping below 20 percent as of April 2023 from 25.4 percent in April 2021.  Vi is actively pursuing fundraising options, including a potential infusion of Rs 2000 crore by its promoters. However, as per Emkay Research, even if Vi manages to secure additional funding and launch 5G services in all its priority circles, it will still struggle to catch up to Airtel's current 5G rollout and will significantly lag behind Jio's 5G BTS deployment.  Emkay Research analysts maintain a &quot;Buy&quot; preference for Airtel (Target price: Rs 920) and Jio (Target price: Rs 2,750) over Vi. They expect Vi to continue to lag behind its peers in 5G rollout, citing Vi's limited flexibility to invest and its persistent subscriber losses.

AIRTEL,2023-06-30T15:47:30+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"What factors will drive market share gains, better profitability for Jio, Bharti?","The active subscriber base in the telecom sector rose by 4.2 million in April 2023 to a new high of 1,038 million, according to data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).","Continued subscriber losses by cash-strapped Vodafone Idea and 5G rollouts by Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio are expected to lead to more market share gains for these two telcos, which also bodes well for tariff hikes in the telecom sector, as per analysts.  The active subscriber base in the telecom sector rose by 4.2 million in April 2023 to a new high of 1,038 million, according to data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).  The additions were led by Jio, which gained 4.7 million subscribers. Airtel's active subscriber addition was a touch soft at 0.7 million — the lowest in the last six months.  However, VIL continued to lose subscribers, losing 0.8 million active subscribers in April 2023.  Analysts at Emkay Research said that Bharti Airtel discontinued its Rs 99 plan in November 2022 in Haryana and Odisha, followed by other circles; this may have impacted the subscriber additions for the company.  Track: Performance of telecom sector stocks  “Reported subscriber base fell by 0.8 million in Apr-23 and has been stagnant over the last years. Jio added 3 million subscribers, while Bharti (+0.1 million) reported steady subscribers. VIL continued its subscriber decline losing 3 million subscribers,” brokerage Jefferies said in a note.  VIL's 4G subscriber losses in April 2023 were the second highest in two years and this is the second time that VIL has lost 4G subscribers in the last three months.  “This suggests that 5G rollouts by Bharti and Jio are putting pressure on VIL's 4G subscriber base,” Jefferies added.  The sector's mobile number portability (MNP) requests at 11 million were lower month-on-month but still remained at elevated levels in April.  “This suggests stiff competition in the sector and focus on market share gains. Higher levels of MNP could also be due to VIL users porting out to experience 5G on Bharti or Jio. This is likely to keep churn levels elevated and drive up sales and marketing costs for telcos,” it noted.  Two-Horse Race?  Over the last four months, Jio's active subscriber additions at 16.3 million have been 3x of Bharti's 5.3 million subscriber additions. Additionally, Bharti continues to gain market share among 3G/4G subscribers.  “Jio's active subscriber leadership and Bharti's 3G/4G market share gains bode well for tariff hikes. Furthermore, VIL's 3G/4G subscriber losses indicate pressure on its 4G subscriber base and could result in accelerated market share shifts towards Jio/Bharti over the next few months,” Jefferies added.  Analysts are unanimous that the most important trigger for telcos will be tariff hikes, though the quantum and timing are hazy as of now.  Also Read: Vodafone Idea in talks with up to four PE firms to raise Rs 20,000 crore  In a post-earnings call last month, Gopal Vittal, MD and CEO, Bharti Airtel said the company is financially in a stronger place and operating cash flows are expected to more than meet capex needs while reducing leverage as well.  “Yet our concern on return on capital employed remains. At 8.5 percent, this is way too low and we hope some sense will prevail in the industry to move up tariffs sooner rather than later,” he said.  Customer Mix  Jio’s performance on the rural front also improved in April with an increase of 1.6 million, while Bharti added 0.2 million rural subscribers.  Jio continues to have the highest urban mix at 56.1 percent, followed by Bharti at 51.5 percent and VIL at 51.2 percent.  “Even as the two larger operators maintain their focus on 5G rollouts, the key trigger remains the quantum and timeline of tariff hikes. For VIL, the situation continues to be dire and a sizable fundraising is required at the earliest,” Emkay added.  Also Read: Vodafone Idea slumps after British parent values its India investment at nil  Debt-laden VIL is in advanced talks with three to four private equity funds to raise about Rs 20,000 crore, senior officials of the Department of Telecom (DoT) were informed during a recent meeting with Aditya Birla Group Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla.  A major part of the VIL’s dues to the DoT comes up for payment in FY26. Vodafone Idea has a debt of Rs 2.1 lakh crore.  The assurance from a key telco promoter assumes significance as there are concerns about an adverse impact on VIL because of the delay in raising capital. Also, without adequate capital, the company can neither start 5G services nor expand its 4G services.  Disclaimer: MoneyControl is a part of the Network18 group.

AIRTEL,2023-06-14T12:28:46+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"Delayed tariff hikes could mean more market share gains for Airtel, Jio: Analysts","Delayed tariff hikes, while negative for the sector, would hurt cash-strapped Vodafone Idea's survival hopes the most.","Rising competitive intensity in the telecom sector and several key state/general elections over the next 12 months would likely delay tariff hikes, but this can lead to accelerated market share gains for Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio at the expense of cash-strapped Vodafone Idea, analysts said.  As per TRAI data, the telecom industry’s revenue growth slowed to 9 percent y-o-y (versus 15 percent in 3Q FY23) to Rs 569 billion in March 2023, with benefits of the December 2021 tariff hikes already in the base and continued muted industry net additions.  Industry ARPU (average revenue per user) at Rs 166 was up 10 percent on-year but just 1.4 percent q-o-q as subscriber mix improvement was offset by lower days in 4Q FY23, domestic brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note.  Among private telcos, Reliance Jio was the biggest gainer in 4Q, with its Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) rising 1.7 percent q-o-q, versus 1.3 percent for Bharti Airtel and (-)1.1 percent for Vodafone Idea.  Follow our live blog for all the market action  As a result, Bharti Airtel’s market share remained flat at 36.2 percent and RJio’s market share grew 10 bps q-o-q to 41.2 percent. Vodafone Idea’s market share continued to drop by 40 bps q-o-q to 16.4 percent.  “Rising competitive intensity (RJio’s aggressive family post-paid plans and unlimited 5G data offerings) to attract higher value subscribers and several key state/general elections over the next 12 months would likely delay tariff hike to June 2024 (after general elections),” Kotak noted.  The delayed tariff hikes, while negative for the sector, would hurt Vi’s survival hopes the most (as it faces a Rs 5,500 crore cash shortfall in FY2024).  This could lead to accelerated market share gains for Bharti and RJio at Vi’s expense, it added.  Echoing the views, foreign brokerage Jefferies said any delays in tariff hikes is likely to intensify market share shifts, which in turn will benefit both Bharti and Reliance Jio.  During FY23, net mobile revenues in India grew by 14 percent YoY and rose to an all-time high of Rs 2.22 lakh crore, driven by 12 percent YoY rise in ARPU on the back of tariff hikes in Dec-21.  &quot; During FY23, while Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel accounted for 92 percent of incremental sector revenues, VIL reported a marginal increase in revenues - first increase since FY16,&quot;  Jefferies added.  Sector Standings  The subscriber base for Bharti Airtel and RJio grew 1 percent q-o-q to 371 million and 430 million respectively, while Vi posted a 2 percent drop to 237 million.  In a report, brokerage Motilal Oswal said Bharti’s earnings should soften going ahead due to moderating growth from 4G mix benefits, low probability of tariff hikes and softening market share gains.  Also Read: Reliance Jio adds 30.5 lakh mobile users in March; Vi loses 12 lakh users  “Moreover, increased capex should lead to a moderation in FCF (free cash flow) generation and the pace of deleveraging in the near term. As a result, valuations may remain under pressure,” it said, but retained its ‘Buy’ rating on the stock.  For RJio, it said overall revenue growth can soften due to a high subscriber base, continued churn, limited visibility on tariff hikes and slower market share gains. However, the long-term sector outlook remains buoyant as the market consolidation has left just two strong players, underscoring the opportunity for monetization of 5G and tariff hikes.  Vodafone Idea’s significant amount of cash required to service debt leaves limited upside opportunities for equity holders, despite the high operating leverage opportunity from any ARPU increase, it added.  “The current low EBITDA will make it challenging for VIL to service debt without an external fund infusion,” Motilal Oswal added.  Meanwhile, reports said Vodafone Idea is planning a significant capital infusion of Rs 14,000 crore, with Aditya Birla Group and UK's Vodafone Group contributing half of the amount, as part of its business revival plan.  ABG and Vodafone Group are expected to invest Rs 2,000 crore as fresh equity, on top of the Rs 5,000 crore capital already invested in the company after the telecom revival package in September 2021. They will also work to raise another Rs 7,000 crore from external investors.  &amp;nbsp;  Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

AIRTEL,2023-06-02T21:44:33+05:30,PTI,"Jio, VIL pitch for Satcom spectrum allocation through auction, Airtel opposes",Reliance Jio has submitted that spectrum assignment between space-based and terrestrial networks must maximise public good and serve the greatest number of people.,"While the satellite industry has unanimously demanded spectrum allocation through administrative methods, major telecom firms Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea, and Bharti Airtel offered divergent views to sector regulator Trai.  The comments on a consultation paper on spectrum assignment for space-based communication by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India were made public on Friday.  Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea (VIL) have suggested that the spectrum for satellite communication services should be allocated through auction, while Bharti Airtel has opposed it.  Reliance Jio has submitted that spectrum assignment between space-based and terrestrial networks must maximise public good and serve the greatest number of people.  &quot;There is no better method than free and fair auctions to achieve this goal. Auctioning spectrum is the most transparent method of spectrum assignment and allows service providers to decide on their technology, be it terrestrial, satellite, or any other,&quot; Reliance Jio said.  It also said that the Supreme Court has unambiguously declared that the right to use such spectrum can only be transferred through a transparent auction and only the Apex Court can alter this policy on spectrum assignment.  VIL said the spectrum from 27.5 GHz to 29.5 GHz (including 27.5 GHz to 28.5 GHz) should be put to a fair and transparent auction in line with the Supreme Court Judgment of 2012 and the principle of same service same rules.  Bharti Airtel said that the auction of satellite spectrum will put Indian players at a disadvantage in comparison to the global competing operators, who simply pay an administrative fee for the resources required for providing the same service in other global markets.  &quot;Airtel is concerned that auctioning the satellite spectrum and creating an exclusiveness will create barriers for competition as competitors may block access to it by bidding and winning partial or full spectrum in spite of having no such global allocation, and make satellite systems redundant and severely hamper the emerging space ecosystem in the country,&quot; it added.  The company said that the auctioning spectrum and then creating a sharing mechanism is self-defeating.  &quot;It is akin to bringing an intermediary between the spectrum licensor and user licensee: There is no need to create a middle-entity (an intermediary) between the spectrum licensor...the satellite operators,&quot; Airtel said.  It added that such an intermediary will have to initially buy the spectrum from the DoT and then, through a mandatory sharing mechanism, offer the same spectrum to actual satellite spectrum users.  &quot;This will bring in needless complexities since user satcom players will have to stitch multiple sharing arrangements together with different spectrum winners or owners,&quot; Airtel said.  Space industry body Indian Space Association (ISpA) said any step towards the auction of the spectrum for satellite services will represent a retrograde step away from fulfilling these objectives.  &quot;The features of satellite spectrum make them unsuitable for an auction process,&quot; ISpA said.

On the higher end, 18,400-18,450 is likely to act as the sturdy wall and a decisive breach would only trigger fresh longs in the system in future","A rebound in market on the last day of the week ended May 19 fuelled hopes for further rise as the Nifty50 reclaimed 18,200, the crucial level to watch out for in the current week as well as where the maximum Call and Put open interest is placed at, though the index lost six-tenth of a percent to 18,203.4 last week.  The index has maintained higher highs formation for eight sessions in a row, which is a positive sign, while the momentum indicators RSI (relative strength index 14) at 59 levels on the daily charts, indicated a positive bias, and MACD (moving average convergence divergence) on the weekly scale gave a positive crossover above zero line.  The index has formed a bearish candlestick pattern with long upper and lower shadows on the weekly charts, indicating volatility, but on Friday, there was bullish hammer kind of pattern formation on the weekly timeframe, which is a potential reversal pattern.  Hence, if the index sustains above the 18,200 mark, then 18,300-18,500 can't be ruled out in the coming days, with critical support at the psychological 18,000 mark, experts said.  &quot;The recent correction was certainly expected after the decent run and the overall chart structure remains robust, with bulls firmly able to withhold the pivotal support,&quot; Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Research at Angel One, said.  The 18,050-18,000 level was safeguarded firmly, showcasing the importance of pivotal support and is expected to act as a sheet anchor in the comparable period, he said. On the higher end, 18,400-18,450 is likely to act as the sturdy wall and a decisive breach would only trigger fresh longs in the system in future.  Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio, feels the coming week is of extreme importance for the market as it will decide the trend for the next leg. &quot;The 18,200 levels are expected to act as a strong support zone and if held in the current week, the Nifty will start moving towards 18,500-18,600 levels,&quot; he said, adding that the Nifty is trading above its 200 EMA at 17,636 indicates strength.  Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the May 19 closing prices:  Expert: Vinay Rajani, CMT, Senior Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities  Karur Vysya Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 105 | Stop-Loss: Rs 98 | Target: Rs 125 | Return: 19 percent  The stock price has broken out from the bullish “Flag” pattern on the weekly chart. Price breakout is accompanied with rising volumes.  Oscillators and indicators have turned upwards on the weekly chart. Banking and financial space has been outperforming for last couple of months and same is expected to be continue.  The stock is placed above all important moving averages, indicating bullish trend on all time frames.    Shree Digvijay Cement Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 81.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 74 | Target: Rs 95 | Return: 16 percent  The stock price has surpassed the crucial resistance of the previous swing highs on the weekly charts. It has been rising along with the rising volumes for last many weekly.  Cement sector has started outperforming recently. Indicators and oscillators have turned bullish on the weekly charts.    Ujjivan Small Finance Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 32.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 29 | Target: Rs 40 | Return: 22.5 percent  After breaking out from the “Flag” pattern on the weekly charts, the stock has now managed to surpass the previous top resistance of Rs 32.50. Primary trend of the stock is bullish as it has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms.  Short term moving averages are trading above medium to long term moving averages, which is indicating the bullish momentum in the stock. Volume spike along with price rise was registered in the last week.    Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  Reliance Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,442 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,415 | Target: Rs 2,550 | Return: 4.4 percent  In the current uptrend, the stock has followed all the technical indicators, retracements and extensions, which is the rarest part of it. After hitting Rs 2,509 level, it moved back towards Rs 2,419 level which is a support level as a Supertrend study.  After hitting the support zone, it has formed a bullish reversal formation, which can help the stock move higher towards Rs 2,550. However, till the stock does not cross the recent high of Rs 2,509 then buying should be done with a target of Rs 2,500. The stop-loss is at Rs 2,415.    Ajanta Pharma: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,301.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,200 | Target: Rs 1,550 | Return: 19 percent  Since February 2022, the stock has been consolidating between the trading range of Rs 1,130 and Rs 1,430, however, it was missing the higher bottom formation, which it has established in the last week.  Now till at least Rs 1,400, the journey to the upside would be smooth and above Rs 1,430 it will validate the formation of a double bottom.  On a weekly basis, the stock closed above the previous week's high, making it a buy candidate. Buy at Rs 1,300 and Buy at Rs 1,250, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,200. On the upside, Rs 1,400-1,430 and Rs 1,550 seem achievable.    CESC: Buy | LTP: Rs 71.7 | Stop-Loss: Rs 67 | Target: Rs 85 | Return: 18.5 percent  It is an interesting formation of the trading range. Since 2017, the stock was trading broadly between Rs 60 and Rs 85. In extreme cases, it broke out of the trading range but again returned to the same level.  Recently, in March 2023, the stock reclaimed Rs 60 levels and bounced back. In the last week, the stock closed above the highest level of the last 5 weeks.  Based on the above formation, it could move towards Rs 85 with a major hurdle at Rs 80. The strategy should be to buy in two parts, at Rs 72 and at Rs 69, with a stop-loss at Rs 67 and for targets of Rs 80 and Rs 85.    Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com  Bharti Airtel: Buy | LTP: Rs 805.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 783 | Targets: Rs 825-842 | Return: 4.5 percent  The stock has recently seen a consolidation phase which seems to be a time-wise corrective phase. However, prices have started increasing gradually and are on the verge of a breakout from the consolidation.  The 20 DEMA (exponential moving average) is acting as a support and the RSI (relative strength index) oscillator is hinting at a positive momentum.  Traders can buy this stock in the range of Rs 805-800 for potential targets of Rs 825 and Rs 842. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 783.    CESC: Buy | LTP: Rs 71.7 | Stop-Loss: Rs 68 | Targets: Rs 76-79 | Return: 10 percent  The stock prices consolidated in a range in last few weeks and formed an ‘Inverted Head and Shoulder's’ pattern. During the week gone by, the prices have given a breakout from the neckline of the pattern.  The volumes were good on the breakout and the short term momentum also seems to be bullish.  Hence, short term traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 72-71 for potential targets of Rs 76 and Rs 79. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 68.    Expert: Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio  3M India: Buy | LTP: Rs 23,911.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 23,500 | Target: Rs 24,600 | Return: 3 percent  The stock has seen breaking out of a downwards sloping trendline on the weekly timeframe with a bullish candlestick, whereas the supertrend indicator is also indicating a bullish continuation trend which can be used as a confluence towards the bullish view.

As expected (recent report), capex rose 23% QoQ to INR114b, leading to moderation in FCF and deleveraging.  In the near term, we believe earnings growth is expected to remain soft due to slow market share gain, limited tariff hikes and moderating 4G mix benefits. Moreover, higher capex for the 5G rollout and rural coverage could lead to moderate FCF generation. As a result, we believe the stock could remain range-bound in the near term. However, the company is well poised to benefit from sectoral tailwinds for the next two years (EBITDA CAGR of 12% over FY23-25E). Reiterate our BUY rating on the stock.  Outlook We value BHARTI at INR950 based on SoTP, assigning an EV/EBITDA ratio of 10x/5x to the India Mobile/Africa businesses. Retain BUY on the stock.

The heavy-lifting on most investments is behind except for 5G network rollout.

However, capex accelerated &amp;gt;50% YoY to INR93b, and the FCF declined to INR33b with slower pace of deleveraging. In the near term, the stock should see an overhang with moderate FCF generation, due to softening earnings. This was a result of slower 4G adds, limited tariff hikes and increased capex intensity toward 5G rollout and rural coverage. However, over the next two years, the company is well poised to gain from sector tailwinds, with EBITDA CAGR of 13% over FY23- 25E, driven by a combination of a) market share gains b) improved ARPU, led by premiumization of customers and tariff hikes and c) non-Wireless segments. We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock.  Outlook We value BHARTI on a FY25E basis, assigning an EV/EBITDA ratio of 11/5 to the India Mobile/Africa business, and arriving at a SoTP-based TP of INR985.

It had a validity of 28 days. Airtel began scrapping the plan since November last year.  With the Rs 99-plan being chalked out, users will have to buy an entry-level unlimited calling pack of Rs 155.

Customer can now use this plan with no constraints. We believe this plan will prove greater flexibility, convenience and superior value,&quot; an Airtel spokesperson said.  The fallout of the move, for Airtel customers who recharged with the Rs 99-pack, would be that they would have to shell out 57 percent more on monthly basis. For the company, however, this would result in an increase in the average revenue per user (ARPU).  According to Morgan Stanley, Airtel's higher minimum recharge plans &quot;could eventually be rolled out pan-India over the coming months&quot;, and could lead to an estimated revenue accretive of &quot;1.3-1.5 percent&quot;.  The company, which is India's second largest telecom player, reported total subscriber base for its countrywide mobile business of 328 million as of September 2022, out of which non-data subscribers were at 109 million, the investment banking firm said in a report.  &quot;Out of this bucket, we estimate roughly 33.40 million could be sitting on the minimum recharge plans, with potential ARPU of Rs 95.

Airtel owns 70% in the unit, with the balance held by Bharti Enterprises. ","Telecom giant, Bharti Airtel is planning to list its unit, Airtel Payments Bank, according to a report by Economic Times. The company’s data centre business could also be monetized at some stage, it added.  The official, quoted in the report said, “Airtel is not looking at a premium pricing for its 5G services, which is being rolled out at a rapid pace, the telco doesn’t need the 700 MHz band in the future as well for its next gen services.”  Also Read: Bharti Airtel plans Rs 27,000-28,000 crore capex for network, no premium pricing for 5G  He added that currently, only 12% of the devices support 5G in India and that significant revenue opportunities from captive networks were still sometime away, with use cases still being developed and trialled.  Earlier this year, Airtel Payments Bank got categorised as a scheduled bank by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the second schedule of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.  Launched in January 2017, Airtel Payments Bank currently has around 50 million users on the platform and about Rs 20,000 crore in gross merchandise value (GMV), with annualised revenue at around Rs 1,000 crore. Airtel owns 70% in the unit, with the balance held by Bharti Enterprises.  “It’s (Airtel Payments Bank) a profitable company, it’s doing well and growing rapidly. Further, that’s an option as per the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) license that at some stage we are expected to list,” the official said.  Speaking about the data consumption on 5G, the official said it’s too early to come to any conclusions as the network rollout is at a nascent stage. “But by February, we can have a fair idea about data consumption and can share some colour on it in the Q4 results,” the official said.  Currently, about 20% of the revenues come from enterprise but in the coming few years, the company is targeting surpassing global telcos which on average get 22-23% of their revenue from the business.  “Currently, the enterprise market is around Rs 45,000 crore but there is an adjacent market worth Rs 50,000 crore, which is yet to be tapped,” the official said.  Airtel is betting big on its home business to improve its average revenue per user (ARPU), which stood at Rs 190 in the fiscal second quarter ended September.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/bharti-airtel-plans-to-list-airtel-payments-bank-report-9779191.html
AIRTEL,2022-12-28T18:37:30+05:30,PTI,"Bharti Airtel plans Rs 27,000-28,000 crore capex for network, no premium pricing for 5G","According to data shared by the telecom ministry, Bharti Airtel has rolled out 3,293 base stations for 5G till November 26.  ","Telecom operator Bharti Airtel has plans to invest Rs 27,000-28,000 crore in telecom network with a focus on 5G rollout, a company official said on Wednesday.  While the company is planning to increase capital expenditure by 10-15 per cent, it has no plans to charge a premium rate for 5G services as it has not worked in several countries that tried to do so.  &quot;Airtel capex will be in line with that spent in the last three years. It may go up and down because of the faster rollout of 5G– around Rs 27,000-28,000 crore. We may see an upsurge in one year and gradually moderate around the same level,&quot; the official, who did not wish to be named, told PTI.  The company earlier had an annual average capex in the range of Rs 24,000-25,000 crore. The official said that capex is being largely spent on radios (mobile antennas), fibre, broadband, enterprise technology data centres, etc.  According to data shared by the telecom ministry, Bharti Airtel has rolled out 3,293 base stations for 5G till November 26.  The official said that the company hopes mobile services rates to go up but the range of increase will depend on market dynamics.  Bharti Airtel has increased the price of its minimum recharge for 28 days mobile phone service plan by about 57 per cent to Rs 155 in Haryana and Odisha. The company has stopped its minimum recharge plan of Rs 99, under which it offered 200 megabytes of data and calls at the rate of Rs 2.5 paise per second.  In Haryana and Odisha, Airtel has now started offering the Rs 155 plan with unlimited calling, 1 GB data and 300 SMSes. The officer said that the response of the pilot run of the new tariff has been good and churn has been much lower than expected.  He said that in the next six weeks the company will have a full idea of the pilot and take calls on its rollout in other telecom circles. When asked whether Airtel will look at charging a premium for 5G services, the official said that the premium price for 5G has not worked anywhere in the world and the company is also not interested in charging higher for the 5G services.  He said that the company sees a lot of business coming from consumers shifting from 2G to 4G, pre-paid to postpaid and postpaid customers buying all of Airtel's services like broadband, direct-to-home etc.  &quot;When Airtel's 2G customers switch to 4G they double ARPU (average revenue per user). When a pre-paid customer converts to post-paid, ARPU further doubles and when a post-paid customer buys all home services-broadband etc, then APRU quadruples. There is a lot of business that can come from these upgrades,&quot; the officer said.  The Average Revenue Per User or ARPU (a key metric for telcos) stood at Rs 190 for the July-September 2022 quarter, compared to Rs 153 in the same period a year ago with a focus on quality customers, feature phone to smartphone upgradation, and data monetisation.  Bharti Airtel is also looking at increasing revenue from new business verticals around cloud services, cyber security, communications platform-as-a-service etc which it estimates to be a Rs 50,000 crore market.  &quot;Airtel enterprise business is very strong. The opportunities are massive. We play in the Rs 45,000 crore market but there is an adjacent market which is Rs 50,000 crore. These are things like communications platforms as a service (CPaas), cyber security, and cloud. These are things where we are putting a lot of energy behind,&quot; the officer said.  Airtel's 80 per cent of the enterprise segment revenue comes from 20 per cent of the customer.  The company is now working to reach out to new customers with an entire suite of offerings including solutions for adjacency services.  &quot;With our focus adjacencies, we will reach out to customers who are with us but not availing cloud, cyber security, CPaas services. We will also go to those enterprises who are not with us with an entire suite of solutions. There are massive growth opportunities in the enterprise. We will use 5G as one of the products to reach out to enterprises,&quot; the officer said.  Bharti Airtel has become the first telecom operator to roll out a private 5G-based network for an enterprise in the country.  The company has deployed a 5G-based captive private network at Mahindra's Chakan manufacturing facility in partnership with IT firm Tech Mahindra.  The official denied any plan for buying spectrum in the premium 700 megahertz band which its rival Jio has acquired in the last auction. The officer said that AIrtel has sufficient spectrum in the 850 and 900 megahertz bands to support 5G services.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/bharti-airtel-plans-rs-27000-28000-crore-capex-for-network-no-premium-pricing-for-5g-9777541.html

The decline is mainly due to an expanded base and slowing of export revenue amid fears of a recession that could affect demand. However, the performance of the energy sector, which is closely linked to crude oil prices, will hold the key, said Mayuresh Joshi, head of equity research at William O’Neil &amp;amp; Co. Controlled inflation, a peaked out bad-loan cycle and good agricultural output will lend some support to the Nifty 50, said G Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics Research. Bajaj Finserv, Bharti Airtel, Axis Bank, Adani Enterprises and Tata Motors are likely to be the biggest contributors to EPS growth in the Nifty 50 index in FY24, according to a Moneycontrol analysis. A real turnaround in EPS growth is expected in Axis Bank and Tata Motors, according to Bloomberg data. On the other hand, EPS growth is narrowing for Bharti Airtel and Adani Enterprises.  How the valuations stack up: According to Bloomberg, the Nifty Index’s PE is expected to contract to 19.2 times in FY24 from 22.9 times in FY23 mainly on account of higher earnings for the next financial year.  According to Gautam Duggad, head of research – institutional equities at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, the Nifty price to earnings for the next 12 months at 20x is well within the 10-year average of 19.6 times because earnings have caught up while the markets were little changed for the past 12 months. With earnings growth of 16-17 percent for FY24, the markets should, by and large, reflect underlying earnings without much de-rating/re-rating. On a granular basis, Axis Bank and Adani Enterprises are trading at higher valuations than their 10-year average, while Bharti Airtel, ONGC and Tata Motors are trading at steeper discounts.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/which-stocks-will-drive-the-nifty-50-from-here-9603051.html

AIRTEL,2022-11-15T11:11:42+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Running 5G speed tests may deplete your data plan,A test run to check your speeds can potentially deplete half of your daily usage limit,"With 5G now rolling out to metro cities across India, users are slowly discovering that high-speed internet comes with some grave consequences.  As reported by The Economic Times, social media platforms like Twitter are full of posts with Indian users claiming that they ran out of data after running a few routine speed tests.  In some cases, the high-data consumption can total up to 700 - 800MB per test run, which is usually half of the allotted data limit on most mobile plans.  This is the case during normal operations, too, for example - 10 minutes of browsing Instagram using 5G consumes about 207MB of data, whereas with 4G, it consumes 120MB of data.  The reason for this is that apps usually switch to high-quality content in areas with good 5G coverage, making file sizes larger, which eats into your allocated daily limits faster.  An anonymous industry executive told The Economic Times that once metaverse apps, cloud gaming, 4K streaming and 8K streaming start to become commonplace, we will only see the data consumption go up.  A typical speed test for 5G networks in Delhi reveals download speeds of up to 800Mbps depending on coverage. Unfortunately, this also means you will be consuming around 1GB of data in less than a minute.  Jio is offering unlimited data with a minimum recharge of Rs 230 under its beta trials but there is no word yet on what the final data plans will be like. Airtel users on the other hand are stuck with daily data limits for usage.  Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a telecoms industry executive told The Economic Times: &quot;Carriers expect data usage to rise at least 2.5 times, if not more, to roughly 40-50GB once they start becoming a 5G consumer&quot;.  According to a 2021 report by OpenSignal, data consumption in areas where 5G networks operate at a larger scale (US, South Korea) have already seen a rise in data consumed of 2.7 times compared to 4G. In Taiwan, subscribers use up as much as 47.3GB of data per month.  (Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Additionally, the government is expected to lead in developing the India stack, a network building process that would cover every segment of the economy being digitised with the latest advanced technologies, he told PTI at the Singapore Fintech Festival last week, held from November 2-4, 2022.  &quot;This is a big play,&quot; he said of the advanced technologies adoption in India, with IBM Consulting joining international technology groups participating in the large-scale development over several years through strategic partnerships with telcos such as Bharti Airtel and Reliance Group.  &quot;We plan to work with Indian telcos, where we have strategic partnerships like Bharti Airtel to bring secured hybrid cloud services through the 5G network to national enterprises. The agreement with Bharti Airtel is there to launch it,&quot; said Shahid, the Singapore-based IBM executive.  &quot;For this, both the parties will have to spend billions of dollars. Huge amount of money is being spent by the stakeholders in this ongoing process and it will take over a couple of years,&quot; he underlined.  &quot;We are particularly working on securing hybrid cloud services through the 5G network.&quot; Hybrid cloud is a major shift in the evolution of enterprise IT.  The next big thing is to create India stack for different sectors of the Indian economy, he pointed out.  India stack is a set of APIs that allows governments, businesses, startups and developers to utilise a unique digital infrastructure to solve India's hard problems towards presence-less, paperless and cashless service delivery.  Shahid says the government is to lead the India stack and incentivise banks and other stakeholders in the ecosystem for the benefits of consumers.  India has some 800 million mobile phone users and the number is growing, forming the base for the fast growing digital economy.  On project basis, Shahid said IBM and Bank of Baroda will expand the 'Baroda Kisan' app, a one-stop shop for all the needs of the agriculture and farming community. It was launched in September 2019.  Agriculture sector is a high priority area of development for the government which is committed to raising the income of farmers in the coming years.  All the banks know that the traditional banking services will be different in four to five years down the line, he pointed out.  Farmers, for example, will go to the platform which provides end-to-end services for the agriculture industry.  &quot;We are trying to get all the stakeholders, on the three-year old Baroda Kisan platform, such as suppliers of fertilizers. With these stakeholders on board, price discovery can be better and farmers can go and buy from the best supplier,&quot; said the IIM Ahmedabad alumni.  In the future, the farmers' needs will be on apps and metaverse, making it easier and efficient to source services and supplies, even farm equipment.  Another successful startup partnership by IBM in India is the SBI YONO (You Only Need One) app, valued at USD 40 billion.  YONO gives SBI an enormous market advantage, combining services, products and features into one mobile app with a platform that could integrate data across third-party products and streamline the customer experience.  &quot;These are two of the most successful startups by IBM and partners in India,&quot; said Shahid who has spent the first 15 years of his over 20 years' experience working in India.

During the company's earnings call, Bharti Airtel Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Gopal Vittal said Apple will release the software update in the first week of November and all of its devices should support the company's 5G services by mid-December.  Airtel is providing 5G services at 4G rates but it is likely to take call on the pricing of the next generation services in the next 6-9 months, he added.  &quot;Samsung... I think there are 27 models of 5G. 16 models are already ready and enabled. Rest will happen by November 10-12. OnePlus all 17 models will work on our network.

They will have (software update) release around the first week of November and by mid-December they should be all ready,&quot; Vittal said.  According to market research firm IDC, 5.1 crore 5G smartphones were shipped from 2020 to first half of 2022 and they are expected to cross 50 per cent market share by 2023.  However, several 5G smartphones have been unable to access 5G services due to lack of compatibility between the network and the mobile phone.  Vittal said the company expects to cover all towns in urban India as also key rural areas by March 2024.  He said the company is in the 5G network construction phase and &quot;then we take decision as to what we do, may be, in next 6-9 months.&quot; &quot;As the network starts getting built out we will see a significant part of our existing data traffic on 4G move to Airtel 5G plus. This is important since it will allow us to gradually move more and more spectrum to 5G at the flick of a button. We have also started testing the SA (standalone) mode on 5G. This mode may be relevant for some enterprise use cases,&quot; he said.  Bharti Airtel may advance earmarked network investment of Rs 23,000-24,000 crore per annum to expedite rollout of 5G services and gain market share.  Without naming debt-ridden Vodafone Idea, Vittal said, &quot;Given the financially pressed situation that one of the players in the Industry is going through, we feel that the moment is ripe for Airtel pulling ahead and being the decisively most aspirational brand in India. With this we hope to take a further lead particularly in the postpaid segment.&quot;  Bharti Airtel has posted an 89 per cent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit for the September quarter at Rs 2,145 crore, as higher revenue per user, more data consumption, and expanded 4G base boosted realisations.  Airtel's total revenue rose nearly 22 per cent year-on-year to Rs 34,527 crore during the just-ended quarter.  The company attributed this to &quot;strong and consistent performance delivery across the portfolio and crossing 500 million customers globally&quot;.  The Q2 net profit trailed street expectations, though the revenue numbers came in higher than market estimates.  The Average Revenue Per User or ARPU (a key metrics for telcos) stood at Rs 190 for the just-ended quarter as compared to Rs 153 in Q2 FY22, helped by focus on quality customers, feature phone to smartphone upgradation and data monetisation, Airtel said.  Vittal said that the company has only 8.5 per cent return on investments which is very low and can be achieved by investing in financial instruments.  &quot;This return on capital needs to go up. We are not talking about massive corrections. We are already at Rs 190 ARPU. We need to see one round of correction. When this will happen I am not at liberty to say.

AIRTEL,2022-10-31T08:36:27+05:30,Shubham Raj,Bharti Airtel Q2 Preview | Strong profit growth likely but ARPU may stay flat,ARPU growth for telecom companies have slowed down as all impact of tariff hike taken in the previous year has been reflected in the numbers. Analysts and market participants are waiting for the next round of tariff hikes now  ,"India’s second largest telecom company Bharti Airtel is likely to report strong earnings for the September quarter later today.  The company will likely report a 75 to 110 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in net profit for the quarter, while its revenue growth is expected around 20 percent. The company's operating profit margin is likely to expand over the last year but contract sequentially.  “Indian wireless revenues are expected to see 2.5 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth at Rs 18,621 crore. India non-wireless revenues traction are expected to remain robust, especially broadband and enterprise,” ICICIdirect said. “We expect India EBITDA margins at 51.9 percent, up 80 bps QoQ, aided by partial benefit of lower spectrum usage charge.”  The brokerage house expects a reported average revenue per user (ARPU), an important metric to gauge efficiency of telecom business, to rise 2 percent on-quarter at Rs 187 with benefits of subscriber mix and higher number of days during the quarter.  Last week, Airtel Africa reported a 17.2 percent decline in net profit to $133 million in the quarter ended September 2022 on an annual basis. The latest hit was due to higher foreign exchange rates and derivative losses, the company said.  Emkay Global expects Airtel’s APRU to grow 1 percent on-quarter, which is similar to what Reliance Jio reported earlier in the month. Jio reported an ARPU of Rs 177.2, growing 0.8 percent sequentially.  ARPU growth for telecom companies have slowed down as all impact of tariff hike taken in the previous year has been reflected in the numbers. Analysts and market participants are waiting for the next round of tariff hikes now.  Reliance Jio Q2 Result | Net profit rises 28% YoY, ARPU grows 23.5% to Rs 177.2  The India mobility segment for Airtel is likely to grow at 1 percent QoQ, Emkay said, adding that on the non-mobility front, the homes and enterprise segments are likely to report a steady growth of 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively, while DTH would decline by another 0.4 percent QoQ.  Analysts across the spectrum expect a modest addition of 2 million subscribers during the quarter. In comparison, Reliance Jio has been adding subscribers at a relatively faster rate. In Q2, for the connectivity business, the net subscriber addition was at 7.7 million for Jiio. Gross additions were at 32.7 million.  Yes Securities also said that Airtel’s earnings are likely to stand higher YoY and QoQ primarily on improvement in ARPU and due to continued addition in the 4G subscriber base.  Analysts said management commentary on the ARPU trajectory and non-wireless business will be key things to watch out for.

AIRTEL,2022-10-10T08:51:24+05:30,Sunil Matkar," MC Interview | Real up-move yet to be seen in Bharti Airtel, Nifty Midcap aims for 35,000, says this...","The vice-president of research and head of technical and derivatives at Axis Securities with over 20 years of professional experience in the financial services industry believes the Nifty Midcap 100 will hit 35,000 mark","Bharti Airtel is on a strong foothold as the stock has been trading at around the upper zone of band Bollinger but the real move is yet to be seen, says Rajesh Palviya of Axis Securities.  The Airtel price move is currently getting rejected near upper band and retraces back to neckline and takes support to rebound, he adds.  The vice-president of research and head of technical and derivatives at Axis Securities with over 20 years of professional experience in the financial services industry believes the Nifty Midcap 100 will hit 35,000 mark.  &quot;Technically apart from trading above the important 200 DMA (daily moving average) and other momentum oscillators - volume indicators, if we draw retracement from the recent high-low then the first target comes at 35,000 and sustain above the same then the next target comes at 37,000,&quot; he shares in an interview to Moneycontrol.  Excerpts from the interview:  The market has not been getting enough strength to get back to 18,000 mark. Do you see any possibility of the market getting back to 16,000 mark in the short term, though there seems to be positive trend in medium term?  Global markets witnessed a sell-off as monthly non-farm payrolls data stronger-than-expected subdued hopes of a Fed pivot, and shifted investor focus to the prospect of another jumbo-sized rate hike next month will lead to a recession. In the very near term, there are uncertainties around US inflation, interest rates, recession in large economies and commodity prices. Developments around these factors will keep markets volatile.  The  Nifty had last week witnessed a strong rebound from 100-day SMA (simple moving average - 16,727) and reclaimed the 17,000 psychological mark on a closing basis. Index has ended its corrective phase at around 50 percent Fibonacci retracement (16,640) of prior up-move (15,183-18,096).  Though market move is getting rejected in short term on the higher zone but on the downside also market is holding with strength near 16,800 – 17,000 zone &amp;amp; until we don't drawdown below 16,800 mark lower side level are unlikely to be tested.  Market may witness major unwinding action below 16,800, while on the other hand if we manage to close above 17,450 level we may see a strike through 18,000 mark again. The weekly strength indicator RSI (relative strength index) is at the verge of crossover above its reference line indicating trend may change to positive.  The IT index has seen two strong gap-up openings in the start of the current month after falling closer to the 26,000 mark. Do you think the sector has bottomed out and gradually preparing ground to make a big move in the coming months?  In an aggressive rate hike by the US Federal Reserve scenario, the rupee will have weakening bias against USD. We have seen in the past that in times of currency depreciation, export-oriented sector like IT stand out in terms of price performance relative to market but in near term fear of recession in large economies IT sector is in defensive in nature and market attributing benefits of currency depreciation to earnings.  Ideally, the IT sector index on falling back towards 26,000 zone has marked a kind of double bottom level on the lower side and have rebounded back towards 28,000 levels. If we sense slightly on the broader scale we think reclaim above 28,000 zone can confirm sector is bottoming out &amp;amp; we may see an move towards 29,500 – 30,000 levels.  As per technical charts, do you see the Indian rupee weakening towards 85 against the US dollar soon?  On the monthly chart, prices have consecutively closed in positive for the last nine months and historically similar moves happened from February 2018 to October 2018 where the pair rallied from 65.30 to 74.50 almost a 17 percent rise.  The pair have rallied from a low of 74.30 (February 2022) - up 11 percent to the current price of 82.82. So if according to the technical theory of “history repeats itself” we could see prices rallying further 6 percent which comes around 86.50, which also coincides with the Fibonacci extension levels of 161.80 percent (drawn using three reference points low 68.28, high 77.01 and low 72.26) which stands at 86.60.  For the above observation we can say the pair could test 85 levels on the charts but the time horizon could be a few weeks or may be months to come. However if USDINR breaks below 81.50 then it may correct further towards 81.20- 80.55 levels.  Do you think Bharti Airtel is on a strong footing now as it has largely been trading in the upper Bollinger Band since August?  Bharti Airtel is on a strong foothold as stock has been trading at around upper zone of band Bollinger but the real move is still to be seen into the stock. If we keenly observe price move is currently getting rejected near upper band &amp;amp; retraces back to neckline and take support to rebound.  The stock has retraced from the upper band and is trading near the support zone (neckline) of Rs 780. Going ahead, if we close below Rs 770, then we may reclaim lower band Bollinger zone which is place near Rs 740 zone. While if support holds, we may see an strong rebound and probable move above Rs 800 will confirm the outbreak of upper band Bollinger zone in short term and we can see rally towards Rs 840-860 in short term.  After a year-long consolidation, is the Nifty Midcap 100 index ready to hit 35,000 mark by end of current financial year?  The Nifty Midcap has made a strong bullish monthly chart and is currently trading almost near 4-month high augmented with momentum oscillator RSI above 60 levels and increasing volumes indicating overall uptrend in index along with positive bias to continue.  So, to answer the question whether Nifty Midcap 100 will hit 35000 mark, the answer is yes. Technically, apart from trading above the important 200 DMA (daily moving average) and other momentum oscillators - volume indicators, if we draw retracement from the recent high-low then the first target comes at 35,000 &amp;amp; sustain above the same then the next target comes at 37,000.  However any close below 27,800 – 27,700 on monthly chart will be a negative signal for the current trend and will negate the above view.  After taking multiple supports above 12,000 mark, do you think Nifty Pharma has enough strength now to surpass 14,000 by calendar year-end?  The Nifty pharma is showing buying interest at lower levels and managed to give breakout of last four-month consolidation range breakout.  Pharma index managed to give breakout of falling trend line on weekly chart indicates trend reversal. Chart pattern indicates if Pharma index manages to hold above 12,800-12,700 levels then it may scale up towards 13,500-14,000 levels in coming months.

AIRTEL,2022-10-03T10:18:38+05:30,Sunil Shankar Matkar,Top 10 trading ideas for next 3-4 weeks as market melts in bear hug,"If the Nifty50 holds current levels and surpasses 17,200-17,300 in coming sessions, then 17,500 can be a possible target with crucial support at 17,000 followed by 16,800-16,750 levels","The market saw a relief rally of nearly 2 percent on Friday, taking support at 16,750, after consistent selling in previous seven consecutive sessions and looking oversold. This rally, on a weekly basis, helped the Nifty50 trim losses to little more than one percent, continuing downtrend for third straight week.  The index decisively gave a close above 17,000 mark as well as 200-day SMA (around 16,990). It has formed bullish Engulfing candlestick pattern on the daily charts and there was Hammer kind of pattern formation on the weekly scale at downtrend, indicating bullish reversal pattern.  Hence, if the index holds current levels and surpasses 17,200-17,300 in coming sessions, then 17,500 can be a possible target with crucial support at 17,000 followed by 16,800-16,750 levels, experts said.  &quot;A move beyond 17,200 on a closing basis would strengthen the recovery rally. In this case, 17,350 – 17,500 levels cannot be ruled out. On the flipside, 16,900–16,750 has now become a sacrosanct support zone,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One said.  The market expert advised traders to keep a close tab on global developments and any favourable cues on this front would provide the much-needed push to the domestic markets.  Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the September 30 closing prices:  Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities  ACC: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,415.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,313 | Target: Rs 2,785 | Return: 15 percent  After a higher level of reversal (i.e. from Rs 2,785 to Rs 2,313), the stock formed a bullish reversal pattern - Morning Doji Star around its extended horizontal breakout line and poised for a fresh up-move. This could take the stock towards its life-time-high in the short-term.  The key technical indicators tested the oversold zone on short-term timeframe chart and on the verge of a bullish cross-over. A follow-up move will confirm the bullish reversal and support probable rise in the stock.  In case of any decline, the stock will find support around its recent swing low.    Persistent Systems: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,241 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,092 | Target: Rs 3,923 | Return: 21 percent  The stock remained sideways after a trendline breakout, where volume was above average. This signals that bulls are gradually taking control, which will support a strong rise. Its daily RSI (relative strength index) and MACD (moving average convergence and divergence) are positively poised after a bullish cross-over.  We believe the stock will rebound utilising prior consolidation and could move towards its prior swing high. In case of any decline, the stock will find support around its lower band of the range.    Muthoot Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,040 | Stop-Loss: Rs 950 | Target: Rs 1,214 | Return: 17 percent  The stock recovered from its 52-week low and breached its prior weekly falling trend. Rise in volume and bullish formation signals that major market participants are in favor of the bulls. The stock has potential to move towards its highest level of August 2022 in the short-term.  The key technical indicators reversed from the oversold zone and gave buy signal. As per the current set-up, the stock will soon resume its northward journey and could give desired action.  On the lower side, the stock will find support around its 52-week low.    Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail), Kotak Securities Ltd  Aegis Logistics: Buy | LTP: Rs 271.1 | Stop-Loss: Rs 254 | Target: Rs 300 | Return: 11 percent  The stock is forming a rounding bottom formation, which is visible on the daily chart if we consider the price action from June 2021 to date. Normally, we see a gradual rally in the stock, which takes time to reach the final target.  The starting point of the formation is Rs 387.90 which should be its ultimate target in the coming few months. However, in the near term, we can expect the stock to move towards the 300 level, which is the upper limit of the current consolidation.  Buy partly at current levels and balance at Rs 260, with a stop-loss at Rs 254.    GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals: Buy | LTP: Rs 1424.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,370 | Target: Rs 1,500-1,575 | Return: 5-10 percent  The stock has taken support at Rs 1,370 several times since June 2020 which means that the level of Rs 1,370 has some fundamental significance. After hitting the Rs 1370 level, it jumps up to Rs 1,700, which is a decent upside.  For two months, the stock remained above Rs 1,370 level and bounced back repeatedly. Volume indicators and sectoral performance are also supporting the price action.  It is advisable to buy between Rs 1,430 and Rs 1,400. Place the last stop-loss at Rs 1,370 based on the closing. On the other hand, it might rally to Rs 1,500-1,575 in the next few weeks.    Trent: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,420 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,350 | Target: Rs 1,500-1,600 | Return: 6-13 percent  It is consolidating above the breakout level, which was at Rs 1,350. It is a symmetrical triangle formation and on September 27, it has taken the support of the rising trend line of the triangle formation.  Based on it we can expect a minimum target of Rs 1,500 and a maximum of Rs 1,600 in the short term (few weeks). In the longer term, we are targeting Rs 1,700-1,800 level. Buying at current levels is advisable but with a stop-loss of Rs 1,350.    Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst, HDFC Securities  Federal Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 118.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 112 | Target: Rs 132 | Return: 11 percent  Federal Bank has corrected from a high of Rs 129.75 touched in early September 2022. The stock recently found support around Rs 109 levels which is close to the 50 days SMA (simple moving average). The stock subsequently bounced back sharply on Friday and closed above the 20 days SMA.  The bounce back came on the back of healthy volumes which is encouraging. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI too have bounced back and are in rising mode now.  With the intermediate technical setup too looking positive, we believe the stock has the potential to move higher in the coming weeks. Recommend a buy between Rs 117-120 levels. Stop-loss is at Rs 112 while target is at Rs 132.  Dixon Technologies: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,371.6 | Stop-loss: Rs 4,110 | Target: Rs 4,900 | Return: 12 percent  After correcting from a high of Rs 6,244 in October 2021, Dixon found support around Rs 3180 levels in May 2022. These are strong supports as the stock has found support around these same levels in the past. Recently, the stock reversed its downtrend by crossing its previous swing high of Rs 4,020.  Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50 days SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.  With the intermediate setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 4,350-4,440 levels. Stop-loss is at Rs 4,110 while target is at Rs 4,900.    Sun TV Network: Buy | LTP: Rs 508.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 495 | Target: Rs 535 | Return: 5 percent  Sun TV has corrected from a high of Rs 538 touched in mid-September 2022. The stock recently found support around Rs 486 levels which is close to the 50 days SMA. The stock subsequently bounced back smartly on Friday and closed just below the 20 days SMA.  The bounce back came on the back of healthy volumes which is encouraging. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI too have bounced back and are in rising mode now.

Aditya Birla Group Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla on Saturday pledged the telco’s commitment to taking India on ”the new pace of country’s digital journey” while speaking at the inauguration of India Mobile Congress 2022 and launch of 5G services in the country by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ”We will soon begin 5G rollout journey. We will leverage our strong presence in rural India, our enterprise customers, our tech partners, and global experience of Vodafone Group for progressively rolling out our 5G network and services in the coming period,” Birla said. Unlike its rivals Reliance Jio and Airtel that outlined firm timelines for the launch of 5G services, Vodafone Idea did not disclose any rollout schedule or timeframe. Bharti Airtel’s 5G service will be available in eight cities from Saturday, its chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said at the event. Mittal also said Airtel will roll out 5G services in several cities across the country by March 2023 and across India by March 2024. Reliance Jio, the nation’s biggest telecom firm, will expand 5G telephony services offering ultra high-speed internet connectivity to every part of the country by December 2023, Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani said at the mega telecom event. Financial pressure has been mounting on cash-strapped Vodafone Idea, despite opting to convert about Rs 16,000 crore of interest liability payable to the government into equity. Mobile tower giant Indus Towers is learnt to have asked debt-ridden Vodafone Idea to clear outstanding dues and pay on time every month for continuity of business post-November. According to sources, American Tower Corporation (ATC), which has 75,000 mobile towers in India, is also mulling steps to secure its dues. ”We have 240 million people connected to our networks with 50 per cent of them in rural India.

Having taken concrete steps for 5G ecosystem development, 5G use case for Indian enterprises and consumers and acquisition of 5G spectrum in well designed auction, we will soon begin the 5G roll out journey,” Birla said. He said critical policy interventions by the government in the telecom space had boosted investor confidence, and hoped that the sector will continue to receive policy support. The Aditya Birla Group top honcho termed 5G as a ”generational leap in technology”, one that demonstrates India’s prowess on the global stage and reinforces telecom industry’s role as bedrock of Digital India. Telecom industry has been among the country’s key growth engines, catapulting India into the top five economies of the world. It continues to play a transformational role touching every aspect of daily lives and work, Birla said. ”Today we are set to make a giant leap into the future, driven by reformist and futuristic policies of our PM, we are committed to the vision of building digital infrastructure for India of tomorrow,” he said. On Saturday, VIL also showcased a 5G use case and demonstrated how technology can be leveraged for ensuring worker safety and efficiency in critical construction sites. With the launch of 5G networks, the telecom industry will further ignite the digital dreams of 1.3 billion Indians and many thousands of enterprises, Birla said. ”It will also set the stage for the country to become 5 trillion dollar economy in the next few years with trillion dollar contribution by digital economy itself. 5G will augment services at scale and create impact in critical areas like industries 4.0, automated manufacturing, to creating connected factories, smart cities, smart homes, immersive gaming and other innovative business and consumer solutions,” Birla noted. The 5G era will also accelerate immersive education, remote health and smart agriculture to enable inclusive growth and prosperity in rural India.  The launch of 5G services marks the start of an exciting journey for India, he said, adding as the ecosystem evolves, it will unleash limitless potential for 5G development and use cases in years to come. ”The telecom industry will certainly play its roles in bringing alive his (Prime Minister’s) vision for Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India),” he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/voda-idea-says-its-5g-rollout-journey-will-begin-soon-doesnt-specify-launch-coverage-timelines-9261981.html

After the deal, Singtel/Mittal family would hold 29.7%/25.6% in Airtel and both groups will work towards equalising their stake over time. &quot;With Singtel’s selling entities domiciled in Mauritius, there are no capital gains tax implications and hence we expect the transaction to happen off-market,&quot; said IIFL Securities in a note to investors.  On a conference call, Singtel ruled out any equity infusion in BTL. &quot;BTL thus has to raise debt to fund this $1.6 billion transaction but we believe that rising dividend payouts from Airtel should keep BTL’s debt in check. Airtel remains our top pick as it is well placed to benefit from continued RMS gains and tariff hikes,&quot; IIFL Securities added.  &quot;Singtel would use the deal proceeds to fuel its 5G capex and future growth initiatives.

We forecast the company’s EBITDA would report a 23% CAGR over FY2022-FY2024E on the back of strong revenue growth, potential tariff hike, steady increase in 4G subscribers, and a higher postpaid subscriber mix.  We continue to prefer Airtel, given improving 4G subscriber mix, astuteness in spectrum acquisition approach, healthy network capacity and strong free cash flow (FCF) generation. We maintain our Buy recommendation on the stock with a revised price target (PT) of Rs 850  Motilal Oswal  We expect better valuation multiple for the stock given: a) a consistent 20% growth opportunity, b) low concern on 5G, and c) the company turning profitable with high 50% plus growth due to operating leverage.  The Rs 160b uncalled Rights issue and Rs 52b investment by Google should offset Bharti’s investment in 5G over the next two years.  We see potential upsides for both India and Africa businesses aided by steady earnings growth. We value Bharti on FY24E, assigning 11x EV/EBITDA to the India Mobile business and 5x to the Africa business, and arriving at our SoTP based Target Price of Rs 910. The ensuing earnings growth, 5% FCF yield, and ~25% deleveraging augur well for the stock. Maintain Buy.  At 09:17 hrs Bharti Airtel was quoting at Rs 708.35, up Rs 4.00, or 0.57 percent on the BSE.

Out of the 72,098 MHz of total spectrum on offer, around 71 percent or 51,236 MHz has been sold in the auction held through 40 rounds of bidding over the past seven days, Vaishnaw said. The government has received a &quot;total bid amount of Rs 1,50,173 crore&quot;, the minister noted.  The spectrum allocation will be completed by August 10, Vaishnaw said, adding that the amount of spectrum purchased is &quot;enough to cover the whole country with 5G&quot;.  The successful auction of 5G spectrum is also a &quot;healthy sign&quot; for the country's telecom sector, he further said.  Reliance Jio, the telecom arm of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), is the largest acquirer of 5G spectrum, with bids of over Rs 88,000 crore.  Jio is the only bidder to have acquired 700 MHz in all 22 circles, Vaishnaw said. 700 MHz has a range from 5 to 10 km, which gives the telecom operate a solid base coverage.  Cumulatively, Jio has acquired 24,740Mhz (700, 800, 1800, 3300, 26GHz) of the spectrum put on auction, at a payable amount of Rs 88,078 crore.  Among the three other bidders, Bharti Airtel took 19,867 MHz (700, 800, 1800, 3300, 26GHz) for a payable amount of Rs 43,084 crore. Vodafone Idea, which is considered as the third major telecom sector player after Jio and Airtel in terms of market share acquired spectrum worth Rs 18,799 crore.  Adani Data Networks, an arm of the Adani Group and the latest entrant in the sector, has acquired 400 MHz for a payable amount of Rs 212 crore.  Jio, which emerged as the top bidder, has consolidated its leadership position in all 22 circles by acquiring right to use spectrum in the 700MHz, 800MHz, 1800MHz, 3300MHz and 26GHz bands.  &quot;Jio is fully ready for 5G rollout in the shortest period of time because of its nationwide fibre presence, all-IP network with no legacy infrastructure, indigenous 5G stack and strong global partnerships across the technology ecosystem,&quot; the company said in a statement.  Jio’s unique 700 MHz spectrum footprint will make it the only operator providing 5G services across India. &quot;We will celebrate ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ with a pan India 5G rollout. Jio is committed to offering world-class, affordable 5G and 5G-enabled services,&quot; Akash Ambani, chairman of the telecom giant, said.  Gopal Vittal, the MD &amp;amp; CEO of Bharti Airtel, which emerged as the second highest bidder, said they adopted a &quot;deliberate strategy to buy the best spectrum assets at a substantially lower relative cost compared to our competition&quot;.  &quot;We are confident that we will be able to deliver the best 5G experience in India in terms of coverage, speeds and latency.

AIRTEL,2022-07-30T11:32:50+05:30,Asha Menon,Explained | 5G Auction: Why the sudden interest in 700MHz?,"The band went unsold in the previous two auctions, but this time, it saw a very, very different reception  ","On July 27, on day one of the 5G spectrum auction, there was a surprise.  The 700MHz (megahertz) band, which no one had bid for in the previous two spectrum auctions in 2016 and 2021, suddenly rose to become the belle of the ball. Actually, the third runner-up, but still.  In this auction, 40% of this band was bid for Rs 39,300 crore.  What changed? For one, the reserve price was cut sharply, by 40%, when compared to the 2021 prices.  Also Read: Telecom Minister asks industry for suggestions for new framework  Reserve price? It’s what the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), or any seller, asks as the minimum price for what is being auctioned. Since this price was set too high in the last two auctions, bidders ignored more than 60% of the bands on sale.   Then, didn’t all bands see more interest this time? Not the kind of interest 700MHz saw. On day one, the other spectrum in the low band–below 1GHz–attracted much fewer bids. When 40% of 700Mhz was bid for, only 0%, 15% and 17% of 600MhZ, 800MHz and 900MhZ respectively were bid for, according to Nomura. In fact, even in the higher-frequency bands–1.8GHz to 2.5GHz–the interest was less… between 9 and 30%. Only in the premium band, of 3.3GHz and 26 GHz bands, was there greater interest. In this band, 72% was bid for.   What is so special about the 700MHz band? All lower-frequency bands can travel longer distances than higher frequency bands...  Then why not 600MHz or even 800 MHz? “Those aren’t standardised bands for 5G globally,” said Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint. There are four or five different kinds of 5G spectrum that are generally deployed globally, and 700MHz is one of them. Personal gadgets are usually made to tap into these spectrum bands. If a mobile or laptop manufacturer wants to access a different spectrum band, like 600MHz or 800MHz, then they have to either build new models or customise their existing models, and spend additionally for certification and so on, according to Shah. Why would the manufacturers do that for one or two telecom operators? But there is more to 700MHz than travelling long distances and being common…  Also watch: Everything you need to know about 5G  Like what? It has to do with the way 5G technologies work too, according to Shah. “Think of the 700Mhz band like a highway, and that it can take a certain number of cars. With 5G technologies, the same breadth of road can be made to carry more cars… for example, stacking cars one on top of another,” he said. In fact, with these 5G technologies, you can get a lower-frequency band like 700MHz to work better than 4G technology running on a higher-frequency band like 1,800MHz, he added. That is, you can get a narrower road to carry more traffic than a much wider road. Also, 5G technologies allow for better integration of bands with different frequencies. Therefore, if a telco has bought bands across frequencies, they can use lower-frequency bands for wider reach and layer it with high-frequency bands for speedy transmission of data, to run higher-end applications. 4G-plus allowed for integration of bands too, said Shah, but 5G architecture works much better for this.  In all, 700MHz or 0.7GHz gives wider coverage; can be used across various geographies; and can deliver better data speeds when integrated with higher-frequency bands leveraging the advanced 5G architecture.  ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/explained-5g-auction-why-the-sudden-interest-in-700mhz-8919991.html

","Reliance Jio is expected to spend the most in 5G spectrum auction that will start today at around 10 am, followed by Bharti Airtel whereas modest participation is seen from Vodafone Idea and Adani Group, analysts said based on Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) data.  R Chandrasekhar, former telecom secretary, told CNBC TV18 that considering the total EMD the bidding amount could reach around &quot;Rs 2 lakh crore against the total spectrum available&quot;.  While Adani group recently made a paltry Rs 100 crore EMD, Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio made an EMD of Rs 14,000 crore. The amount of bandwidth that a corporation can bid for in the auction is reflected in EMD.  &quot;Operators will bid for 5G networks, reducing SUC (spectrum usage charges) and enhancing existing spectrum bands, resulting in demand mainly led by 3.3/26 gigahertz (GHz) spectrum bands,&quot; brokerage firm Jefferies said in a note last week reported by Mint.  The 700 megahertz (MHz) spectrum band can be crucial for telcos if they want to expand in rural areas. However, the rollout is expected to be more intense in regions where use is high, according to Chandrasekhar.  Other spectrums from the low-frequency band available for bidding are 600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, and 2300 MHz. The mid-frequency band consists of 3300 MHz and the high-frequency spectrum band is 26 GHz.  5G auction is expected to generate between Rs 80,000 crore and Rs 1,00,000 crore in revenue, enabling ultra-high speeds that are 10 times faster than 4G, as well as modern products and business models. The spectrum allocation will be done by August after the auction.  The value of the highest band, 72 GHz of spectrum, is rated Rs 4.3 lakh crore. However, the telcos have sought price cuts of over 90 percent in the price reserve.  Many giant tech companies like Facebook and Google are seeking allocation of the spectrum at nominal rates, pitting the incumbent telcos against them in the 5G race.  Telcos fear that such moves will destroy their businesses.  The rollout of 5G is going to take 12-15 months and probably going to be limited to urban centres.

AIRTEL,2022-07-25T19:44:22+05:30,Suchitra Mandal,MC Explainer | 5G spectrum auction: All you need to know about it,"The bidding strategy of telcos for the C-band, the major 5G spectrum, remains a bit foggy because it is considered quite expensive.","The auction of spectrum that supports 5G services in India starts on July 26, with about 72,000 MHz under nine bands up for sale with a validity period of 20 years.  The Union Cabinet approved the auction on June 15 and allowed non-telecom service providers to bid for spectrum to set up captive 5G networks.  What is spectrum and how does it work?  Airwaves are radio frequencies within the electromagnetic spectrum that can carry information wirelessly for a range of services including telecommunications. The government manages and allocates airwaves to companies or sectors for their use.  Spectrum can be divided into bands ranging from low frequency to high frequency, which determines their usage and is useful in allocation.  A low-frequency wave is one that gets repeated a fewer number of times within a second, whereas a high-frequency wave is repeated more number of times within a second. High-frequency waves carry more data and are faster than lower-frequency waves but can be blocked or obstructed easily. Lower-frequency waves can provide wider coverage.  What spectrum do telecom companies require?  For telecom purposes, spectrum in the 400 MHz to 4 GHz range is the most optimum, according to the GSM Association, an organisation that represents the interests of mobile network operators.  Operators can provide 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G services using one frequency band if they have enough spectrum.  For mobile technology in India, 2G services use the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands, 3G uses 900 MHz and 2100 MHz, 4G uses 850 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2300 MHz, and 2500 MHz, and 5G uses 3.5MHz and 700 MHz bands. Operators also use other bands available with them in some capacity for the provision of these networks.  The 900 MHz band, which has been in use for mobile communications for over 20 years, has a superior commercial ecosystem with better-developed technology standards and is suitable for offering GSM-based voice calls as well as 4G broadband services. After 900 MHz, the band suitable for GSM is 1800 MHz, which is also the core band used globally for LTE (long-term evolution), a 4G mobile communications standard.  5G spectrum bands can be clubbed into low, mid and high spectrum buckets.  Low band spectrum, which is less than 1 GHz (600 MHz,700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz), offers blanket coverage suitable to serve thousands of customers over long distances with fewer towers. These bands are ideal for wide and in-building coverage and when bundled with high-spectrum bands can be used for commercial mobile and broadcasting services.  The mid-band spectrum ranges from 1 GHz to 6 GHz (1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, and 2300 MHz) and provides coverage as well as the capacity to carry more data while traveling significant distances.  The high bands range from 24 GHz to 40 GHz and are also known as the millimetre wave spectrum, which are ideal for speedy networks over short ranges. However, this range is subject to interference from dense objects.  What spectrum will operators bid for?  The government auctions a fixed amount of spectrum within specified band/s to be utilised by operators for providing communication and network services to consumers.  Operators may already have acquired some amount of spectrum in different bands from previous auctions, including those to be offered in the upcoming auction, which they might buy to consolidate their airwave holdings. Getting contiguous spectrum in minimum blocks of 5 MHz or more facilitates high-speed data processing.  What’s at stake in the July 26 auction?  There are nine bands and over 72,000 MHz of spectrum on offer in the upcoming auction. The bands on offer are in the 600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 3.3 GHz, and 26 GHz range.  These bands can help operators strengthen their network coverage and can optimise their current spectrum holdings. It will be important for operators to balance their planned investments with the potential benefits of each band.  The 700 MHz band is an important low-frequency 5G band that needs fewer towers. However, as per industry experts, a minimum chunk of 15 MHz of this frequency may be needed for its best use and that would cost Rs 60,000 crore.  Two bands – 700 MHz and 600 MHz – have the same reserve price and will account for 50 percent of the value of the entire spectrum to be auctioned at the reserve price. These are new bands and telcos stand to benefit more by topping up their existing low spectrum bands of 800 MHz and 900 MHz. These will strengthen their 4G services and can eventually be re-farmed for 5G use.  What’s different this time around?  Of the nine bands on offer, the 600 MHz, 700 MHz, 3.3 GHz and 26 GHz bands have never been allocated.  This time, a couple of new caveats have been thrown into the mix – the removal of spectrum usage charges (SUC) and the unprecedented allocation of spectrum to enterprises for the deployment of private networks.  SUC is a percentage of adjusted gross revenue that operators pay the department of telecom.  According to DoT’s calculations, winning 40 MHz of spectrum in the mid-band (3300 MHz) and 400 MHz in the mm-wave band (26 GHz) will likely result in an 86 percent decrease in SUC for operators.  What can be expected from the auction?  Demand and cost will drive the bidding strategy of the telcos. However, clubbing the spectrum into 4G and 5G critical bands may help to better understand the differences.  The strategy for 4G bands seems somewhat straightforward. Operators will focus on optimising their existing holdings, with 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands likely getting the most traction.  Reliance Jio Infocomm stands to gain the most in 800 MHz because it has the highest existing spectrum in this band and it would make sense for it to focus on creating a strong position here and maintain maximum market share.  Bharti Airtel and Vi might look to the 900 MHz band for the same reason, while all three private operators may bid for some spectrum in the 1800 MHz band.  In the remaining bands majorly used for 4G, there is a possibility of bidding, particularly by Bharti and Vi, which hold a majority of the existing positions in these bands. However, since the outlay in these bands would also be significant, they might acquire more of the 3.3 GHz spectrum.  The 600 MHz and 700 MHz bands are low-frequency bands that can play a critical role in supplementing the mid-band portfolio, providing better indoor penetration and a larger footprint. However, the chances of telcos bidding for them are slim because they are priced relatively quite high, especially the 600 MHz band, which globally costs about one-third of the 700 MHz band. Operators may give both bands a miss on the expectation that they will be made available at a reduced price in a future auction.  The major 5G bands consist of the remaining two bands i.e. the 3.3 GHz, also called the C-band, and 26 GHz, also called the mm-wave. The mm-wave is the cheapest spectrum available yet, and it would make sense for telcos to acquire the maximum units possible under this in a bid to reduce their overall SUC charges.  The bidding strategy for the C-band, the major 5G band, remains a bit foggy because it is considered quite expensive, especially in light of the decision to allocate it to enterprises for private networks, which might result in subdued revenue potential for telcos.  On the other hand, there are some benefits that might offset these concerns such as zero SUC and relaxed payment terms.  There are 330 units or MHz available for allocation under this band, with a cap of 130 units per operator. Reliance and Bharti are likely to be the two main contenders for this band.  There are mixed expectations with regard to the outcome of the auction. It can be largely construed as harmonious for a majority of the airwaves, with the possibility of fierce competition for the major 5G bands.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/explainer-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-5g-spectrum-auction-8885711.html

While Mittal’s salary and allowances, and performance-linked incentive in 2021-22 were similar to 2020-21, the fall in gross remuneration came largely on account of lower perquisites in the just-concluded fiscal.  In 2021-22, the perquisites stood at Rs 83 lakh, against Rs 1.62 crore in the previous fiscal, a comparison of the annual reports for two years showed.  In FY22, Mittal’s salary and allowances were at about Rs 10 crore, and performance linked incentive was Rs 4.5 crore. In response to an email query by PTI, an Airtel spokesperson said: ”There has been no change in the overall remuneration of Mr Sunil Bharti Mittal, Chairman, from last year.  The insignificant downward change reflected in integrated report 2021-22 is attributable to change in perquisite value.” In response to an email query by PTI, an Airtel spokesperson said: ”There has been no change in the overall remuneration of Mr Sunil Bharti Mittal, Chairman, from last year.

In a relief for mobile phone operators, newcomer Adani Data Networks deposited a small amount, indicating that it is not likely to bid fiercely for spectrum.  The four companies participating in the auction for 5G airwaves together deposited Rs 21,800 crore, according to data published by the Department of Telecommunications. Reliance Jio deposited Rs 14,000 crore, followed by Bharti Airtel with Rs 5,500 crore, and Vodafone Idea with Rs 2,200 crore as earnest money.  The earnest money deposit gives bidders eligibility points on the basis of which they can bid for spectrum. According to the data provided by the telecom department, Reliance Jio has 159,830 eligibility points, Bharti Airtel has 66,330 points, Vodafone Idea has 29,370 eligibility points and Adani has 1,650 points.

The companies may choose to bid less than this amount.    Adani Data Networks deposited Rs 100 crore. The company said earlier it wants to set up a captive network for its own establishments and has no plan to enter the consumer mobility segment.  With the amount that Adani has deposited, it can buy spectrum worth Rs 700 crore, which means its bids may be limited to the 26 GHz band a few circles. This may give the telecom operators some relief as they had expected the Adani Group to bid fiercely for the 5G spectrum.  The auction of 5G airwaves is scheduled to start on July 26. The government is expected to garner Rs 80,000 crore to Rs 1 lakh crore as revenue from the sale of the spectrum, which supports wireless internet access at a much higher speed than the current 4G communications standard.

The spectrum auction, scheduled to start on July 26, may see aggressive bids for some frequency bands, with the entry of Adani Data Networks and established players Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel looking to strengthen their hold in the industry.  &quot;...applications have been received from the...applicants for participation in the 2022 Auction for rights to use Spectrum in 600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3300 MHz and 26 GHz Bands,&quot; the Department of Telecom (DoT) said. Applicants have time till July 19 to withdraw their applications.  Adani Group on Saturday said it is in the race to acquire spectrum, which it said will be used to create a private network to support its businesses from airports to power as well as data centres. A total of 72,097.85 MHz of spectrum worth at least Rs 4.3 lakh crore will be put on the block during the auction, set to commence on July 26, 2022.  The auction will be held for spectrum in various low (600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz), mid (3300 MHz) and high (26 GHz) frequency bands. On Monday, BofA Securities in a note on the Adani Group's plans to bid in 5G auctions said: &quot;We consider this news flow negative for incumbent telcos as it increases competition in upcoming auction bidding as well as in the long-term opportunity to target the enterprise space&quot;.  Brokerage CLSA wondered why would Adani bid in auction versus awaiting a direct spectrum assignment. &quot;The question is why would Adanis bid in auction versus awaiting a direct spectrum assignment? Adani's entry will create uncertainty over spectrum pricing in the 5G auctions, which was expected to see bidding competition primarily between Bharti Airtel and RJio,&quot; it said in a report.  Goldman Sachs said that while the group has stated it does not intend to be in the consumer mobility space, &quot;we believe if the Adani Group does end up buying spectrum in the upcoming auction, it could potentially increase competition in enterprise 5G, in addition to opening the doors for the Adani Group to expand into consumer mobile services over time&quot;. Globally, 5G services have been launched in three bands -- 700MHz (coverage), 3.5GHz (5G coverage and capacity) and 26GHz (capacity and low latency).  &quot;However, with Adani group ruling out offering consumer mobility services, we believe that its participation in 5G spectrum auctions will be limited to 3.5 GHz and 26 GHz bands for provision of private enterprise 5G network services,&quot; said Credit Suisse. The group's foray to provide standalone 5G enterprise network solutions was a tad &quot;unclear&quot; given that globally, 5G enterprise use cases are still under pilot stages, it added.  Credit Suisse also questioned the rationale behind bidding for 5G spectrum in auctions when the Centre has already allowed private enterprises to set up a captive non-public network by acquiring spectrum from the government for a nominal cost and without any licence fees. &quot;Whereas acquiring a 100 MHz block on a pan-India basis in 3.5 GHz band is likely to cost Rs 317 billion (Rs 31,700 crore) and 500 MHz in 26 GHz band is likely to cost another Rs 35 billion (Rs 3,500 crore). Of course, these come with comfortable payment terms,&quot; it said.  Credit Suisse felt that the possibility of Adani Group foraying into consumer mobility in the future is &quot;non-zero&quot;. &quot;While the Adani group has expressly denied intentions of entering the consumer mobility business, we believe that market participants may still view this as a low, distant possibility given the sector's history. However, it would require a meaningfully higher capital commitment...&quot; it added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/adani-data-networks-jio-airtel-vodafone-idea-to-bid-for-spectrum-8814581.html

An Adani Group entity has joined the race to acquire 5G telecom spectrum, which would pit it against Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio, Sunil Bharti Mittal's Airtel and Vodafone-Birla Group joint venture Vi.  However, Adani Group in a statement clarified that its intention to acquire 5G spectrum is to provide a private network for airports and its ports business and not providing mass telecom services.  Nonetheless, the sirens sounded on Dalal Street as investors feared the possibility of entry of another deep-pocketed player in the industry may not bode well for existing players.  As of 9.37 am, Bharti Airtel was down 4.53 per cent to Rs 663.75 on BSE. Reliance Industries, which owns Jio, also fell 0.3 percent to Rs 2383.95. Vodafone Idea, on the other hand, was not affected much as it traded with marginal gains at Rs 8.46.  The government is putting 72 Ghz of 5G frequencies for sale that could net up to Rs 4.5 lakh-crore at base prices. The airwaves will be auctioned for 20 years across 10 bands ranging from 600 Mhz to 26 Ghz at prices recommended by the telecom regulator.  Four companies – Airtel, Jio, Vodafone Idea and Adani Group – have put in applications to participate in India's first auction of 5G airwaves starting July 26.  Earlier, it was expected that the bidding war will be muted, however, the entry of Adani in the fray has changed the situation.

Weekly 14 period RSI (relative strength index) showing positive indication. One may expect further strengthening of upside momentum in the stock price ahead,"The market registered gains in four out of five days in the week ended July 8 and clocked a 3 percent rally to end above the 16,200 mark on the Nifty, backed by positive global cues with declining oil prices and volatility. On Friday, the index climbed half a percent to 16,221.  The Nifty50 filled its recent bearish gap zone by closing decisively above hurdle of 16,172 levels on Friday and formed bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly scale with higher high higher low formation for third consecutive week, indicating the trend is favourable for bulls. The index can march towards 16,500, the next hurdle, if it sustains above 16,000 mark, the crucial support, in coming sessions, experts said.  &quot;The index has surpassed its crucial hurdle of 16,178. This indicates that the market will be showing a bigger pullback to retrace the entire correction from 18,115 (April 2022 high) to the recent swing low of 15,184,&quot; Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com said.  He further said the 50 percent retracement of this correction is seen around 16,650 while the '200-day EMA' (exponential moving average) hurdle is around 16,550. Hence, he expects the Nifty to continue its up-move in the short term towards 16,550-16,650.  On the flipside, the support base is shifting higher with the index upmove and the support has now shifted to 16,000-15,900 range, he said. Even the option writers have built positions in 16,000 strike which hints this to be an important support.  In the coming week, small corrections for one to two sessions cannot be ruled out but any such corrections should be used as a buying opportunity, the expert advised.  Here are the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the July 8 closing prices:  Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities  KEC International: Buy | LTP: Rs 411.1 | Stop-Loss: Rs 385 | Target: Rs 450 | Return: 9.5 percent  The weekly timeframe chart of KEC International indicates that the stock price has been in a larger consolidation pattern over the last few months. The stock price is currently finding strong resistance (as per the concept of change in polarity) around Rs 415 levels. Hence, a sustainable move above this area could open sharp upside for the stock price ahead.  We observe a formation higher bottoms on the weekly chart and last week's low at Rs 381 could be considered as a new higher bottom of the sequence. Weekly 14 period RSI (relative strength index) showing positive indication. One may expect further strengthening of upside momentum in the stock price ahead.  Buying can be initiated in KEC at CMP (Rs 411), add more on dips down to Rs 400, wait for the upside target of Rs 450 in the next 3-4 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 385.    EIH: Buy | LTP: Rs 134 | Stop-Loss: Rs 125 | Target: Rs 147 | Return: 10 percent  The down trend of the last few months seems to have completed in this hotel stock (EIHOTEL), as we observe a sustainable upside bounce this week as per weekly chart. The formation of swing low at Rs 120.25 in the week before last signal a formation of important bottom reversal pattern.  The formation of doji or high wave type weekly candle patterns in the last two weeks, placement of uptrend line support and double bottom formation (slight lower bottom) are all suggesting further sustainable upside for the stock price ahead. Volume has started to rise during upside movement in the stock price and weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication.  One may look to buy EIH at CMP (Rs 134), add more on dips down to Rs 130 and wait for the upside target of Rs 147 in the next 3-4 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 125.    Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  M&amp;amp;M Financial Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 198 | Stop-Loss: Rs 185 | Target: Rs 230 | Return: 16 percent  The stock was consolidating between the trading range of Rs 160 and Rs 190 for two months. However, last Friday the stock broke an important resistance level with an expansion in volume and closed above the same.  On higher levels, it would find minor resistance at Rs 210 level. The strategy should be to buy at current levels and lower around Rs 190. Place stop-loss at Rs 185.    HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,397 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,330 | Target: Rs 1,550 | Return: 11 percent  The stock is forming a rising top and rising bottom series and on a weekly basis. It closed above the level of Rs 1,370, which is positive for the stock. On the dismissal of Rs 1,420, the stock will validate the formation of a double bottom.  Above Rs 1,420 level, it will rally to Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,550 levels. It is advisable to buy 50 percent at current levels and balance at Rs 1,370. For the same place a stop-loss at Rs 1,330.    IRB Infrastructure Developers: Buy | LTP: Rs 210 | Stop-Loss: Rs 190 | Target: Rs 250 | Return: 19 percent  It is forming a falling wedge. It is a bullish consolidation formation and it is a long elongated triangle, which took time to hit the target, which is at Rs 346.  However, in the medium term, we can see the level of Rs 250, which is a good upside from the current levels. The strategy should be to buy at current levels and balance at Rs 200 with a stop-loss at Rs 190.    Jatin Gohil, Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Analyst at Reliance Securities  Container Corporation of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 657 | Stop-loss: Rs 585 | Target: Rs 780 | Return: 19 percent  Since September 2021, the stock oscillated downwards amidst profit booking and after a Double Bottom formation, it has created higher low as well. On the week ended July 8, the stock breached its prior falling trend and rose to 6-week closing high, where volume was above average.  Its weekly RSI gave buy signal after a bullish divergence. This could take the stock towards Rs 718-753-780 in the short-term.  In case of any decline, the stock will find support around its recent higher low formation, which is placed at Rs 585.    Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra Financial Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 198 | Stop-Loss:Rs 164 | Target: Rs 244 | Return: 23 percent  On the week ended July 8, closing above its 200-week SMA, the stock breached its prior bearish jinx, as it used to reverse after testing that moving average and did register noticeable falls. Spike in volume and rise in future open interest (OI) signals that major market participants are in favour of the bulls.  The key technical indicators are positively poised on short-term timeframe charts. We believe the stock may witness a follow-up move.  This could lead the stock towards Rs 224 initially and Rs 244 subsequently. On the lower side, the stock will find support around its prior month's lowest level, which is placed at Rs 164.    Dalmia Bharat: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,434 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,290 | Target: Rs 1,730 | Return: 21 percent  The stock tested its 61.8 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of prior mega up-move (Rs 403-2,548), which was placed at Rs 1,220 in June 2022. After forming a base around that level, the stock witnessed a strong rebound.  Its weekly RSI gave buy signal post a bullish divergence. We believe the stock is on the verge of a turnaround.  The stock has potential to move towards Rs 1,640 initially and Rs 1,730 subsequently in the short-term. In case of any decline, the stock will find support around its upper band of the base.    Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com  Bharti Airtel: Buy | LTP: Rs 695.15 | Stop-Loss: Below Rs 666 | Target: Rs 835 | Return: 6 percent  In the recent corrective phase, the stock has taken support around its swing low of Rs 640 and has seen a pullback move. Prices have given breakout from a falling trendline resistance and the short term average has given a positive crossover above the medium term indicating a positive trend.  The ‘RSI Smoothed’ oscillator is in buy mode and is showing a positive momentum.  Hence, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 695-692 for potential targets of Rs 730 and Rs 735.

Based on the market cap of Indus Towers at the end of day's trade on July 8, the combined 7 percent stake is worth Rs 3,952 crore.","US private equity major KKR and top pension fund Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) are currently exploring options to exit India’s largest telecom infrastructure firm Indus Towers (formerly called Bharti Infratel), multiple industry sources with knowledge of the matter told Moneycontrol.  “Both these players have been invested for a few years now and are keen to sell their existing stakes in Indus Towers via the block deal route. They are looking for a suitable opportunity,” one of the persons cited above told Moneycontrol without elaborating on the deal timelines and structure.  CPPIB currently holds a 2.15 percent stake while KKR holds a 4.85 percent stake in the firm. Based on the market cap of Indus Towers at the end of day's trade on July 8, the combined 7 percent stake is worth Rs 3,952 crore. The promoter category which includes the Bharti Group and The Vodafone Group holds a 67.49 percent stake.  In 2017, Bharti Airtel sold a 10.3 percent stake in Bharti Infratel to a consortium of investors including CPPIB and KKR. Funds managed by KKR had also previously invested in Bharti Infratel between 2008 and 2015.  Two other persons confirmed the exit plans of both the funds and one of them added that the stake held by the two investors in Indus Towers is not strategic in nature and that both were looking to monetise it and generate liquidity.  All the three persons cited above spoke to Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity.  KKR declined to comment while an email query sent to CPPIB and Indus Towers was left unanswered at the time of publishing.  Indus Towers has seen plenty of block deal action in 2022. Last week, Bharti Airtel had purchased an additional 2.06 percent stake in Indus Towers via the block deal route.  Earlier this year, the Vodafone Group had sold a 7.1 percent stake in Indus Towers; 2.4 percent through a block deal and 4.7 percent to Bharti Airtel — raising around Rs 3,831 crore.

Sangwan has over 17 years of experience in corporate law and started her career at GE where she was instrumental in leading the compliance programme. Prior to joining Amazon Pay, she was part of Bharti Airtel's legal and compliance team.  &quot;At Airtel, she played a significant role in acquiring a payments license in 2009, took part in multiple M&amp;amp;A  deals, and was also one of the founding members of Airtel Money in 2008,&quot; a statement by Slice said.  At Amazon Pay, Sangwan played a key role in building the fintech arm of Amazon in India - including bill payments, UPI, launched a variety of products ranging from payments acceptance, issuance, co-branded cards and so on.  She graduated from Faculty of Law,  Delhi University and also has a degree in CS from the institute of company secretaries of India.  The move comes at a time when Slice was making a transition to making payments its key offering as opposed to its core business model of offering credit line-linked Visa cards with a focus on new to credit and subprime millennial customers.  Moneycontrol had reported on May 25 that the company turned conservative and has restricted its stand-out interest-free 'Pay-in-3' feature to only select customers.  Rajan Bajaj, CEO of Slice said, &quot;Bhawna has joined the slice team at a time when we are strategising our expansion into the payments segment. As the market continues to evolve, we must have impactful leaders who can guide the business through not only a solid product portfolio but also adapt to changing government regulations, ensuring consumer protection and data and privacy mandates.&quot;  &quot;Bhawna will play an important role in enabling Slice to operate with the highest standards of ethics for sustained and responsible long-term success in the market.&quot;  Commenting on her new role, Sangwan said, &quot;Slice’s role in giving access to credit and enabling financial inclusion for millions has been phenomenal and nothing short of inspiring. I am looking forward to being a big part of slice’s next phase of growth in the payments segment.&quot;  In a blow to the company's business model, the RBI issued a clarification on June 20 to fintechs saying that issuing credit through Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) such as wallets and prepaid cards is prohibited as per PPI norms.  RBI also said that any non-compliance in this regard can attract penal action from the regulator.  Industry bodies including the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and the Payments Council of India (PCI) have made representations to the RBI and the government seeking clarity on the norms.  &amp;nbsp; ",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/slice-appoints-former-amazon-pay-director-as-legal-chief-amid-new-regulatory-challenges-8732621.html

The family is considering all options for offshore credit such as structured financing, bonds, and even bridge loans. Banks that have been sounded out include Standard Chartered, JPMorgan, Citibank, BNP Paribas, and the Bank of America, sources told the publication.  Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.  Sources added that while final terms, quantum and transaction details are yet undecided, the funds will “soon” be used to buy some of Singtel’s stake in the Indian telecom company. Singtel has held stake in Airtel since 2000.  The Mittal family owns 50.56 percent and Singtel 49.44 percent of Bharti Telecom, which in turn owns 35.85 percent of Bharti Airtel. Besides this, Singtel also owns 14 percent directly in Bharti Airtel while the Mittals own 6.04 percent – taking their effective stockholding to 31.72 and 24.13 percent respectively.

Moody’s has also changed the outlook for the company to stable from positive.,"Moody’s Investors Service has upgraded Bharti Airtel’s rating to Baa3, citing continued strengthening of its operational metrics as well as stabilisation of the financial profile.  It has withdrawn the company’s Ba1 corporate family rating. Moody’s has also changed the outlook for the company to stable from positive.  “The rating upgrade reflects the continued strengthening of Bharti’s operational metrics as well as the stabilization of its financial profile, including lower leverage levels and improving profitability. Moreover, we expect that these improvements can be sustained given Bharti’s solid market position, rising profitability at its core Indian mobile business and prudent financial management,” Moody’s Senior Vice President Annalisa Di Chiara said.    Bharti’s Baa3 rating considers the company’s position as one of the largest telecom service operators globally in terms of subscribers (491 million), its solid market position in India’s high-growth mobile market and its large spectrum holdings, a statement by Moody’s said.  Entities given Baa3 ratings are considered medium grade and are subject to moderate credit risk and the firm has an acceptable ability to repay short term obligations, it added.  The company had posted more than two-fold jump in consolidated net profit for March quarter 2021-22 to Rs 2,008 crore, buoyed by a lift in average revenue per user and an exceptional gain.  Revenue from operations rose 22.3 per cent to Rs 31,500 crore during the fourth quarter of 2021-22, compared to the year-ago period. The net profit before exceptional items for the quarter came in at Rs 1,860 crore, while exceptional gain boosted the net profit to Rs 2,008 crore. As a result, profit after tax was over 2.5 times higher for March quarter, compared to Rs 759 crore recorded in the year-ago period.  Consolidated net debt excluding lease obligations for Bharti Airtel stood at Rs 1,23,544 crore as on March 31, 2022, compared to Rs 1,15,512.4 crore in the year-ago period.  The change of outlook to stable indicates that the company’s performance is expected to improve even after it invests in upcoming 5G auction, Moody’s said. “The company’s tariff increase in December 2021 helped drive ARPUs (average revenue per user) higher and supports Moody’s expectation of a sustainable profitability level over the next 12-18 months.  Moody’s expects a further 15-20 per cent increase in Bharti’s consolidated adjusted EBITDA by the end of fiscal 2023, reflecting stable growth at its Indian and African operations, which are held through its 56 per cent owned subsidiary, Airtel Africa plc and contribute around 30 per cent of consolidated EBITDA.  Earlier, Moody’s had assigned Ba1 corporate family rating to Bharti which indicated substantial risk on repayment of credit offered to the company.

On expected lines, Africa performance was muted due to seasonality. Going forward, data subscriber addition momentum, the 5G auction outcome and the potential timeline for further tariff hikes will be the key things to watch out.  Outlook The current inflationary scenario is restricting customer upgrades as the cost of entry-level smartphones has risen. Our EBITDA estimates remain unchanged, with a 15% CAGR over FY22-24.

AIRTEL,2022-05-16T06:38:50+05:30,Sameet Chavan,Hot Stocks | Here's why you should buy Indraprastha Gas and sell Bharti Airtel for short term,"Despite a challenging session on last Friday, Indraprastha Gas ended the session firmly in the green. Price-wise, we can witness a decisive breakout along with substantial rise in volumes.","Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, at Angel One  Last Monday's session started on a nervous note as global sentiments remained weak over the weekend. The index performed within a range throughout the first half and, despite some challenges, the Nifty managed to hold 16,000 on a closing basis. However, the banking finally succumbed to the sell off, leading the Nifty below the psychological point to mark lowest close in last 10 months last Thursday.  On Friday, we started off significantly higher on the back of global relief; but once again our market failed to sustain at higher levels and eventually erased all gains in the latter half. With this, Nifty once again lost nearly 4 percent on a weekly basis.  The global macro factors have weighed down heavily on financial markets across the globe and we are certainly not spared with it. The oversold market is in a denial mode to give small recovery, in fact, last Friday's rebound got completely sold into towards the fag end. This certainly does not augur well for the bulls.  The recent low of 15,671 is not far from current levels now and the moment we slide below it, it will create a panic kind of situation in the market. Below this, 15,350 - 15,200 are the next levels to watch out for.  On the flipside, 16,000 - 16,200 has now become a stiff hurdle. First sign of relief is possible only above these levels. Till this time, one should avoid trading aggressively in the market.  If we take glance at the weekly time frame chart, we can see sheet anchor in the form of '89-EMA' (exponential moving average) placed around 15,600. Historically, this moving average has proved it's mettle and has provided cushion to severe falls. It would be very interesting to see how market behaves around it.  Hence, although the trend is strongly bearish at this moment, we advise investors with a slightly broader time frame, should start nibbling in quality propositions in a staggered manner. Also, since the global factors are driving the markets completely, traders should keep a close tab on all these developments.  Here is one buy call and one sell call for short term:  Indraprastha Gas: Buy | LTP: Rs 372.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 358 | Target: Rs 398 | Return: 7 percent  Most of the gas distribution companies underwent a massive price correction over the past few months and in this process, IGL plummeted more than 40 percent in a span of nine months.  However, the fall seems to have arrested now as stock prices recently did not participate in the broader market sell off and in fact, despite a challenging session on Friday, this stock ended the session firmly in the green. Price-wise, we can witness a decisive breakout along with substantial rise in volumes.  Hence, we recommend buying this stock for a trading target of Rs 398. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 358.    Bharti Airtel: Sell | LTP: Rs 689.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 714 | Target: Rs 664 | Return: 4 percent  Since last few months, this stock was neither moving higher nor correcting. So, it was more of a consolidation phase for this telecom giant. But on last Friday, the stock seemed to have surrendered to the sell off and has slipped below the ‘200-day SMA’ (simple moving average), which has been acting as a sheet anchor on numerous occasions historically.  But the way it closed on last Friday, things do not look good for the counter and this time, it may extend its correction phase below this sacrosanct moving average.  Thus, we recommend selling on a minor bounce towards Rs 694 – 697 for a near term target of Rs 664. The strict stop-loss needs to be placed at Rs 714.

This will be Airtel's fourth digital technology hub in India and first in the Western region to support its strategy to pivot to a digital services company, especially as 5G services are on the horizon.  Confirming the plans, Bharti Airtel chief information officer Pradipt Kapoor told PTI that Airtel is rapidly scaling up its in-house digital talent pool to support its transformation into a digital telco. &quot;Pune being an established IT and tech hub, makes it an obvious choice for Airtel to tap into the talent pool and also drive cross-industry collaboration,&quot; Kapoor said.  Airtel is looking to hire across multiple experiences and domains – Big Data, Machine Learning, Dev Ops, and Tech Ops. The company already has similar digital technology hubs in Gurgaon, Bengaluru (Airtel X-Labs) and Noida. These facilities employ close to 3,000 people. “In addition to top global talent including Silicon Valley and domestic start-ups, Airtel is hiring from engineering institutes like IITs, NITS, IIITs for its digital technology hubs,” a company official said.  Airtel claims to have made investments worth more than $46 billion in the last couple of decades to create digital infrastructure over which 40 per cent of India's economic and digital activity takes place. Airtel's digital assets include the Airtel Thanks app, Wynk Music app, and Airtel Xstream content platform with over 180 million monthly active users.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/airtel-to-set-up-digital-technology-hub-in-pune-to-hire-500-people-by-end-of-this-fiscal-8509361.html

AIRTEL,2022-05-12T20:12:05+05:30,PTI,"Battle hardened Bharti Airtel's future looks good now, says Sunil Mittal","Speaking at a CII event, Sunil Mittal noted that the company has been through many ups and downs, including regulatory challenges and market competition, and is now better placed in the market. ","With only &quot;two-and-a-half players&quot; left in the highly competitive domestic telecom sector, the future of battle hardened Bharti Airtel looks good now, its Chairman Sunil Mittal said on Thursday. Speaking at a CII event, Mittal noted that the company has been through many ups and downs, including regulatory challenges and market competition, and is now better placed in the market.  &quot;The balance sheet is healthy, it's strong. And we are now down to two-and-a-half players for a country the size of India so the future looks good now. Now will there be one more crisis?… who knows but this company has become very very strong and battle hardened,&quot; Mittal noted. Noting that some of the salient features have been relentless focus on customer needs and customer satisfaction, he said, &quot;we have been very hard on ourselves. I am the biggest critic of my own company&quot;.  Recalling the challenging period, he said that it has turned out to be a delightful story at the end but there were moments in the journey of Airtel, when the question was not if but when the company will collapse. &quot;We had an existential crisis, stock was listed a few months back at Rs 45, it was brought down to knees at Rs 19. Cash was running out, revenues were not building fast enough and we had taken a big bite of going all India,&quot; Mittal said.  &quot;So the ship was clearly creaking, every limit was moving and it looked like things could go wrong. And that is where you know one is reminded that if you have the right strategy in place, if you have the right technology in place that will give you the right platform to win,&quot; Mittal said. In that difficult period from 2002-2003, Mittal said he managed to keep the team motivated.  &quot;I said if I can become the lightning rod of the organisation, take all the pain and burn myself and keep the organisation insulated, I think we will be able to win this big war that was going on. And the fact is from that time, the Rs 19 stock went to Rs 1,200 in a matter of 18 months,&quot; he stated. According to him, the situation again became challenging in 2008-09 when 12 new licences were given. &quot;All the big players came in, both foreign and Indian, from Docomo to Telenor, everybody came in and again the market went through a huge cycle but we were better prepared&quot;.  Loss in the Supreme Court in 2005-06 and changes in spectrum auction norms were the other major incidents which impacted the company's balance, Mittal said. &quot;I wish we had lost this case in 2005-06, just because we won the case he never paid the money and finally when we lost in the Supreme Court, it came back to haunt us all the way back. So it was a back-breaking one,&quot; he said.  The events led to raising of funds through stake sales in the company. &quot;Balance sheet had become stressed and there was a time, I said you will have to dilute ourselves… this company needs to survive. Well how do I care whether I own 40 per cent or 26 per cent? Let's just go and raise capital,&quot; Mittal said.  Elaborating on the market situation, Mittal said the last three years have been &quot;unbelievably relentless&quot;. &quot;India, in large measure, has done exceedingly well because most of the companies have been able to move their supply chain and have been able to step up their production when required… So we have done remarkably well, I would say in every segment of our industry. That's why India today is looking like a place where businesses are still thriving,&quot; he said.  However, he noted that big companies have been able to deal with the challenges very well but medium to lower end businesses have definitely suffered. He said that despite few issues, if there's any country that is well poised and positioned to deal with the tectonic shifts, it is India.  According to him, earlier, the eagle hovered over India and landed in China and Vietnam', and therefore India 'missed the bus'. The current government's zeal of promoting Aatmanirbharta, Digital India and other initiatives has now put India in a sweet spot, especially when it comes to the manufacturing sector, he said.  He also said that adoption of technology and dealing with innovation and disruption are relatively difficult in larger organisations, since the success of Facebook, Whatsapp other e-commerce companies have significantly changed the whole ecosystem. To keep up with the changing times, existing businesses must adopt a futuristic outlook, taking into consideration changes in consumer behaviour, market dynamics and other factors, he added.  Given this outlook, the Bharti group is also adapting to changes and its newer businesses that are seeing success, include Airtel banks, other apps by the company like Wink and cloud services to MSMEs. He also observed that solid partnerships play a key role in building success stories and companies that do not embrace change are bound to suffer.  Technologies of the future would offer immense possibilities that are embedded in the upcoming products like metaverse, robotics, drone management, 5D virtual realities etc, he added. Speaking about building successful enterprises, Mittal mentioned that it is important to realise that one size does not fit all.  Identifying what works for a particular organisation and matching it with partners and thereafter nourishing those principles have proven to work out well, he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/battle-hardened-bharti-airtels-future-looks-good-now-says-sunil-mittal-8497931.html

AIRTEL,2022-04-15T18:00:41+05:30,Chiranjivi Chakraborty,"Telecom Q4 Preview | Average user revenue to soar, subscriber addition to suffer","This will be the first full quarter for telcos after they increased tariffs, which triggered a churn among some user segments.","India’s telecom companies are likely to report a strong performance in the three months ended March, the first full quarter after tariffs were increased in November-December.  Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and Jio Platforms, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, are expected to report 7-9 percent growth in their average revenue per user (ARPU) on a sequential basis, according to analysts polled by Moneycontrol.  Bharti Airtel reported an ARPU of Rs 163 per month in the quarter ended December, while Jio’s ARPU was Rs 151.6 and Vodafone’s was Rs 115.  With the full benefits of the tariff hike, JP Morgan India expects the three telecom companies to report 5-7 percent sequential growth in revenue.  “We expect 4QFY22 to be a strong quarter for telecom companies with likely revenue and EBITDA growth of 6-11% QoQ due to the impact of around 20% tariff hike undertaken by the industry in November 2021,” JM Financial Services said in a preview note.  However, the increase in telecom tariffs is starting to affect the lower rung of telecom subscribers.  User churn  “The industry is witnessing outsized churn in the lower ARPU segments given the entry-level prepaid tariff hike in July 2021, followed by another sharp hike in November 2021. Hence, it is likely to continue to witness muted subscriber addition and limited upgrades to high APRU plans,” JM Financial said.  JP Morgan said most of the subscriber churn may have taken place in the quarter ended March.  Brokerages said Bharti Airtel, which had a customer base of 356 million in India at the end of the third quarter, will likely retain its dominance in both ARPU and subscriber additions.  “We expect Airtel to continue to gain market share with sector-leading ARPU and subscriber growth in 4QFY22,” Credit Suisse Securities India said in a preview note.  Credit Suisse expects Bharti Airtel to report over 1 million new subscribers in the quarter as against a little-changed subscriber base for Reliance Jio and a loss of 4 million users for Vodafone Idea.  JP Morgan said Bharti Airtel may report a 7 percent sequential growth in revenue on the back of a 9 percent jump in ARPU in the quarter.  Reliance Jio is expected to report a 6 percent quarter-on-quarter growth in revenue, helped by a 9 percent rise in ARPU, said JP Morgan. However, the brokerage expects Jio to report a loss of 2 million subscribers as part of the ongoing consolidation of low-income users. Jio had 421 million customers in the third quarter.  Vodafone Idea may report stellar operating profit growth, led by gains from tariff hikes. IIFL Securities expects the company to report a 17 percent on-quarter growth in operating profit even losing subscribers.  Besides the earnings, investors will focus on the management commentary on their subscriber bases, potential tariff hikes this year, capital expenditure plans, the 5G spectrum auction, and margins given the higher fuel costs for running telecom towers in the June quarter.

The Nifty Midcap index gained 3.6 percent and the Smallcap index rose 2.7 percent during the week, while the Nifty50 gained 0.6 percent to close at 17,784.  The good part was that the Nifty50 managed to hold on to the 17,600 mark, which experts feel can act as an immediate crucial support, with resistance remaining at 18,100, the recent highs touched by the market. Breaking on either side could give firm direction to the market in coming days, experts said. The index also strongly held above 50 DMA (17,140), 100 DMA (17,307) and 200 DMA (17,131).  &quot;In the coming week, 17,600 followed by 17,400 are likely to provide some cushion for the index and till the time, we do not close below these key levels, we would continue with our 'buy on decline' strategy,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.  On the flipside, he said, the first sign of strength would be visible after surpassing the 17,900 mark.  This week is likely to be truncated and hence, do not expect any big-bang move in key indices, he feels. &quot;The upside as of now looks limited for the week towards 18,000–18,100. But the way broader market kept buzzing in the challenging phase last week as well, one must continue to focus outside the index.&quot;  The market will remain shut on April 14 for Mahavir Jayanti and Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti, and April 15 for Good Friday.  Here are the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on April 8 closing prices:  Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities  Equitas Holdings: Buy | LTP: Rs 119.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 111 | Target: Rs 132 | Return: 10.5 percent  After showing rangebound action in the last one month, the stock price has moved up sharply in last week. Currently, the stock price has made an attempt of upside breakout of down sloping trend line around Rs 119-120 levels. Hence, a sustainable move above this area could open sharp upside ahead.  The larger degree of higher tops and bottoms is intact as per weekly timeframe chart and the stock price has formed a recent higher bottom at Rs 100 levels. Volume and weekly 14 period RSI (relative strength index) indicates further strengthening of upside momentum for the stock price ahead.  Buying can be initiated in Equitas at current market price), add more on dips down to Rs 114, and wait for the upside target of Rs 132 in the next 3-4 weeks. One can place a stop-loss of Rs 111.    National Fertilizers: Buy | LTP: Rs 60.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 56 | Target: Rs 67.50 | Return: 11.4 percent  The below weekly timeframe chart of National Fertilizers indicates an excellent up-move over the last few weeks. The stock price has witnessed an upside breakout of the crucial resistance of down sloping trend line at Rs 59 and moved up in last week.  The present stock movement could be considered as a crucial upside breakout of an uptrend and a sharp up-move is likely to continue for the near term.  Volume has started to expand during upside breakout in the stock price and weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication. Hence, one may expect further strengthening of upside momentum in the stock price ahead.  One may look to buy NFL at current market price, add more on dips down to Rs 58 and wait for the upside target of Rs 67.50 in the next 3-4 weeks, while placing stop-loss at Rs 56.    Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 106.50 | Stop-Loss: Rs 99.50 | Target: Rs 118 | Return: 10.8 percent  The below weekly timeframe chart of Bombay Dyeing indicates rangebound action over the last 5-6 weeks after a sharp decline of February month. The stock price is currently making an attempt to stage upside breakout of the range movement at Rs 106-107 levels. Hence a sustainable move above this area could open a sharp up-move for the stock price ahead.  The larger degree of positive sequence like higher tops and bottoms is intact and the stock price is now moving up after the formation of new higher bottom. Volume pattern and weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication for the stock price ahead.  One may look to buy Bombay Dyeing at current market price, add more on dips down to Rs 102.50 and wait for the upside target of Rs 118 in the next 3-4 weeks, while placing a stop-loss of Rs 99.50.    Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 741.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 680 | Target: Rs 850-900 | Return: 14.6-21.3 percent  The stock is forming a series of higher tops and higher bottoms, which is extremely positive. The stock has again surpassed its previous highs last week with the decisive dismissal. Such a pattern helps the stock to move into a new bullish segment.  The Rs 680 level will be a great support for the stock and as long as the stock is trading above it, the chances of reaching Rs 850 or Rs 900 will be bright.  The strategy should be to buy at Rs 750 and add more at Rs 710. Place the last stop-loss at Rs 680.    UPL: Buy | LTP: Rs 809.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 780 | Target: Rs 865-900 | Return: 7-11 percent  The stock is forming a V shaped recovery pattern, which indicates a sudden development in the stock, which may lift the stock above its previous highs. This is in contrast to the construction of a circular plane.  The rounding bottom formation enables the stock to make a gradual upward move, while the V-shaped recovery helps the stock to make a rapid upward move.  The stock is a buy at current levels with a stop-loss at Rs 780. At higher levels, resistance would be at Rs 865 and Rs 950 in the coming weeks.

In the process it has broken out of six-month consolidation pattern spanning around a quadrilateral pattern. The daily chart shows that the prices have a tendency to move up in staggered manner since the panic lows of March 2020.  The first leg of consolidation saw it traded between Rs 160 and Rs 210 during August to December 2020. The next leg saw it consolidated between Rs 200-225. The current leg has traversed between Rs 210 and Rs 260.

In the process it has broken out of 6-month long consolidation pattern spanning around a W-shaped pattern. The daily chart shows that the prices have earlier too shown a tendency to move up in staggered manner. The W pattern may also be envisaged as a part of 'flag and pole', which can culminate successfully if prices cross above Rs 785.  The long-term moving averages are positively aligned with 50 DMA (Rs 714.85) trading above the 100 as well as the 200 DMA, while the 100 DMA (Rs 710.90) is also in turn trading above the 200 DMA (Rs 673.13). The latest cross over is part of parallel move of the 50-100 DMA encompassing over last 3 months, including the zigzags intermittently.  The extrapolated levels in contention would be Rs 900 mark, approximately the depth of W pattern after a breakout above the level of Rs 785.

Expert: Astha Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Hem Securities  Bharat Electronics: Buy | LTP: Rs 240 | Stop-Loss: Rs 207 | Target: Rs 260-280 | Return: 8.5-17 percent  On weekly charts, price action shows that after consolidating for 5-6 months, the stock has given strong breakout which signals further upside in stock.  Also MACD (moving average convergence divergence) crossed above its signal line which qualifies bullish trend in stock. Hence we recommend buy with stop-loss of Rs 207 and possible price targets of Rs 260-280.    Havells India: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,268 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,170 | Target: Rs 1,425 | Return: 12.4 percent  On weekly charts, the stock has closed above its all-important moving averages.

Bharti Airtel's Rs 2,500 crore investment to acquire Indus Tower stake is based on the precondition that the amount paid to Vodafone Plc shall be infused as fresh equity in VIL. Subsequently, this amount will be used by VIL to clear its outstanding dues towards Indus. Indus, in turn, should use the amount to pay annual dividends. Assuming Rs 20 per share dividend, Bharti Airtel should receive Rs 2500 crore (including 4.7% stake). The transaction, thus, is cashflow neutral for Bharti and its existing FCF generation and deleveraging trajectory may not be disturbed, it said.  Motilal Oswal believes Bharti Airtel may look to acquire additional 5% share, possibly to increase its stake beyond 50% and become the majority shareholder. This will safeguard Bharti’s holding in Indus, which offers it critical infrastructure. With the onset of 5G and possibility of increased capex, Bharti may require improvement in capital allocation, it added.

AIRTEL,2022-03-04T10:32:49+05:30,Moneycontrol News,"Axis Securities picks 7 large-caps, 5 midcaps, 4 small-caps after Ukraine-Russia-led correction","Commodities will be the biggest gainers and as long as the geopolitical heat continues, it will be the dominating market theme, Axis Securities said.","The significant fall in share prices over the past one-and-a-half-months when most sectors declined in double digits offers investors an opportunity to buy stocks of quality companies.  Margin pressures reflected in corporate earnings for the December quarter due to rising commodity prices, expectations of faster policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve, relentless selling by foreign investors, and the geopolitical tensions with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine weighed on market sentiment.  The benchmark BSE Sensex fell 11 percent during January 17-February 24 before a minor recovery, while the BSE Midcap index dropped 15 percent and the Smallcap index plunged 18.5 percent.  Among sectors, auto, capital goods, energy, healthcare, IT, consumer durables, oil &amp;amp; gas, and realty declined 10-20 percent, while banking, FMCG and power fell 7-9 percent.  Volatility hit the highest level since May 2020, with the India VIX going up to about 30, indicating instability in the market unless the geopolitical risk eases.  The Russia-Ukraine crisis, which continues for the time being despite sanctions imposed by western countries, poses a threat to earnings and economic growth, given the rise in commodity prices, experts said.  Brent crude oil futures, the international benchmark, hit $120 a barrel on March 3, the highest level since 2012 and a rise of 69 percent in more than two months.  Inflation, growth risks  “This would be a negative factor for global trade, posing a downside risk to the global economic growth,” Axis Securities said. “A scenario of oil sustaining above $100 a barrel for some more time will create notable challenges to the oil-importing countries, especially India, which may find it difficult to maintain the trade deficit and the foreign exchange reserves.”  The brokerage said the rise in crude oil prices could delay the cool-off in inflation in the domestic market, which was expected to moderate in the second half of 2022.  However, in the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, commodities would be the biggest gainers and as long as the geopolitical heat continues, it will be the dominating theme in the market, Axis Securities said.  Apart from the current geopolitical issue, upcoming events in March include the Federal Reserve meeting and assembly elections results from five states.  “The direction of the oil prices, bond yields, and dollar index along with the development of the current geopolitical events will further drive the market fundamentals,” the brokerage said, adding that once the dust over the Russia- Ukraine conflict settles, the market is expected to refocus on key events such as inflation and the number of rate hikes in the current calendar year.  Despite the current volatility, the brokerage maintained its Nifty target of 20,200 with a positive long-term view on the market supported by the emerging favourable structure as increasing capital expenditure enables banks to improve credit growth.  The Nifty closed at about 16,500 on March 3. To achieve the target of 20,200, it needs to add 3,700 points, or 22.4 percent, by March 2023. The index touched a record high of 18,604 in October 2021.  The brokerage said the overall boost in the Union Budget 2022-23 expenditure will help deliver broad-based growth in FY23.  Though the earnings momentum has been strong in the past few quarters and largely in line with expectations for the current quarter, they remain the critical factor for the market, said Axis Securities, which foresees FY22, FY23 and FY24 Nifty EPS at Rs 728, Rs 844 and Rs 918, respectively, with a 20 percent CAGR growth over FY21-24.

Bharti Airtel will buy 4.7 percent stake in Indus Towers from Vodafone Plc, the former said in an exchange filing on Friday.  The transaction will be done on the condition that the amount paid shall be inducted as fresh equity in Vodafone Idea and simultaneously remitted to Indus Towers to clear Vodafone Idea’s outstanding dues.  On Thursday, Vodafone Plc sold 2.4 percent stake in Indus Towers to Bharti Airtel as part of the 4.7 percent deal. Prior to the transaction, Vodafone Plc held 28 percent stake in the tower company while Bharti Airtel had 42 percent stake.  &quot;We believe this transaction allows Airtel to secure continued strong provision of services from Indus Towers, protects and enhances Airtel’s value in Indus Towers, enables it to receive rich dividends and paves the way for subsequent financial consolidation of Indus Towers in Airtel,&quot; Bharti Airtel said.  Also, on Saturday Bharti Airtel shareholders approved the issue of preferential shares to Google for its about Rs 7,500 crore investment in the company to buy 1.28 per cent stake.  Internet giant Google had last month announced the proposed investment which includes equity investment as well as a corpus for potential commercial agreements, to be identified and agreed on mutually agreeable terms over the next five years.  Catch all the market action on our live blog  Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company:  Jefferies  Brokerage firm has kept a buy rating on the stock but cut the target price to Rs 860 from Rs 910 per share.  The decision to acquire 4.7% stake in Indus Towers can be justified financially, but raises questions over its capital allocation.  In the last 15 months, it has invested Rs 8,600 crore for raising stake in Indus and DTH business and it may raise stake in Indus further; this may derate its multiples.  Citi  The research firm has maintained a buy rating on the stock with a target at Rs 875 per share.  Bharti providing exit to Vodafone should enable Vodafone Idea to complete its capital raise and it protect value of Bharti’s holding in Indus.  The additional allocation of capital by Bharti is unlikely to enthuse investors, while attractive acquisition price offers potential for a meaningful return over long term.  CLSA  The broking house has kept a buy rating on the stock with a target at Rs 915 per share.  The deal is divergent to Bharti’s long-term strategy of monetising tower assets.  At 09:18 hrs Bharti Airtel was quoting at Rs 668.80, down Rs 19.65 or 2.85 percent on the BSE.  The key driver for Bharti’s stock remains the India mobile business.

Airtel’s top boss, Vittal, also flagged issues on Right of Way, Services Level Agreement (SLAs) around Bharat Net, as well as challenges related to state-level approvals and subsidy payouts in rural connectivity projects under USO programme, and sought speedy redressal of such impediments.  Telecom connectivity programmes are &quot;right&quot; of every citizen and broadband is at the centre of economic momentum of the country, Vittal said pledging Airtel’s full commitment to making investments, that are needed, to fulfill the vision of Digital India.  Vittal termed backhaul as being &quot;absolutely essential&quot; for broadband infrastructure, and highlighted some &quot;serious struggles&quot; faced by the industry when it comes to both fibre and wireless backhauls.  &quot;E band spectrum is a band of spectrum that can enable large amounts of backhaul from the mobile tower, to carry broadband traffic. Unfortunately, this is spectrum that has been sitting with the government and has not been allocated to the players,” Vittal said.  Terming this &quot;a waste of very precious resource&quot;, he called for finding ways of bundling it with 5G spectrum so that it is available for use in order to build out 5G connectivity.  &quot;I would go so far as to say that if E-band spectrum doesn’t come in, along with the access spectrum on 5G, the 5G game will really be in serious jeopardy,” he cautioned.  Vittal was speaking at post Budget webinar session titled 'Road and Infoway connectivity to all rural habitations'.  Speaking in favour of strengthening of mobile infrastructure in rural areas, Vittal mooted an &quot;idea&quot; for lowering the cost of connectivity.  &quot;One of the ideas that I would like to propose today is to actually take a particular spectrum band, lets say 700 megahertz, and allocate that with very, very stringent obligations to connect the entire country, but do that free of cost…so that we invest the money in the access and the capex rather than in spectrum, and do that with very stringent rollout obligation,” he said.  Vittal observed that USO fund has been leveraged for providing connectivity to many unconnected villages, and added also Airtel too has actively participated in bidding for the tenders.  &quot;But there are two challenges here that I’d like to bring to your notice. One is the complex approvals at the state governments that inhibit the satisfactory rollout of the sites that are part of your vision. And the second part is that even if it’s rolled out, many subsidies are stuck with the government, and the subsidies are not paid out, despite having made these investments,” Vittal informed.  Vittal also batted for open access policy for power so companies can invest in &quot;greening&quot; of the towers.  He also pushed for access to industrial rates of power for a sector like telecom which has become &quot;essential infrastructure&quot;. The session was also attended by Telecom Secretary K Rajaraman.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/airtel-ceo-gopal-vittal-bats-for-giving-out-e-bank-backhaul-spectrum-with-5g-frequencies-8154071.html

AIRTEL,2022-02-14T13:36:59+05:30,Rohith Bhaskar,Explainer | All you need to know about Satellite Broadband and what it means for India,"Satellite Broadband isn't a strange concept to grasp, but does it make sense for India? ","According to a recent report from Morgan Stanley, Satellite Broadband will account for 50 percent of the global space economy by 2040. That number can even rise up to 70 percent in certain scenarios.  The idea is so enticing that Reliance Jio has teamed up with SES, a global satellite provider, to launch broadband services in India. Bharti Airtel, OneWeb and Hughes are also on board.  You may ask yourself what is Satellite Broadband and why is it such a big deal? Let's break it down.  Also Read: Reliance Jio ties up with SES for affordable satellite broadband services  Satellite Broadband: The future of the internet   In the simplest of terms, satellites are objects deliberately put into orbit by humans for several applications. These satellites are used for mapping out space or to take pictures of planets they orbit. That isn't their only purpose though.  There are also satellites that help in communication here on Earth by transmitting and relaying radio signals, weather satellites that monitor the climate of our planet and navigation satellites that help provide positioning information by communicating with a Global Positioning System (GPS).  Satellites will soon be used to provide access to high-speed internet using Geosynchronous Satellites, which means they orbit around Earth at the same speed as the planet's rotation.  This enables them to be at a locked position in space, which is very important since that means they will overlook a fixed position on earth, to which they can transmit and receive data.  These satellites enable high-speed, low-latency internet to be beamed to a receiver on Earth. They now provide access to individual internet plans up to 150 Mbps, which will go up once more satellites are put into orbit.  Also Read: Hughes Communications, Bharti Airtel form JV to offer satellite broadband services in India  Okay. But why is it such a big deal? Don't we currently have wired broadband plans that are faster?   Yes, we do. The answer to that question lies in the question itself, the word 'wired'.  The way it works is that if you want internet coverage in a certain area, you dig up the ground and lay down meters of wire. This is then routed to individual houses and by the end, you are left with a maze of wires and circuits that will be a chore to maintain.  They also limit accessibility, since it is very difficult to dig up and install wires in hilly regions or remote areas with connectivity issues.  With satellite broadband, you are no longer limited in the geographical boundaries you can cover. All you would need is a satellite in space and a receiver on the ground.  Also Read: OneWeb, Hughes sign 6-year pact to provide satellite broadband services in India  Interesting. But are they expensive?   Currently, Yes. Elon Musk's StarLink charges $99 per month for a plan with advertised speeds up to 150 Mbps. You also have to pony up $500 for the equipment which includes a satellite dish and a router.  For more bandwidth, you will have to get the company's premium plan which costs a whopping $500 per month and this is excluding $2,500 for equipment.  Starlink is also planning a launch in India and according to a Business Line report, that maybe as soon as April 2022. They will offer an introductory price of Rs. 1,58,000 for the first year. This includes the Rs. 37,400 for equipment and the Rs. 7,425 monthly fee.  Besides Starlink, Reliance Jio is all set to launch its service in 2022.

As good as it sounds, Satellite broadband is not for everyone. First, the speeds will be slower than fiber connections, so if you have one, you can wait it out till the plans are cheaper or the speeds, faster.  Even standard Cable internet users need not worry, you already have cheaper and faster plans. If the price isn't an issue, then you might want to consider the drawbacks of Satellite Internet.  First, they are limited by extreme weather conditions. At the start, certain providers may also have fair access policies in place, which will limit the amount of speed you have during specific times.  Even if price isn't an issue, you are paying more for slower speeds than fiber or cable connections can provide. That isn't a great deal.  Providers are also likely to feel their way into the market at first, launching plans for enterprises before they move on to serving customers. This is because current pricing trends will not make it viable for most consumers.

AIRTEL,2022-02-11T14:28:50+05:30,Broker Research,Buy Bharti Airtel; target of Rs 910: Sharekhan,"Sharekhan is bullish on Bharti Airtel has recommended buy on the stock with a revised price target (PT) of Rs. 910 in its research report dated February 09, 2022.","Bharti Airtel (Airtel) reported broadly in-line quarterly performance with our expectations, reflecting a healthy operating performance across its key segments. Q3FY2022 saw steady 4G subscriber addition despite tariff hike in the prepaid segment across packs, softer consolidated capex, reduction in net debt, investments by Google, and market share gains across key portfolios. Consolidated revenue increased by 5.4% q-o-q (up 12.6% y-o-y) to Rs. 29,867 crore, led by better growth in India wireless, home, and Africa. Consolidated EBITDA margin improved by ~47 bps q-o-q to 49.2%, in-line with our estimates, led by a 20-bps q-o-q improvement in operating profit margin (OPM) of India wireless and 104-bps q-o-q improvement in Africa. Average revenue per user (ARPU) of India wireless grew by 5.9% to Rs. 162.5 because of prepaid tariff hike (in November 2021). The early sign of tariff hike is encouraging as the decline in overall subscriber in Q3 was lower compared to the last round of tariff hike across the packs in December 2019. However, moderation of subscriber addition could continue in Q4FY2022, given the impact of SIM consolidation. We believe the company would take another round of tariff hike in the second half of CY2022. The company’s continued investments in its five digital layers such as digital infrastructure, digital experience, digital enterprise, digital banking, and digital services are expected to accelerate its growth going ahead. Outlook Airtel is well positioned to drive its revenue growth, given massive investments in digital offerings, market consolidation, new product launches, tariff revision, market share gains across key segments, and relief measures by the government. We believe the tariff increase, improvement in subscriber mix, and strong execution in the non-wireless business are expected to boost the company’s EBITDA at an 18% CAGR over FY2022-FY2024E. At the CMP, the stock is trading at a reasonable valuation of 8x/7x its FY2023E/FY2024E EV/EBITDA. With strategic investments ($1 billion) from Google, rights issue (Rs. 21,000 crore), and healthy operating cash flow generation with tariff hike, we believe Airtel would continue to deleverage its balance sheet going ahead. We continue to prefer Airtel, given healthy free cash flow (FCF) generation, improving subscriber mix, steady EBITDA growth, and strong competitive position. We maintain our Buy recommendation on the stock with a price target (PT) of Rs. 910. At 14:20 hrs Bharti Airtel was quoting at Rs 714.50, down Rs 9.30, or 1.28 percent.

Will it undertake more hikes in 2022?,"There seems to be a massive churn in the mobile landscape, with Bharti Airtel at the losing end of it. Results reveal nearly 28 million users left Airtel in one quarter alone. Increasing competition and recent price hikes have meant that as much as 8.7% of the total user base has logged out in the lastest quarter alone.  The drop in subscriber number shows the price sensitivity of Airtel's user base. The company has embarked on much talked-about price hike during the quarter, and has hinted at more. MD Gopal Vittal told investors after the results, “Tariffs remain abysmally low in India, and another round of price hikes will likely happen in 2022, although it won’t in the next 3-to-4 months as the current SIM consolidation caused by the last round of hikes needs to come down.” The consolidation in the number of mobile SIM cards usually happens when consumers review their service provider after a round of price hikes.

A source, who did not wish to be named, said the primary goal of the preferential share allocation is not influenced by any sort of liability pressure but is inclined towards onboarding a strategic partner aligned with the long-term business objectives of the company.  Jefferies Equity Research, in a report, said Bharti Airtel’s announcement to consider an equity issuance on preferential basis has come as a surprise as there is no immediate need for capital, in its view.  &quot;An issuance to usher in a strategic investor that boosts its enterprise/digital offerings will be seen positively; however, any large acquisitions will be viewed negatively,” the report said.  Bharti Airtel has notified the exchanges that its board will on January 28 consider a proposal for issuance of equity capital through a preferential issue.  However, it did not specify the quantum of the capital raise or its timing.  &quot;The issuance will be to non-promoters implying that promoter stake in the company will get diluted post the potential issue,” Jefferies said.  Bharti Airtel had in December cleared payments for spectrum that it acquired through auction in 2014.  The company paid Rs 15,519 crore to the Department of Telecom for 128.4 MHz spectrum (including Telenor spectrum) that it acquired for Rs 19,051 crore in 2014.  The net debt on the company was about Rs 1.66 lakh crore as on September 30, 2021.  Jefferies said the move comes as a surprise because the company recently made spectrum payments, it can call its pending rights issue capital of Rs 15,700 crore at a month’s notice, recent tariff hikes will boost its cash flows further and there is no visibility of 5G auctions in the near future.  &quot;Given that Bharti’s business does not need capital immediately, a preferential equity issuance could be due to a strategic investor entering Bharti Airtel or an acquisition by Bharti Airtel,” the report said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/bharti-airtel-looking-to-onboard-strategic-investor-through-equity-allocation-report-7983931.html

The government has removed several revenue heads that were part of AGR as well as abolished spectrum usage charges (SUC) on radiowaves that will be purchased in the future auctions as part of the telecom reforms.  &quot;We thank the Government for the recent forward-looking structural and procedural reforms, which we believe will not only bring stability and sustainability to the sector but will also facilitate the digital needs of the citizens. &quot;The telecom industry needs investment in robust and reliable communication infrastructure to meet the rising demand for connectivity. There is an urgent need to reduce the burden of levies on the sector,&quot; COAI Director General S P Kochhar said.  The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) urged the government to bring down licence fees from 3 per cent to 1 per cent and reduce SUC rate by 3 per cent on spectrum acquired in past auctions. &quot;Prevailing license fee is 8 per cent of AGR, which includes a 5 per cent levy for USO Fund.

However, the telecom companies was required to pay interest on these statutory dues during the moratorium period.","Bharti Airtel will not opt for conversion of interest on deferred spectrum and adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues into equity, the telecom operator has informed the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).  “In furtherance to the earlier communication dated October 25, 2021 and in reference to the notification dated October 14, 2021 issued by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to the Company, we wish to inform you that the Company has confirmed to DoT that it will not avail the option of conversion of the interest on deferred spectrum and AGR dues into equity,” Sunil Mittal-led telecom giant said in a regulatory filing.  &quot;The fact that Airtel has opted to pay the dues rather than dilute existing shareholders is a positive and gives us an indication of the improving financial situation of the 2nd largest telco. Although this decision will lead to significant outgo of capital, but it is supported by improving outlook for the sector led by increase in ARPU, upgradation of customers to 4G from 2G. Not having government as a significant shareholder is also a positive in our view,&quot; said Divam Sharma, Co-founder of Green Portfolio, SEBI registered Portfolio Management Services.  As a part of the relief package for the telecom sector, Airtel had opted for the four-year moratorium on AGR and spectrum dues in October 2021. However, the telecom companies were also required to pay interest on these dues during the moratorium period. The DoT, had further given a 90-day window to the telcos to decide if they want to opt for converting the interest amount pertaining to the moratorium period into equity.  &quot;This move hints at the company’s intent to prepay the deferred due early and not dilute the existing shareholders in favor of government equity. This decision is a show of confidence by the company to be able to bear the liabilities early in the future and avoid the interest or equity burden. Investors should welcome this move, but there would be increased scrutiny on execution given that the company has taken this decision now,&quot; said Sonam Srivastava, Founder, Wright Research, SEBI registered investment adviser.  &quot;We are not seeing much price reaction on the news that Bharti Airtel will not avail the option of conversion of the interest on the deferred spectrum and AGR dues into equity. It may lead to an interest burden on an immediate basis however overall it looks positive because there won't be any equity dilution and it also shows the management's confidence about future growth,&quot; said Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart.  &quot;The Telecom sector is looking in a sweet spot today amid weakness in the market where ARPUs have bottomed out, rather we should say that they are on an upward trajectory and the worst is behind us for the sector whereas there are multiple tailwinds to support the future growth. The recent price hike by all the players is a clear indication that there is no price war and the industry is ready for further tariff hikes. The top two players Bharti Airtel and Reliance will remain our preferred bet where Bharti is looking more lucrative than Reliance,&quot; he added.  Reportedly, Bharti Airtel has already paid Rs 18,004 crore in AGR-related dues to telecom department by March 31, 2021, which is more than 10 percent of its total statutory dues of over Rs 43,000 crore.  The Supreme Court's order on 24 October, 2019 ended the 14-year-long dispute over the definition of AGR between the DoT and telecom firms. The DoT argued that telecom companies’ AGR included income from the sale of handsets bundled with services, dividends from subsidiaries, besides other income.

During Q2 FY22, Reliance Jio Infocomm President Kiran Thomas said COVID has been quite tough on a lot of people in India, especially at the bottom of the pyramid.  &quot;During the peak of the second wave, we had done a lot of initiatives… giving free voice minutes to keep them on our network… to keep lifeline alive. But, two quarters later, we find that a large number of people at the bottom of the pyramid have not been able to stay up-to-date with recharges,&quot; Thomas had said. According to the policy, the company kept them in the database for about 90 days.  &quot;So, effectively, the effect of these people stopping recharging two quarters before is now getting reflected in our subscriber count, and because of that, you see a net reduction of about 11 million in this quarter,&quot; Thomas had said. The muted numbers for the two private telcos also echoed on the overall headline wireless tally reported by TRAI for September.  &quot;The total wireless subscribers decreased from 1,186.72 million at the end of August-21 to 1,166.02 million at the end of September-21, thereby registering a monthly decline rate of 1.74 per cent,&quot; it noted.

This has continued to drive FCF, post interest, despite higher capex. The only dampener was the steady rise in net debt, which should fall with rising FCF and proceeds from the rights issue. The management is making the right noise in terms of steady market share gains, premiumization, cross selling through digital initiatives, and healthy inroads in non-Mobile revenue streams like payments bank, Home, and Enterprise segments. It expects 20% consolidated EBITDA CAGR over FY21-23E, along with tariff/consolidation to drive FCF/deleveraging. We maintain our Buy rating.  Outlook We see potential for a re-rating in both the India and Africa businesses on the back of steady earnings growth. We value Bharti on a Sep’22E basis, assigning an EV/EBITDA of 11x/5x to the India Mobile/Africa business, arriving at an SoTP-based TP of INR860. Our estimates do not factor in any upside from a tariff hike or steep market share gains from VIL’s financial stress. We maintain our Buy rating.

AIRTEL,2021-11-04T12:13:38+05:30,Pallavi Pengonda,"Growth stocks: High on valuations, but higher on returns","These stocks may be a tad expensive, but they could easily live up to those valuations and deliver returns.","Growth stocks are shares of companies that are expected to potentially see faster growth in revenues and earnings versus the average industry or market growth. Now, unlike value stocks, growth stocks typically trade at higher valuations comparatively as the market tries to capture the anticipated growth potential.  With the easing of restrictions and revival of the economy, growth prospects look bright for a whole range of sectors. Here we pick three stocks: one is a play on the India consumption story; the second is a story of deepening penetration for a product that literally offers life cover; and third is a bet on changing industry dynamics and gaining back of pricing power when most consumer companies may be struggling to raise prices. SBI Life Insurance Co Shares of India’s largest private life insurer, SBI Life Insurance Co Ltd, have risen around 30 percent so far in 2021. Investors have taken note of the firm’s superior performance metrics. Brokerage target prices for the stock indicate that there is more upside left. SBI Life has a strong distribution network of 200,190 trained insurance professionals across 947 offices in the country. Plus, the firm has strong parentage and low-cost structure, which augurs well. Analysts see scope for margin improvement in future. “Strong APE (annualised premium equivalent) growth driven by ULIP, non-par savings and protection segment along with improving margins (better persistency, cost-efficiency and product mix) should continue to drive VNB (value of new business) growth over medium term in our view,” points out a report from PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. Ltd on October 27. For the September quarter (Q2FY22), SBI Life saw healthy acceleration in business momentum led by ULIPs, protection and non-par savings. Note that there was 1.49 times increase in the number of claims reported from Q1FY22 to Q2FY22 for SBI Life. SBI Life’s COVID claims are expected to moderate ahead. “Stress on margin improvement as a strategy, guidance on increase in non-par mix, and launch of new protection product has set up strong expectations for H2FY22,” ICICI Securities Ltd said. Bharti Airtel A strong growth outlook, thanks to market share gains, makes Bharti Airtel Ltd a good bet in the Indian telecom sector. The government’s relief package announced in September ensured three private firms in the Indian telecom industry, for now. Airtel benefits from the telecom measures, albeit to a lesser extent than Vodafone Idea Ltd. Further, investors await potential tariff hikes, the next big trigger for the Airtel stock. “We believe Bharti is well-hedged to gain from any move towards either market consolidation (duopoly) or market repair (sharp tariff hikes, further relief measures) in the India wireless business,” said analysts from Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt Ltd in a report on October 29. “Bharti’s rights issue (Rs 21,000 crore), cashflow relief from the moratorium on government dues (about Rs 48,000 crore), along with over Rs20,000 crore in annual free cashflow generation over FY21-25, not only abates debt concerns, but also ensures that Bharti would be well-placed to compete with R-Jio in the upcoming 5G rollouts.” Having said that, more-than-expected delays in tariff hikes could be a dampener for investor sentiment. Bharti Airtel saw a quarter-on-quarter increase in its net debt as on September 30, owing to an increase in deferred payment liability. But leverage is manageable, point out analysts. Net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio stands at around 3 times. Westlife Development Ltd Westlife Development, the operator of McDonald’s, is a play on the consumption story. With the easing of COVID-related restrictions, this quick-service restaurant made a strong recovery in the second quarter led by 95 percent recovery in per-store revenues and 2 percent in addition to store count. The September recovery was even stronger at 103 percent, surpassing pre-COVID levels. Better recovery has been led by a strong 70 percent growth in the convenience channel, while dine-in recovery was 60-65 percent, both compared to Q2FY20 levels.  Inflationary pressures on commodities impacted the gross and EBITDA margins. Gross margins were up 120 bps on a YoY basis but declined 70 bps from previous quarter to 64.7 percent. Restaurant Operating Margin (ROM) stood at 17.4 percent as against 3.7 percent in 2QFY21. The EBITDA margin stood at 11.5 percent compared to -0.6 percent in the same quarter last year. This was about 200 bps lower than the EBITDA margins that the company earned between the period after Lockdown 1 and before Lockdown 2. But the continued sales momentum would drive operational leverage and result in margin expansion in the future. The company has raised its expansion targets and now expects to double its store network in the next 3-5 years with a capital investment of Rs 800-1,000 crore. “The company is well placed to capitalise on the COVID-led accelerated shift towards organised players with strong emphasis being laid on menu-innovation, network expansion and digital/omni channels,” Emkay Research said. The large penetration opportunity, increased pace of expansion and margin gains keep us optimistic, it said. “We remain optimistic about the medium-term opportunity for WLDL, especially after the lifting of the COVID-related restrictions,” said Motilal Oswal.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/growth-stocks-high-on-valuations-but-higher-on-returns-7678201.html

Vittal spoke of a recent case where a cyber-fraudster posing as company executive called up an Airtel customer on the pretext of updating his Know Your Customer (KYC) form, tricked him into revealing his bank details and transferred a large sum of money from his bank account.  &quot;Unfortunately, such instances of cyber fraud are now becoming alarmingly frequent. So, I urge you to be vigilant,” Vittal said.  Common instances of fraud include fake UPI handles and websites and fake OTPs, he informed.  &quot;There are several fake UPI apps and ecommerce websites which appear authentic in design through the usage of NPCI, BHIM words and logos. If you download one of these, you will be asked to enter all your bank details as well as your MPIN thereby granting the fraudster in question complete access to your bank details,” Vittal wrote.  Elaborating on the modus operandi for fake OTPs, he explained that a fraudster calls the customer claiming to be from a bank/financial institution and asks for account details or an OTP to unblock/renew the existing bank account.  The details are then used to withdraw money from the customer’s bank account.  Vittal also listed out precautions to safeguard against these frauds, advising customers not to share any financial or personal information like your customer ID, MPIN, OTP over the phone, SMS or email.  Safety measures detailed out also asked users not to follow instructions in any SMS sent from an untrusted source; deleting such SMSes instantly; not opening suspicious websites and apps nor fall prey to unbelievable offers or prices on such sites.  Do not share your personal and financial information with unknown apps claiming to be UPI apps, Vittal said, also urging users not to provide any confidential information via email or click on any suspicious link, even if the request seems to be from authorities like the Income Tax Department, Visa or MasterCard, and others.  &quot;Do not open unexpected email attachments or instant message download links. Additionally, installing antivirus software will help. It scans every file you download and protects you from malicious files,” he informed customers.  Vittal also suggested using 'Airtel Safe Pay' describing it as a &quot;very sound way&quot; to avoid fraud.  Airtel Safe Pay is the safest method of paying online in the country, and provides an additional layer of security for every transaction, he said.  &quot;In other words, before you actually make a payment, our network intelligence throws up a message asking you to confirm the transaction. And the money only leaves your account once we have received your approval, thereby ensuring you are not vulnerable to fraudsters,” he wrote.  To be on Airtel Safe Pay, users need to open an Airtel Payments bank account.  &quot;These are uncertain times and cybercrime is on the rise. So, I urge you therefore to pay heed and proceed with care,” he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/telecom/airtel-ceo-warns-users-about-cyber-fraud-cases-becoming-alarmingly-frequent-7636421.html

However, the TDSAT notice did not specify any reason. The Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) bench headed by Justice Shiv Kirti Singh had on October 12, listed the matter for hearing on October 26, and had asked to not encash the bank guarantee &quot;till the next date&quot;.  As per the Department of Telecom (DoT), companies were required to pay the penalty by October 21. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea moved the telecom tribunal to challenge the Telecom Department’s demand notices for payment of Rs 3,050 crore cumulative penalties in the points of interconnect matter.  DoT had slapped a penalty of Rs 2,000 crore on Vodafone Idea and Rs 1,050 crore on Bharti Airtel based on sector regulator Trai’s recommendation five years ago, for violating norms by denying Reliance Jio points of interconnect (PoIs) way back in 2016.  The PoI are required to interconnect networks of telecom operators. Lawyers representing Vodafone Idea had argued that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) recommended a penalty based on just one day reading of quality of service data and even did not average it over the period of 30 days as per the norms.  In October 2016, Trai had recommended imposing a total penalty of Rs 3,050 crore on Airtel, Vodafone and Idea (now merged) for allegedly denying inter-connectivity to Reliance Jio.  The regulator had, at that time, stopped short of recommending cancellation of their telecom licences saying it may lead to significant consumer inconvenience.  Trai’s recommendation had come on a complaint by Reliance Jio that over 75 per cent of calls on its network were failing as incumbents were not releasing sufficient numbers of PoIs.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/bharti-airtel-vodafone-idea-penalty-case-tdsat-says-no-hearing-today-7630551.html
AIRTEL,2021-10-25T21:58:56+05:30,PTI,"Bharti Airtel accepts 4-year moratorium on spectrum, AGR payments",Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal had last month said the company will opt for payment moratorium and redirect the cashflow to aggressively build networks.  ,"Bharti Airtel on Monday said it will opt for four-year payments moratorium -- on AGR and spectrum dues -- being offered by the government as part of a relief package for the telecom sector.  The other option offered in the Department of Telecom's notification would be considered by the company within the stipulated timelines, Airtel said in a regulatory filing.  &quot;...we wish to inform you that the company has confirmed to avail the following options...deferment of the payment of spectrum auction instalments due up to four years; and deferment of AGR related dues by a period of four years with immediate effect,&quot; Airtel said in the BSE filing. Sources said Airtel had communicated its decision to the telecom department on Friday.  On the option for converting the interest amount (of moratorium period) into equity, companies still have ample time to convey their decision, a source pointed out.  In line with the bold reforms unveiled for the telecom sector, the government recently wrote to telcos including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio asking them to convey by October 29 if they would be opting for the four-year dues moratorium.  Telcos have also been given 90 days time to indicate if they want to opt for converting the interest amount pertaining to the moratorium period, into equity.  Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal had last month said the company will opt for payment moratorium and redirect the cashflow to aggressively build networks.  With regard to interest dues on payment moratorium, Mittal had said Airtel will take a decision, when the offer comes from the government, on whether to go for equity conversion mechanism or pay cash.  The company's board will take a decision at that point, Mittal had said adding that with interest component working out to Rs 7,500- 10,000 crore, the stake involved may work out to 2-3 per cent, in case the company opted for it.  The moratorium will free up cashflow to the extent of Rs 40,000 crore and that amount is sufficient to meet the market's requirements, he had said.  Vodafone Idea, last week, said it will avail the four-year spectrum payment moratorium. VIL had further stated that other options offered in the telecom department's notification will be considered by the board of directors within the set timeframe.  According to the letter sent to the telcos, the government has offered the option to defer payment of the spectrum auction instalments due up to four years, with immediate effect, excluding the instalments due for spectrum auction 2021. This option is applicable from FY 2022-23 to FY 2025-26.  These deferred amounts will be spread equally over the remaining instalments to be paid, without any increase in the existing time period specified for making the instalment payments.  Interest as stipulated in the relevant year of auction of spectrum will, however, be charged so that the Net Present Value (NPV) of the payable amount is protected.  &quot;Option for converting the interest amount, arising out of protection of NPV on account of deferred spectrum dues, pertaining to the moratorium period, by way of equity, shall be exercised within 90 days of this notification,&quot; the DoT letter to telcos had said.  The letter had also spelt out the fine print related to modalities for converting interest amount into equity.  The method of arriving at the price and valuation for equity conversion of interest dues is different for listed and unlisted companies.  One of the letters issued by DoT to a listed company had mentioned that equity shares would be issued by the company to the government on preferential basis. It went on to add that the NPV of the interest amount will be calculated as on the date of exercise of option.  The interest amount will continue to be treated as a loan to companies till the completion of the equity infusion process, DoT had said.  Besides the four-year break to companies from paying statutory dues, the relief package for the sector includes permission to share scarce airwaves, change in the definition of revenue on which levies are paid and 100 per cent foreign investment through the automatic route.  The measures, aimed at providing relief to companies such as Vodafone Idea that have to pay thousands of crores in unprovisioned past statutory dues, also include the scrapping of Spectrum Usage Charge (SUC) for airwaves acquired in future spectrum auctions.

All sectors, barring PSU Bank, closed in red with auto, FMCG, metal and pharma losing up to 2 percent. The broader markets were hit hard, with the Nifty midcap and smallcap indices falling over 2 percent each.  Some stocks, however, outperformed the market including telecom operator Bharti Airtel rallied 4.02 percent to close at Rs 708.45 and was the biggest Nifty50 gainer.  The country's largest lender State Bank of India was the second biggest Nifty gainer, crossing the Rs 500-mark for the first time before closing with 2.4 percent gains at Rs 499.90. Metropolis Healthcare was also in action despite correction in broader markets, rising 5.73 percent to close at Rs 2,907.55.  Paras Defence and Space Technologies, which surged 66 percent in four straight sessions, was locked in 10 percent upper circuit at Rs 990.40 on October 20.  Here's what Gaurav Sharma of Globe Capital Markets says investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Bharti Airtel  The stock has recently posted fresh breakout from Rs 680-700 levels in which it was trading from past two weeks. A recent news flash reveals that the company has managed to add good number of customers in the month of September. This is quite positive news.  This up move is back by above average volume, indicating buyers' interest at current levels. Hence, we advocate buying it at current market price (Rs 708.45) for targets close to Rs 750-770 in the immediate near term. Traders must maintain stop loss below Rs 670.    State Bank of India  PSU Banks have performed quite well in the recent past and so did SBI. It went past psychological hurdle of Rs 500 in day trade on October 20, which in itself is quite a positive development.  Going by its short as well as medium term charts, we see it heading northwards in coming sessions as well, Rs 525-540 are the immediate upside targets that we are eyeing at. Short term traders are advised to keep stop loss below Rs 475.    Metropolis Healthcare  This stock is consolidating in range Rs 2,600 to Rs 3,200 from past two months. As of now, there are no concrete signs as to which side the stock is headed in the immediate near term, but an either side break from the above mentioned range will lead to Rs 300 to Rs 400 points move in that direction.    Paras Defence and Space Technologies  This stock got listed on the October 1 at Rs 469 and has been hitting higher highs since then and has more than doubled in less than two-month time.  As its data is too less to assess it on basis on charts; hence, providing a short term outlook is not possible. But, going by basis of the market, such steep rise is generally not sustainable. Hence, traders should keep trailing stoploss with every rise.  As of now, we recommend to maintain stop loss below Rs 800.

It has also given 90 days’ time to the operators to indicate if they want to opt for converting the interest amount pertaining to the moratorium period into equity.  Along with this option, the audited financial statements of the immediately preceding financial year (2020-21) may be submitted, according to a letter seen by PTI.  The letters were sent by the Department of Telecom on Friday to individual players, and between them, the content and procedural modalities outlined vary slightly at places.  Recently, the government approved a blockbuster relief package for the telecom sector that includes a four-year break for companies from paying statutory dues, permission to share scarce airwaves, change in the definition of revenue on which levies are paid and 100 percent foreign investment through the automatic route.  The measures, aimed at providing relief to companies such as Vodafone Idea that have to pay thousands of crores in unprovisioned past statutory dues, also include the scrapping of Spectrum Usage Charge (SUC) for airwaves acquired in future spectrum auctions.  For the past dues, the government has allowed a moratorium or deferment of up to four years in annual payments. But the telecom companies will have to pay interest during the moratorium period.  Also, the government will have an option to convert the due amount pertaining to the deferred payment into equity at the end of the moratorium/deferment period.  It has also given an option to the telcos to pay the interest amount arising due to the said deferment of payment by way of equity.  Last month, Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal said the company will opt for the payment moratorium offered in the telecom relief package and redirect the cash flow to aggressively build networks.

AIRTEL,2021-10-17T13:12:17+05:30,PTI," Subscriber additions to drive Reliance Jio's Q2 show; tariff hikes to aid Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea:...","The urgency around tariff hikes has come down with Vodafone Idea Ltd's (VIL) near-term cash outflow significantly reduced, IIFL Securities said.","The second quarter of the fiscal is likely to be a ''healthy quarter'' for telecom companies, where Jio's performance will be driven by subscriber additions, and Bharti and Vodafone Idea will benefit from tariffs hikes and some recovery post-severe wave of COVID-19, according to some analysts.  The urgency around tariff hikes has come down with Vodafone Idea Ltd's (VIL) near-term cash outflow significantly reduced, IIFL Securities said.  ''Second quarter is likely to be a healthy quarter for telcos, though the drivers would be different for Jio and other players,'' IIFL Securities said in a recent note.  It expects Bharti to ''marginally outperform'' Jio on sequential India mobile revenue growth.  ''Jio's revenue growth is likely to be entirely driven by subscriber adds, while Bharti and Vi would benefit from partial impact from tariff hikes (both pre-paid and post-paid) taken in July and some bounce-back post the pandemic related headwinds in 1Q (first quarter),'' it said.  The report forecast five percent and four percent quarter-on-quarter Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth for Jio and Bharti consolidated and anticipated that VIL and Indus could see flat Ebitda.  ''With the relief package reducing the urgency around tariff hikes, we now build-in significant price increases only in 2H 2022 versus early 2022 previously,'' it said.  As per Jefferies' report, telcos Reliance Jio and Bharti may post a 5-7 percent sequential rise in revenue alongside a steady margin for the second quarter of FY22.  Bharti's growth will be led by segmented tariff hikes taken in the second quarter ended September, while Jio's growth will be driven by continued subscriber growth, it further said.  Credit Suisse, in its earnings preview note, said that 2Q FY22 is expected to mark higher subscriber churn and 4.5-6 percent sequential average revenue per user (ARPU) growth for Airtel and VIL over actions on the minimum recharge plans and some recovery after the impact from the second wave of COVID-19 in the first quarter of FY22.  ''For Airtel, we expect revenue market share gains to continue, with India mobile revenue growth of 4.2 percent quarter on quarter, on the back of 4.5 percent QoQ (quarter-on-quarter) ARPU growth offset by 0.6 percent QoQ decline in subscriber base...,'' it said.  It expects Vodafone Idea Ltd to report a second consecutive quarter of 10 million-plus subscriber loss on higher churn and SIM consolidation.  ''Thus, despite a 6 percent QoQ ARPU growth, we estimate revenue growth to be muted at 1.6 percent QoQ (-13.8 percent year on year),'' Credit Suisse note said.  In the case of Vodafone Idea, the key aspects to watch out for will be quantum and visibility of fundraising and the company's strategy to ringfence lower ARPU subscribers from affordable smartphone launch by Jio and cashback by Airtel.  India, the world's second-largest telecom market and the biggest consumer of data, has three private players -- Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea -- besides the state-owned operators BSNL/MTNL.  Amid an existential crisis faced by VIL, the government recently approved a blockbuster relief package for the sector that includes a four-year break for companies from paying statutory dues, permission to share scarce airwaves, change in the definition of revenue on which levies are paid, and 100 percent foreign investment through the automatic route.

Put simply, 5G is the next-generation network technology that enables connecting virtually everyone and everything together including machines, objects, and devices at ultra-high speeds and responsiveness, and with low latency.  &quot;5G will be a transformational technology when it comes to delivering broadband coverage to the last mile through use cases like FWA and contribute to a more inclusive digital economy,&quot; Randeep Singh Sekhon, Airtel CTO said at a virtual event.  Nunzio Mirtillo, Head of Ericsson South east Asia, Oceania and India said 5G will serve as a &quot;socio-economic multiplier&quot; for the country.  As per a study by Ericsson, on an average, a 10 per cent increase in the mobile broadband adoption ratio causes a 0.8 per cent increase in GDP, Mirtillo noted.  Over the past few months, Bharti Airtel and Ericsson have teamed up to showcase enhanced speeds of more than 1Gbps on a live 5G network set up at Cyber Hub in Gurugram using Bharti’s 3,500 MHz trial spectrum.  In January this year, the two companies also showcased Ericsson Spectrum Sharing capabilities on a commercially deployed installed base of 1800 MHz liberalised frequencies in Hyderabad to give consumers their first experience of 5G from a live commercial network.

The DoT has given three weeks time to the telecom operators to pay the penalty, a source said while sharing the content of the demand notice served to the companies on Thursday.  When contacted Bharti Airtel spokesperson said, “We are deeply disappointed with the arbitrary and unfair demand based on Trai recommendations of 2016 relating to provisions of point of interconnect to a new operator.

The regulator had, at that time, stopped short of recommending cancellation of their telecom licences saying it may lead to significant consumer inconvenience.  Trai's recommendation had come on a complaint by Reliance Jio that over 75 per cent of calls on its network were failing as incumbents were not releasing sufficient numbers of points of interface (PoIs).

What should investors do?,"The relief package eases the financial stress for telcos and frees up funds that can be deployed to build 5G infrastructure and acquire spectrum, experts said.","The four-year moratorium on payment of adjusted gross revenue dues as part of the government’s measures to address the liquidity requirements of telecom companies offers big savings in terms of cashflow for Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, experts said.  The Union Cabinet approved the moratorium and other measures along with structural and procedural reforms for the struggling telecom sector on September 15.  The steps taken include rationalisation of interest rates on delayed payment of licence fees and spectrum usage fees and the scrapping of penalties and interest on penalties. Additionally, non-telecom revenue will be excluded while calculating AGR, offering major financial relief to telcos.  “Overall, it is very positive news for the telecom sector. Both Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel will benefit because they owe the government the most,” said Gaurav Garg, head of research at CapitalVia Global Research.  “It is a good relief for telecom companies and it is beneficial for Bharti Airtel and Vodafone as they don’t have to pay interest for the next four years,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, director at IIFL Securities. “It is also more credible for banks, which have given loans. Stocks are fully valued now and this news is already priced in.”  For Vodafone, it is “a big relief and well-structured deal,” although the company is demanding more relief measures, he said.  Telecom operators, already burdened with debt, faced additional stress after the Supreme Court ordered them in October 2019 to pay Rs 1,19,292 crore to the Department of Telecommunications as AGR dues. Bharti Airtel’s dues were Rs 43,980 crore and Vodafone Idea owed Rs 58,254 crore.  In September 2020, the Supreme Court allowed the telcos to stagger the payment of AGR dues, including penalty, interest, and interest on penalty, over 10 years through March 31, 2031. Vodafone Idea has already paid Rs 7,854 crore and Bharti Airtel Rs 18,000 crore as AGR dues.  Bharti Airtel shares gained 4.5 percent to Rs 725.55 at the close on the BSE on September 15. Vodafone Idea climbed 2.76 percent to Rs 8.93. Vodafone has rallied 47 percent this month on expectations of a telecom relief package.  “It is helpful for survival, at least in the case of Vodafone (which has been losing subscribers), though a lot of things need to be done on the government front to have three players in the telecom sector,” said Siddhartha Khemka, head - retail research, at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.  Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are the only three private telecom operators in the country.  The reforms are “definitely a positive step” for telecom stocks like Vodafone and Bharti Airtel because they have a lot of savings in terms of cashflow, he said.  “Capex is a bigger challenge for these companies and they have to invest a lot for technology. The government has given a bloodline for Vodafone, which has been facing a huge debt burden,” Khemka said.  The other major beneficiaries are banks that advanced loans to the telcos, including IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank. Their shares gained almost 2 percent.  “A four-year moratorium on dues of the telecom sector which covers AGR, spectrum dues and interest payments will bring big relief to the cash-strapped sector. This is positive for banks, too, since banks’ exposure will decline significantly,” said VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services. “Allowing 100 percent FDI in telecom and redefining AGR to exclude non-core revenue are welcome steps that can stimulate investment.”  Aprajita Saxena, a research analyst at Trustline Securities, said it was beneficial for IndusInd Bank, which had advanced Rs 3,300 crore to Vodafone, and Yes Bank, which lent Rs 300-400 crore to Vodafone.  “These banks also have exposure to Bharti Airtel,” Saxena said.  She said the money saved due to the moratorium can be used to set up and maintain telecom infrastructure and to buy 5G spectrum at the upcoming auction.  “Also, it will support their balance sheets. The news also sends the message that India is an investor-friendly nation to global companies,” Saxena said.  Garg of CapitalVia said the package frees up funds that can be used to fuel investments, especially in 5G technology.  “The government’s work in putting together a telecom package is intended to prevent the telecom sector from becoming a duopoly. These are possible actions that will pave the path for reform in this area,” he said.  Vodafone Idea’s gross debt, excluding lease liabilities and including interest accrued but not due, was Rs 1,91,590 crore as of June 30, 2021. Deferred spectrum payment obligations stood at Rs 1,06,010 crore and AGR dues at Rs 62,180 crore.  What should investors do?  “Investors who have already added these stocks to their portfolios may hold them for long-term capital gain as these moves may have an influence that will be felt in the next 2-3 years,” said Garg.  Rahul Sharma, cofounder of Equity99, advised investors to stay invested in the sector.  “We are highly bullish on this sector after such a move by the government,” he said. “Bharti Airtel is our top pick, with Vodafone Idea and Indus Tower.”  Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

AIRTEL,2021-09-15T18:57:32+05:30,Nisha Poddar,Cabinet approves four-year moratorium on telecom company dues in a boost for Vodafone Idea,"The government made a raft of structural changes to offer relief to the embattled telecom industry and announced a four-year moratorium on payment of adjusted gross revenue and spectrum dues to help companies, in particular Vodafone Idea, to manage cash flows. The moratorium comes with a Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR) + 2 percent, making it revenue-neutral for the government.","The federal cabinet offered the telecom industry a four-year moratorium on Wednesday on payment of adjusted gross revenue and spectrum dues starting on October 1, throwing a reprieve to debt-laden entities, particularly Vodafone Idea Limited, and give them a chance to better manage cash flows in the interim.  To encourage investment, 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) under the automatic route was permitted in the telecom sector by the cabinet, the government said in an announcement welcomed by the top two industry players as a boost to the Digital India initiative.  The government made it clear that the moratorium will carry an interest burden of the marginal cost of funds based lending rate, or MCLR, + 2 percent, making it revenue- neutral for the exchequer. All relief measures are prospective in nature.  ALSO READ: Cabinet approves moratorium of four years for telcos to pay AGR dues  The announcement of a raft of structural changes is particularly welcome for Vodafone India, whose annual AGR dues are estimated at Rs. 8,000 crore and annual spectrum dues at 16,000 crore by analysts.  With the additional interest burden, estimates suggest that around Rs 2000 crore of finance charges will be added to Vodafone Idea’s annual interest payments because of the relief offered by the government.  AGR is the spectrum usage and licensing fee that telecom operators are charged by the Department of Telecommunications, or DoT. (MCLR) is the minimum lending rate below which a bank is not allowed to lend money to its customers.  If business prospects improve and tariffs increase, the relief may prove to be a game changer for Vodafone Idea, said analyst Naveen Kulkarni of Axis Securities Limited.  Nitin Soni, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, made light of the relief. “It’s a minor relief and not a life-saving measure for Vodafone Idea,” said Soni.  Vodafone Idea under stress:  Soni noted that Vodafone Idea was losing subscribers and may lose still more, which will make the interest burden difficult to service for the company. It will also not be able to commit any capital expenditure to spur growth, he said.  Many industry experts say the relief measure have been designed by the government to avoid a potential duopoly in the telecom sector.  Vodafone Idea has been struggling to survive in a difficult business environment and cope with the added burden of AGR dues worth Rs 58,254 crore assessed by DoT.  Vodafone Idea’s debt stands at Rs 1.8 lakh crore, which includes spectrum obligations amounting to Rs 94,200 crore.  Focus on spectrum auctions:  The cabinet also announced some path-breaking measures for the spectrum auctions. The government has come up with a spectrum auction calendar, offering telecom companies certainty of the timing of sales and a chance to plan in advance. Spectrum auction will be held in the last quarter of the financial year.  In future auctions, the tenure of spectrum was increased from 20 to 30 years. A surrender of the airwaves will be permitted after 10 years of being acquired in future auctions.  No spectrum usage charge (SUC) will be levied for airwaves acquired in future spectrum auctions. Spectrum sharing was encouraged with the removal of an additional SUC of 0.5% for such sharing.  ALSO READ: Cabinet approves major reforms in telecom sector, here are key highlights  The National Democratic Alliance government is banking on the upcoming 5G spectrum auctions to raise money. Relief for the telecom companies ties will boost their ability to participate in the auctions.  Moneycontrol had earlier reported that top banks had written to the government for a reconsideration of the AGR dues, especially Vodafone Idea’s, to provide comfort to the lenders to fund telecom companies to participate in the auctions.  Banks have not been comfortable with their exposure to the telecom sector at a time when one of the three private entities was struggling to manage its cash flows.  More telecom reforms:  Out of the nine structural changes announced by the government, five are procedural for ease of doing business.  The cabinet also cleared the new AGR definition, which has been changed to exclude non-telecom revenues. Telcos will not be charged interest on interest and penalty on dues. Interest will be charged on an annual basis compared to monthly earlier.  In other measures, the cabinet approved simplification and digitisation of processes in telecom tower set-ups, and gave its assent for equipment purchases and customer acquisitions.  Under the Make in India initiative, 4G and 5G technology to be designed and developed in India will receive additional focus. The technologies can even be exported in the future.  VI's response:  “The pathbreaking reforms announced by the government today will go a long way in unshackling the telecom sector. These reforms demonstrate the government’s firm commitment to ensuring healthy growth of the industry. The measures also reflect the decisiveness of the Prime Minister, the Telecom Minister, and the government to address long-standing issues. These reforms will bring alive the digital aspirations of 1.3 billion people and accelerate India’s journey to be a digitally powered economy as envisaged by our Honorable Prime Minister,” Aditya Birla Group's Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said in a statement.  “We commend the resolve shown by the Government of India, under PM Modi’s leadership, to find a comprehensive solution that would support a competitive and sustainable telecom sector in India,&quot; Vodafone Group's CEO Nick Read said.  &quot;Although the sector has struggled for many years, we expect that the government’s constructive initiative announced today - along with the continued strong support of the Telecom Minister and Finance Minister - will be the beginning of a new era for India’s digital ambitions and for VI’s continued contribution to creating an inclusive and sustainable digital society to the benefit of all citizens,&quot; added Nick Read.  What Lies Ahead?  Tariff hikes are, of course, critical but whether or not the relief package reassures equity investors to fund Vodafone Idea will be the real measure of its efficacy.  Reliance Industries Limited chairman Mukesh D. Ambani said in a statement: “Telecom sector is one of the prime movers of the economy and the key enabler for making India a Digital Society, I welcome the Government of India’s announcement of reforms and relief measures that will enable the industry to achieve the goals of Digital India. I thank Hon. Prime Minister for this bold initiative.”  Sunil Bharti Mittal, Chairman, Bharti Airtel Limited, said: “We congratulate and thank the Government, which under the decisive leadership of the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has undertaken these seminal reforms to lift an industry that’s at the core of his Digital India vision. The latest reforms ensure that the industry is able to invest fearlessly and support India’s digital ambitions. We also compliment the Hon’ble Minister of Communications and the Hon’ble Finance Minister for their leadership and support.”  “Bharti Airtel is fully committed to respond to the call by the Hon’ble Prime Minister to invest in and accelerate India’s growth. What lies ahead is a once in a lifetime opportunity to build the digital infrastructure that is a catalyst for the digital aspirations of over one billion Indians.” added Sunil Bharti Mittal.

AIRTEL,2021-09-15T15:35:13+05:30,Shreeja Singh,Cabinet approves moratorium of four years for telcos to pay AGR dues,The decision is expected to offer interim cash flow relief to the sector where two of the three largest private telcos are saddled with dues.,"In a big relief to the debt-strapped telcos - Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, the Cabinet on September 15 announced a moratorium of four years for the payment of the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues.   The announcement is a part of the big bang relief package for the telecom sector that includes nine structural reforms and five process reforms.  The four year moratorium also extends to other telecom dues such as the due payments of spectrum purchased in the past auctions except the recently concluded auctions earlier this year.  The deferment is protected by an interest component, which the telecom companies will have to pay right from the first day of the commencement of the moratorium period from October 1, at the rate of MCLR plus 2 percent.  The decision by the Cabinet has come just weeks after Kumar Mangalam Birla resigned as chairman of the loss making Vodafone Idea on August 4.  The Supreme Court had in October 2019 mandated that telecom operators pay Rs 1,19,292 crore to the Department of Telecommunications as AGR dues. Of this, Bharti Airtel’s dues are pegged at Rs 43,980 crore, while Vodafone Idea’s dues were Rs 58,254 crore.  However, later in September 2020, the Supreme Court had granted 10 years to the operators to make staggered payments of the AGR dues, including penalty, interest and interest on penalty through March 31, 2031.   Vodafone Idea, promoted by Aditya Birla Group and UK’s Vodafone Group, has paid Rs 7854 crore as AGR dues, meanwhile Bharti Airtel has paid Rs 18,000 crore as AGR dues.   Both Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have been trying to get their AGR dues reduced through legal means but so far all their efforts have failed. In fact, the telcos had even moved a review petition for a July order by the Supreme Court which had junked their pleas for recalculation of their AGR liabilities saying that there have been arithmetical errors on the part of the telecom department in calculating the dues.   The definition of AGR, which had been a major bone of contention for the sector has been rationalised by excluding non-telecom revenue of telecom companies on prospective basis.  Telecom Minister Ashwini Vaishnav said, &quot;PM Modi took a bold decision over AGR today. A decision has been taken to rationalise the definition of AGR. All non-telecom revenue will be taken out of AGR. There was a regime of heavy interest, penalty &amp;amp; interest on penalty on payment of license fees, spectrum user charges and all kinds of charges. It has been rationalised today.&quot;    Announcements related to Spectrum   The Minister also announced increasing the tenure of spectrum license to 30 years from 20 years presently for the future auctions.  There will also be no Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC)  for spectrum acquired in the future auctions and the additional SUC charges for spectrum sharing have also been removed, the telecom minister announced.  The government will also allow companies to surrender spectrum after paying a surrender charge with a lock in period of 10 years.  The minister also said that a a spectrum auction calendar will be made for proper planning by the industry.  Other Announcements   A 100 per cent FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) in telecom via the automatic route was also approved by the Cabinet.  The Cabinet also approved the simplification of the KYC norms for the customers and a single window clearance through Department of Telecommunications (DOT) portal for setting up of telecom towers.  To facilitate ease of doing business for the industry, the telecom minister said that the 1953 Customs Notification for wireless equipment removed to enable easier purchase of telecom equipment by the telecom operators.  Vaishnav also said that presently over 300-400 crore customer acquisition forms are lying in the warehouses of the Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) will now be stored in a digital format.  Telecom Minister said that the relief package is applicable to the entire industry and not just any particular company, however added that telecom companies already going through the insolvency process would need to get clarity from NCLT courts.  Addressing the briefing telecom minister also said that should be a healthy competition in the sector and noted that there will be further reforms when 5G is auctioned so that more players would enter the sector.  He also added that the reforms announced are revenue neutral to the government.  &quot;The reforms are expected to generate employment opportunities, promote healthy competition, protect interests of consumers, infuse liquidity, encourage investment and reduce regulatory burden on Telecom Service Providers (TSPs),&quot; the government said in a statement.  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cabinet-approves-moratorium-of-four-years-for-telcos-to-pay-agr-dues-7470291.html

The reason is a cabinet meeting scheduled on September 8 to consider a relief package for the financially stressed telcos, according to a Business Standard report, which cited unidentified government officials.  &amp;nbsp;  “As part of the package, there could be some relaxation on payment of levies to the government, including a one-year moratorium on spectrum instalment due in April 2022,” the report said.  “Telecom stocks are rallying for the past two days ahead of the cabinet meeting as there is an expectation of announcement of a relief package for the sector,” said Santosh Meena, head of research at Swastika Investmart. “If there is an announcement related to that, then it will be a positive trigger for the entire telecom sector as well as for some banking stocks like IDFC First Bank, IndusInd Bank and State Bank of India.”  Bharti Airtel hit a fresh high of Rs 684 on the BSE on September 8, gaining about 30 percent in two months. The stock fell 0.5 percent to Rs 666.80 at 13:20 hrs.  Vodafone Idea has advanced 48 percent so far in September amid expectations of getting some relief from the government. The shares gained 0.24 percent to Rs 8.30 at 13:21 hrs.  Through FY21, the operating environment continued to remain challenging due to ‘unsustainable pricing’ and ‘hyper-competition,’ which were further aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic, Vodafone Idea chairman Himanshu Kapania said in a letter to shareholders.  “As the industry continues to remain under unsustainable financial duress, your company is hopeful that the government will provide the necessary support to address all structural issues faced by the sector,” he said in the letter.  Vodafone Idea is optimistic that the government will support its efforts to generate reasonable returns on their massive investments, he added.  Rating company ICRA also pointed out that government support is critical.  Vodafone Idea’s financial stress, underlined by mounting losses and rising debt. is likely to impact its financial lenders and have a bearing on employees and subscribers, ICRA said on September 6, highlighting that government support is &quot;critical&quot; at this point.  Support can be by way of deferment of spectrum dues, a cut in levies, reduction in interest rates and a combination of relief measures to aid the financial profile and structure of the industry, PTI reported.  &amp;nbsp;  “Vodafone Idea may witness big swings due to its high beta nature but the situation is still vulnerable for this counter as there is a good chance that this sector is heading towards duopoly, therefore investors are advised to remain with the top two players,” Meena said. “Vodafone Idea already rallied around 40 percent this week in anticipation of relief measures, so there is a risk of profit-booking post-announcement, while a sharp sell-off can be seen if there are no relief measures. Technically, the 200-DMA of Rs 9.5 will act as a critical hurdle.”  The average revenue per user has bottomed out and is likely to continue its upside momentum, indicating a bullish outlook for the telecom sector, where both Reliance Industries and Bharti Airtel are good bets for growth, he advised.  Reliance Industries and Bharti Airtel have witnessed multi-month breakouts and the bullish momentum is likely to continue, according to Meena.  Reliance Industries, which owns telecom operator Jio, fell 1.3 percent to Rs 2,410 at 13:32 hrs on the BSE. The stock had a strong run-up in the past one month, hitting a record high of Rs 2,479.85 on September 6 with a market cap of more than Rs 15 lakh crore.  Technical Takes  “Bharti Airtel has broken its all-time high recently. Technical indicators like the 55-day EMA (exponential moving average) line also confirm a buy in it. A channel breakout in the technical charts also confirms a buy and so we expect a higher level of about Rs 780,” said Ashis Biswas, head of technical research at CapitalVia Global Research.  He said the Reliance Industries stock has confirmed a channel breakout. “Making higher highs on two consecutive monthly charts. Indicators like the 55-day EMA line and 22-day EMA line also confirm a bullish sentiment. We can expect a target of Rs 2,750,” Biswas said.  Vodafone Idea has been trading in a range.

For Bharti's 31.7 per cent shareholder, Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel), the transaction is 'credit neutral', it said.  Bharti Airtel board had recently approved raising up to Rs 21,000 crore by way of rights issue, at a price of Rs 535 per share.  In a statement, Moody's Investors Service said that the proceeds from the transaction are expected to be used for debt repayment and capital spending, including network upgrades, 5G investments and growth initiatives such as more aggressive subscriber growth to wrest market share from India's struggling third-largest operator, Vodafone Idea.  &quot;The transaction is credit positive for Bharti. Fresh capital will keep leverage relatively stable amid growing investments in 5G, ongoing cash payments for spectrum and a settlement payment related to the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dispute with the government,&quot; it added.  The fund raising also provides Bharti with more financial capacity to leverage its network in the Indian mobile space, as competition eases and tail winds from higher data usage and increases in average revenue per user (ARPU) benefit EBITDA and margins, Moody's noted.  &quot;We view the transaction as credit neutral for Bharti's 31.7 per cent shareholder, Singapore Telecommunications Limited,&quot; it said and while observing that Singtel can subscribe to its portion of the rights without a significant increase in leverage.  Singtel's 31.7 per cent ownership includes a direct stake of 14 per cent and indirect ownership through Bharti Telecom Limited.  Citing the terms of rights issuance, Moody's wrote that Singtel would need to pay only about $100 million as upfront payment for subscribing to rights from its direct stake in Bharti, and the remaining $300 million is callable over the next 36 months, which can be accommodated within the ratings for Singtel.  In case Singtel has to make further debt-funded payments for BTL's portion of the rights, &quot;its leverage will weaken&quot;.  &quot;However, in our view, the likelihood of that is low,&quot; it said.  Bharti Airtel's rights issue is a move that is expected to strengthen its competitive positioning in the market, and provide the telco with the necessary ammunition for aggressive 5G rollout.  The promoter and promoter group of the company would collectively subscribe to the full extent of their aggregate rights entitlement.

A day after telecom major Bharti Airtel announced that its Board of Directors has approved to raise capital up to Rs 21,000 crore via a rights issue, Sunil Bharti Mittal, while addressing the media, said the company's debt is at an 'extraordinary' level and that he believes &quot;there is an opportunity to accelerate growth. We needed access to growth capital.&quot;  The chairman of the telco also estimated the ARPU (average revenue per user) to trend towards Rs 200 in this financial year and said it was time to raise tariffs. Airtel's ARPU rose Rs 146 from Rs 145 in the March quarter. The current ARPU, as stated in Q1 results, is Rs 146. He also clarified that there were no plans to sell more promoter stakes as that would be 'inappropriate'.  Bharti Airtel's fund raising is expected to strengthen its competitive positioning in the market and provide the telco with the necessary ammunition for aggressive 5G rollout, analysts said, according to a PTI report.  The capital raising announcement, though unexpected and surprising, would enable Airtel to enhance its market share and provides it wherewithal to make faster investment in a scenario India moves to a two-player market earlier than expected, some analysts felt.  Global research firm CLSA has maintained its buy rating on the stock with target at Rs 780 per share. &quot;Sunil Bharti Mittal sees a need for ARPU to reach Rs 200 in 2022 against our forecast of Rs 199 by FY24,&quot; the brokerage firm said, according to a CNBC-TV18 report.

Citi also has a buy call on the stock with target at Rs 760 per share. &quot;Commitment of promoters to the Rights Issue is positive and should inspire confidence. Staggered nature of capital raise indicates gradual deployment of funds,&quot; the research firm said.  &quot;Key to stock performance will hinge on strong FCF generation. FCF generation contingent on market share gains and tariff hikes,&quot; it added.  Domestic research firm ICICI Direct has a buy on the stock with target of Rs 720 per share with a time frame of 12 months. &quot;The company expects 5G spectrum auction in early FY23 and rollout from second half with rollout initially in large cities and expansion into smaller markets in later years. Furthermore, 5G device ecosystem has improved with increased proportion of 5G device shipment and reasonable prices,&quot; the brokerage firm said.  &quot;The promoters stake is likely to be stable as Bharti Telecom is debt free. This move of expanding growth war chest (to capture incremental market share and 5G foray) without stretching leverage is positive, in our view.

The increased cash would help Bharti to further increase its market share as it would be able to invest in its network/branding and distribution, BofA Securities report said, adding, Airtel should also be able to fortify its 5G spectrum in the upcoming auction.

AIRTEL,2021-08-24T16:49:01+05:30,Moneycontrol News,Videocon AGR dues: SC restrains Centre from encashing Airtel's bank guarantee for three weeks,"A Department of Telecommunications notice, issued to Bharti Airtel on August 17, warned that failure to make payment will result in invocation of its bank guarantees.","The Supreme  Court on August 24 restrained the Centre from encashing Bharti Airtel's bank guarantees for a period of at least three weeks to recover adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues of Videocon Telecom.  Videocon Telecom, whose spectrum was taken over by Airtel in 2016 for Rs 4,428 crore, is assessed to owe an amount of Rs 1,376 crore to the government in form of AGR dues.  On August 17, the DoT had issued a demand notice asking Airtel to pay the pending AGR dues of Videocon within a week. If the Sunil Mittal-led telecom giant fails to pay the stated amount within the stipulated time, its bank guarantees would be invoked, the department said.  Airtel subsequently moved the apex court, appealing the bench to restrain the DoT from encashing its bank guarantees.  Spectrum trading guidelines dictate that Videocon should have cleared all dues prior to concluding any agreement for spectrum trading, the company's counsel told the bench, as per a CNBC TV 18 report.  Videocon liability is now being foisted on Bharti Airtel by DoT, the counsel added, further pointing out that even if Videocon's liability is added to Airtel’s AGR, the latter's payment of Rs 18,004 crore &quot;easily satisfies the 10 percent payment that had to be made by March 2021&quot;.  The court, apart from restraining the Centre from invoking Airtel's bank guarantees for three weeks, allowed the company to approach the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) to challenge DoT's order on Videocon's AGR dues.  Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who opposed Airtel's bid to approach the TDSAT, told the court that the demand notice issued by DoT was as per the SC’s order on AGR dues issued in September 2020, Economic Times reported. Mehta further added that he would contest the jurisdiction of the TDSAT to decide on the issue, the report added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/telecom/videocon-agr-dues-sc-restrains-centre-from-encashing-airtels-bank-guarantee-for-three-weeks-7381481.html

The matter was being heard by a bench comprising Justices LN Rao and Hrishikesh Roy on July 23.  In 2020, the apex court  gave 10 years' time to telecom service providers struggling to pay Rs 93,520 crore of AGR-related dues to clear their outstanding amount to the government.  A bench headed by Justice LN Rao referred to the earlier order passed by the apex court in the matter and observed that they said no re-assessment of AGR-related dues could be done.  However, in their plea, the telecoms majors raised the issue of alleged errors in calculation in the figure of AGR-related dues demanded by the Department of Telecommunication (DoT).  To strengthen its appeal, Vodafone said it was about to go under owing to dues of Rs 1.8 lakh crore, and sought correction of arithmetic errors. Bharti Airtel, on the other hand, had claimed duplication, unaccounted payments, and disallowed deductions.  The three telecom companies — Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and Tata Teleservices — appealed to the Supreme Court to allow them to make staggered AGR payments.  According to the DoT, Bharti Airtel owes over Rs 43,000 crore as AGR dues, while Vodafone Idea has a balance payment of more than Rs 50,000 crore.  In 2020, the top court upheld the Government of India’s position on the calculation of statutory liabilities. The Centre suggested that revenue from non-core businesses should also be included in arriving at the annual AGR amount.  Burdened with the claim from the DoT, the telcos appealed to the Supreme Court to provide the option of staggered payments over either 20 years or 10 years. Vodafone-Idea argued that the only way to repay such a huge sum would be to ‘earn and pay’.  However, the Solicitor General informed the Supreme Court that DOT had not shared any instructions on allowing correction of errors, and the apex court too, had on three previous occasions, held that the AGR demand cannot be recomputed.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/agr-case-supreme-court-dismisses-telecom-firms-plea-seeking-recomputation-of-dues-7210141.html

The company said the new offering 'Airtel Black' is compliant with TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) norms.  &quot;Bharti Airtel...today announced the launch of its latest innovation Airtel Black – India's first all-in-one solution for homes... Airtel Black is the new programme for the discerning, quality-seeking customers,&quot; the company said in a statement.  The company is offering flexibility to create customised plans on Airtel Black. It has also lined up four new fixed plans with different combinations, where prices range from Rs 998 a month (for 2 mobile connections and 1 DTH connection) to Rs 2,099 a month (for 3 mobile connections, 1 Fibre connection, 1 DTH connection).  The plans have already gone live in the market.  Airtel Black does away with the hassle of managing multiple bill payment dates, navigating customer care IVRs, or interacting with separate service providers.  To a question on these rates stacking up higher than the bundled plans available earlier, Shashwat Sharma, Director – Marketing and Communications, Bharti Airtel, asserted it would be &quot;unfair&quot; to draw a one-to-one comparison.  &quot;One Airtel plan was our beta, in a way. This is a completely different programme, this is all about premium experience with customers, premium onboarding. Some of the bundles which were running earlier catered to limited set of customers,&quot; Sharma explained.  Customers are looking for more data today. So the plans have been tuned to needs of customers in the current context where more data is being offered with miniscule price that has been changed, all aligned to plans that customers want, Sharma noted.  On whether Airtel is looking at APRU hike through these plans, the company responded in affirmative.  &quot;This congregates the high value customers together. The biggest thing in telecom is customers are willing to pay for a great services and this brings that to fore. For us, it is a very strong foray for strengthening our ARPUs going forward,&quot; Sharma added.  Customer's home has become the single place for both work life and personal life, in today's world. The need for high speed data, the entertainment at home and the requirement for seamless connectivity on mobile, is now one holistic need, Airtel statement said.  Yet, these services have historically been bought and managed as individual services.  &quot;Customers have expressed their frustration on multiple bills to be paid on different due dates across the months, services getting switched off due to forgotten recharges, and difficulty in managing services from multiple local service providers. We decided to innovate to solve this customer problem,&quot; it added.  Under 'Airtel Black', customer will connect to a care representative within 60 seconds of calling, the company promised.  The team of experts managing the customer relationship keeps in touch for all of customers' requirements and solves them on a priority basis, it added.  &quot;As an integrated operator, Airtel is uniquely positioned to deliver an exceptional experience on all home services – fibre, DTH and mobile, to our customers.

Making his case, Mittal said that the telecom industry was “under tremendous stress” and hoped that the government and authorities would focus on keeping “India’s digital dream intact through the three operators”, the report added.  Analysts, however, are not hopeful for a tariff hike and pointed out competition from Reliance Jio’s new cheap 4G phone with Google, which will be in the market by September 10.
