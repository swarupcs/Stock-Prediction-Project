In addition, the conglomerate, which is into oil refining, telecommunications and retail, is also facing unfriendly tax proposals that could hit its businesses.Shares of the company have slid almost 8% since reaching a record high in mid-December. A spokesman for RIL declined to comment. Here are four challenges the company is facing:Aramco deal delay:Mukesh Ambani told shareholders in August that RIL would sell 20% of its oil and petrochemicals unit to Aramco in a deal valuing the business at $75 billion. The sale is crucial to reduce the group’s net debt, which was about $22 billion at the end of March 2019.But in December, the government requested a court to stop the proposed sale to help ensure the Mumbai-based company has enough assets to pay claims in an arbitration case related to profit sharing and royalty payments between Reliance Industries and its partners. RIL says the government’s plea isn’t tenable legally and should be dismissed.RIL expected to complete the Aramco transaction by March 2020 subject to due diligence and regulatory approvals, but said in January that although the talks with Aramco were making “good progress,” a definitive pact is still a few months away. The talks have gathered pace in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.Income tax (I-T) investigation:The tax department has widened a probe to find whether some Ambani family members have evaded tax, according to people familiar with the matter. The conglomerate has denied that they have dodged taxes.The investigation is based on information the government received from French authorities in 2011 about 700 Indians who had accounts at HSBC Holdings Plc’s Swiss branches, the people said, asking not to be named citing rules.While tax probes are common in India and are, in many cases, driven by politics, the country’s richest family becoming the subject of an investigation is unprecedented and has surprised many. Ambani is Asia’s richest person, with a net worth of about $58 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.A spokesperson for the tax department didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.Protective tariff scrapped:Reliance Industries, the country’s largest producer of a chemical used to make polyester yarn, will face more competition in the segment after a proposed cut in import duties for purified terephthalic acid. In her February 1 budget speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government is getting rid of the duty to help ensure the easy availability of the commodity at competitive prices.Tax on investment trusts:The government has also proposed a change to dividend distribution tax, a step that could slow efforts of companies, including Reliance Industries, to raise funds through selling units in investment trusts.The conglomerate has been trying to raise funds and pare debt by selling a stake in trusts that hold its telecom towers and optical-fiber network.The change in rules will curtail returns for investors in the trusts by forcing them to add dividends to their total income and paying tax. The impact of higher tax for unit holders may make equity raising challenging, according to Shubham Jain, a senior vice president at ICRA Ltd, the local unit of Moody’s Investors Service.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mukesh-ambanis-plans-to-make-reliance-industries-debt-free-hit-multiple-snags/articleshow/74278747.cms,,1

The country is in the middle of a major digital transformation and organisations like Jio have played a big part in getting hundreds of millions of Indian people and small businesses online.This is especially important right now, because small businesses are the core of every economy and they need our support.

And local retailers are at the heart of it as well. The local arm of the Seattle-based e-tailer said it has on-boarded 5,000 offline retailers across categories on its platform under what it calls 'Local Shops'. Started as a pilot six months back, local standalone stores selling grocery, consumer electronics ,apparel and other products are live on Amazon across metro and non-metro markets like Delhi, Mumbai,Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Coimbatore, Surat, Indore and Lucknow. This also includes relatively better known retailers like Sangeetha Electronics, Croma, Vishal Megamart among others.The local stores selling online would also fulfill most of the deliveries on their own as they would be enabled with Amazon's technology to serve local orders first based on pin-codes where they can deliver the same day or next day. If a retailer is willing to sell nationally, they will be able to sell through Amazon’s fulfillment services. Gopal Pillai, head of seller services, Amazon India, said the company would be committing about Rs 10 crore for the Local Shops programme to scale it up further. “This would leverage the best of local stores and Amazon’s network. Local stores are known for fast deliveries within short distances while Amazon’s wide reach would bring more traffic to these retailers, who have good stock availability. A retailer can choose to deliver certain pincodes on its own or by hiring a third-party, and rest can be done through Amazon---in a different part of the same city or other cities,” Pillai said. In light of ongoing lockdown due to the virus outbreak, this could plug the drop in footfall at stores partially, at least, he added. Over the last one month, kiranas and local shops have come to the rescue of Indian consumers as the lockdown crippled the supply chain of essentials across large-scale retail stores while online platforms struggled to fulfill rising demand of essentials. On Wednesday Ambani said nearly 3 crore kiranas in the near future will be able to transact digitally with their consumers in their neighbourhood through JioMart -- the new commerce platform which it has already launched in Mumbai's suburbs like Navi Mumbai and Thane. The orders are expected to be placed through WhatsApp. This is being seen as a potential game-changer for how online-to-offline (O2O) commerce could work. With Amazon’s serious play, going forward, this space would see an intense action. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, earlier in January, announced a $1 billion investment in India to digitise small and medium businesses by 2025. The company has already invested over $7 billion in this market. TOI reported on Thursday saying Reliance has already started roping in kiranas in its network by offering them merchandise, working capital loans, and digital payment solutions, including point-of-sale (PoS) machines.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-rils-kirana-play-amazon-moves-to-woo-neighbourhood-stores/articleshow/75323461.cms,,2

The online-to-offline (O2O) commerce initiative could potentially change the landscape of retail, given WhatsApp’s reach of over 400 million customers in India.Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani said nearly 3 crore kiranas in the near future will be able to transact digitally with their consumers in their neighbourhood through JioMart — the new commerce platform, which it has already launched in Mumbai’s suburbs like Navi Mumbai and Thane. The orders are expected to be placed through WhatsApp, while Reliance had already started roping in kiranas in its network by offering them merchandise, working capital loans, and digital payment solutions, including point-of-sales (PoS) machines.  75307566The idea is to make the best of the “high-quality front end” of WhatsApp and Jio’s feet-on-the-street execution. “With this partnership what WeChat has done in China becomes a possibility. Facebook is a technology company and is not into handling logistics or moving goods, very clearly what they wanted was a partner who can handle all of it,” said a person involved in the transaction.  The mini-apps inside messaging app WeChat, which has 1.15 billion users, did business of $115 billion in 2019 in China across online retail, food delivery, ride-hailing, paying bills and booking tickets. Besides tie-ups with kiranas, Reliance has 11,316 stores across consumer electronics, fashion & lifestyle, and grocery (as of December quarter). The development comes as consumers, amid the virus outbreak, are starting to warm up to the idea of ordering essentials from their local shops through individual WhatsApp chats, albeit at a small scale.“They have started work on WhatsApp collaboration. While Ajio (fashion and lifestyle) is fully operating on the O2O model, Reliance is in the process of taking it to the wider retail businesses in other segments. The O2O model, where supply is linked with the inventory at nearby retail stores and not large warehouses, works better with unstructured categories, like grocery and other essentials,” a person aware of Reliance’s O2O plans said.Grocery is a thin-margin business and the model should be scalable, which has led to multiple pilots in different cities across the country, this person added.  75308253The cautious approach is preceded by on-ground challenges that companies in India have faced while trying the O2O model in the country. It hasn’t got the kind of traction that it did in China. “The opportunity is immense but the execution at every small store is critical. The demand pattern is different across cities and stocking adequately in right locations is a challenge. This would impact the timing of delivery — which is important for day-to-day items,” said a senior e-commerce executive who has worked on this model.All said, the final interface of JioMart and WhatsApp would play a differentiator as consumers are used to the easy-to-use design of how WhatsApp messaging works. To bring chat-based commerce and customer services, it would be a challenge to keep the design framework simple.Reliance’s bullishness on the model is further seen in a spate of acquisitions — Fynd, an O2O startup that was backed by Google; Grab, a hyper-local logistics company, and chatbot platform Haptik, among others.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-plans-to-bring-kiranas-closer-to-you/articleshow/75306938.cms,,2

RIL’s debt has ballooned to $43 billion (Rs 3.06 lakh crore) following its aggressive entry into the telecom sector four years ago. It has invested more than Rs 3.50 lakh crore in building digital infrastructure which included splurging on acquisitions. In the recent past, concerns were raised about RIL’s mounting liabilities but the company debunked those by saying it has a clear roadmap for debt reduction. Read also: Level the field — News producers can’t keep incurring costs while digital platforms drain away profitsAt the annual shareholder meet last year, Ambani announced plans to make RIL a “zero net debt” company by March 31, 2021. But, legal roadblocks, among other factors, have hindered his asset monetisation deals. Last August, RIL had said that it will complete the $15 billion investment by Saudi Aramco by March but a closure to the deal seems to be away.  75314658Analysts believe that RIL is on track to reduce its net debt this fiscal after Jio Platforms’ deal with Facebook and its fuel retail joint venture (JV) with BP got the European Union regulator’s approval on Monday. RIL will receive Rs 7,000 crore from BP in lieu of the 49% stake in the JV and the deal is expected to be closed this quarter.  75307566“The two transactions will accelerate RIL’s deleveraging story and give the company more time to work in closing other deals involving Aramco and Brookfield (in telecom towers),” said Narendra Solanki, head-equity research, Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers. RIL is also looking to unlock value in its entertainment channel business and has held talks with Sony Corporation for the same. RIL has a net debt of Rs 1.53 lakh crore ($20 billion) and according to foreign brokerage firm CLSA, the company’s net debt will come down by 20% in this quarter. “Leverage is getting more manageable and concerns around this should diminish,” wrote CLSA in its report post the Facebook-Jio Platforms announcement. Of the total $5.7 billion investment by Facebook, Jio Platforms will retain $2.14 billion (Rs 15,000 crore), while the remaining $4.08 billion (Rs 28,574 crore) will be used to retire debt it owes to RIL. “The Facebook deal will be a major cash boost for RIL since the current uncertainties in the crude oil market may cast a shadow on its deal with Aramco,” said Rajeev Shah, MD, RBSA Advisors.

It is valued higher than India’s second and third largest technology companies - Infosys and Wipro - combined. Jio Platforms will also be 70% more valuable than its closest rival Bharti Airtel, which had a closing market capitalisation of Rs 2.73 lakh crore on Wednesday.In October 2019, RIL consolidated the digital platform business under a separate subsidiary to mirror the structure of global companies like Alphabet-Google, Tencent and Alibaba which are largely debt-free, making it easier to attract investors into the new entity.75312727The RIL-FB transaction has been in the works since last year, with the first few meetings between the top teams including Ambani and Zuckerbeg revolving around understanding the potential areas of business collaboration. The conversations progressed with the initial target of closing the deal on March 31. But the outbreak of Covid-19 delayed the final lap of due-diligence.Facebook will get a board seat and an “observer seat” on Jio Platforms. The deal is a binding agreement, according to RIL, but will need approval from antitrust watchdog Competition Commission of India. The announcement boosted RIL’s shares to close at Rs 1,363.6, up by 10.2% on the NSE. The deal will also see a tie-up between RIL’s retail unit and Facebook’s WhatsApp to leverage each other's platforms to allow consumers to order items from their local kirana stores. This would enable Facebook to monetise its large user base, while also potentially serve as a platform to drive adoption of its payment business under WhatsApp which will compete with Google Pay, Alibaba and Softbank-backed Paytm and Walmart-owned Phonepe.“India has more than 60 million small businesses and millions of people rely on them for jobs. With communities around the world in lockdown, many of these entrepreneurs need digital tools they can rely on to find and communicate with customers and grow their businesses,” Zuckerberg said.Ambani, said industry observers, wants Jio to be known as a digital services platform like US-based Google and China’s Alibaba, and not just as a telecom player.

All of us have remote access and most records are today stored digitally. And therefore, while it is obviously not the same as working in the office, I guess we in the finance world are lucky that we can work from home and can operate with a great deal of efficiency,"" Balakrishnan told PTI in an interview over telephone.Bank of America Merrill Lynch has managed a number of equity and debt market deals in India in the recent past, including SBI Card IPO, HDFC Life block deal, Avenue Supermarts share placements and a US debt placement worth $310 million for Adani Transmission.Globally, it has helped Petronas and Carnival Cruises raise funds, among other big deals.Giving a perspective about the lockdown and its impact on investment banking business globally and in India, Balakrishnan said most of the world is under lockdown right now and China is the only place where people have started coming back to office, but they went into lockdown in January itself and they are getting back after more than three months.""We (in India) have been under lockdown for only one month,"" he said.The veteran investment banker said while markets corrected significantly, most companies across the world went out and drew down their credit lines and improved their liquidity positions.Secondly, as soon as markets started falling, bond markets almost shut down for a while after a very strong bond market activity through January and February, he said.""But, the bond market rallied quickly around the middle of March. Through the second half of March and April, we had a very strong period for global investment grade bonds. Highly rated companies with investment grade ratings, went out and tapped the bond market and raised liquidity. So, after drawing on revolving credit lines, bond market fund raising happened,"" he said.Similarly, deal activity began in the US and spread to Europe and then to other places. Last week, Bank of America helped Petronas -- despite the stress in oil prices -- successfully raise $6 billion from the bond market. This indicates that for a quality issuer, even for a hard hit sector, a large bond offering even now, Balakrishnan said.He further said the leveraged finance market has also begun seeing a revival, while companies have started raising equity and doing other equity-linked transactions.""One major transaction Bank of America did in this space recently is for a US-based cruise company, Carnival Cruises,"" he said.""In India, we have had an excellent run in the last four months. In March, we successfully reopened the Indian equity capital markets by pricing a $300 million block trade in HDFC Life for Standard Life Aberdeen on a sole basis.""Also, we helped SBI Cards raise $1.4 billion via an IPO, which was the largest in the last ten years. In February also, we had helped D-Mart raise over $1 billion through a QIP and an OFS route,"" he said.Balakrishnan said many companies are right now waiting to declare their results and after that they will look to raise funds through equity or bonds and shore up their capital structure. At the same time, M&A dialogues continue as companies evaluate assets and deals which are of strategic importance.""Deals which made strategic sense before COVID-19 will do so even after COVID-19 too,"" he added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/all-locked-down-but-dealmakers-ensure-show-must-go-on-billion-dollar-deals-aplenty-for-right-biz/articleshow/75413360.cms,,2

In contrast, Reliance Trends, which is into more affordable products, can use the Facebook platform to reach out to more consumers.”Questionnaires emailed to Reliance Retail and Facebook did not elicit responses till the time of going to the press.Commenting on the deal, for which Facebook is paying around $5.7 billion for buying 10% in the digital arm of Reliance, a Credit Suisse report on Monday said the partnership could later be extended into other retail categories such as medicine distribution, fashion & lifestyle stores and food delivery, as the Jio investment signals social media giant’s intention of capturing India’s vast ecommerce potential.The investment provides Facebook with a chance to onboard the large small and medium businesses and drive ecommerce via the JioMart venture, the report showed.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/jio-facebook-alliance-may-go-beyond-kirana-stores/articleshow/75419265.cms,,0

The company has not disclosed the amount of money it plans to raise through the rights offer, or any other details about it.Through a stock exchange notice on Monday, RIL said its board will meet on April 30 to “consider a proposal to issue equity shares to existing shareholders on rights basis”. Early this month, RIL had said that the board had approved a proposal to raise Rs 25,000 crore through non-convertible debentures (NCDs).RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani will lead a board meeting on Thursday to consider the proposal of issuing new shares to existing shareholders, currently numbering over 23 lakh, according to data from the BSE. Ambani and his family owns 50% in RIL, which currently has a market capitalisation of nearly Rs 9.1 lakh crore.  75416764During rights offers, the promoters can avoid diluting their stake in the company by subscribing to their share of quota in the offer. In case other shareholders do not subscribe to their individual quota, even those shares could be bought by existing shareholders, including the promoters.The RIL’s rights issue proposal comes days after it inked India’s largest FDI deal, in the technology sector, with social media giant Facebook to raise Rs 43,574 crore by selling 9.9% in Jio, its digital platform business. Analysts see the rights issue proposal as RIL’s move to reduce its debt of $43 billion further. RIL had also planned to use the proceeds from the sale of its stake in Jio Platforms to deleverage its balance sheet.The last time RIL tapped the public for funds was in 1991 when it had issued convertible debentures. The debentures were subsequently converted into equity shares at Rs 55 apiece.Apart from the rights issue proposal, the board of RIL will also consider the financial statements of the $90-billion explorations-to-telecom company. Fiscal 2020’s fourth quarter results of RIL’s core business could be impacted as demand for transportation fuels have slumped due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Retail (specifically grocery) and telecom could see limited impact because of the increased consumption during the lockdown.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-to-finalise-first-rights-offer-in-29-years-on-apr-30/articleshow/75416765.cms,,2

In its quarterly earnings commentary on April 30, RIL said that it has received interest from multiple global investors to buy additional stakes in Jio Platforms and that it would announce investments similar to the Facebook transaction. In that context, though the Silver Lake investment is positive, the size is very small compared to the Facebook deal and hence investors would like to see more marquee transactions in Jio Platforms, wrote analysts at JP Morgan in their research report. While RIL has not specified the total quantum of stake it intends to sell in Jio Platforms to outside parties, the share sales form part of chairman Mukesh Ambani’s broader plan to take the unit public in the future. Last October, RIL placed the entire digital and telecom assets in its 100% arm Jio Platforms in order to bring in external investors. Foreign investors now have a holding of 11.14% in Jio Platforms, a startup launched in late 2016 and that has become a force to reckon within the telecommunications industry with 388 million subscribers. The digital services business earned an operating profit of Rs 14,363 crore on an annual revenue of Rs 68,462 crore—up 64% and 41% from fiscal 2019. RIL has launched an aggressive programme to augment its balance sheet, which includes stake sales in its subsidiaries, rights offering and slowing down on fresh investments. The nation’s most valued enterprise, which is shifting its positioning from an energy-driven player to a consumer/technology-focused company, has a debt of Rs 3.36 lakh crore as on March 31, 2020. Ambani had said that he plans to make RIL a net debt-free company by the end of this financial year. Founded in 1999, Silver Lake, which manages assets worth $40 billion, places its bet mainly on technology and tech-enabled opportunities. The fund has investments in Dell Technologies, Twitter, Airbnb and Alibaba, to name a few. Its portfolio of investments collectively generates an annual revenue of over $230 billion and employs 3.7 lakh people worldwide. “Silver Lake has an outstanding record of being a valuable partner for leading technology companies globally. We are excited to leverage insights from their global technology relationships for the Indian digital society’s transformation,” said RIL chairman Ambani. Jio Platforms is Silver Lake’s third deal in the past one month after online travel booking firm Expedia and home-renting company Airbnb. “Jio Platform’s incredibly strong and entrepreneurial management team have brought extraordinary engineering capabilities to bear on bringing the power of low-cost digital services to a mass consumer and small businesses population. The market potential they are addressing is enormous, and we are honoured and pleased to have been invited to partner with Mukesh Ambani and the team at Reliance and Jio,” said Silver Lake Co-CEO Egon Durban.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-fb-us-firm-to-pay-750m-for-1-2-stake-in-jio/articleshow/75544478.cms,,0

The deal may see Reliance, through one of its subsidiaries, pay $130-150 million for the asset, which may also include a fresh infusion to expand the operations, said one of the sources mentioned earlier. “The deal is happening at a slight premium to their last funding round valuation,” said the source. Netmeds, which started operations in 2015, has till date announced three rounds of funding totalling about $100 million. The company was started by Pradeep Dadha, whose family was one of the first distributors for Sun Pharmaceuticals. The distribution business was later acquired by Sun Pharma. Besides Dadha’s family office, the Netmeds backers include healthcare investor OrbiMed, investment bank MAPE Advisory, Sistema Asia Fund and Singapore-based Daun Penh Cambodia Group. “As a policy, we do not comment on media speculation and rumours. Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis,” said a Reliance spokesperson, adding that it will inform exchanges according to Sebi on any developments.  75564361“It would not be productive to comment on media speculations at this stage,” said Dadha in an emailed response, while adding that Netmeds has tied up with Reliance Retail for supplying essentials like groceries to its customers.The conversations between Reliance and Netmeds, which had also held talks with Walmart-owned Flipkart, had been going on before the coronavirus lockdown, sources said. This will be the second major move by Reliance in the pharma sector as last year it acquired 82% in Bengaluru-based C-Square Info Solutions, which makes software for distributors, retailers and sales force in the pharma sector, for a total of Rs 82 crore. Some of the clients of the company include Apollo Pharmacy, Adcock Ingram and other players. The development comes as Reliance is ramping up it’s online-to-offline (O2O) commerce business, first with grocery with the tie-up between Reliance Retail and WhatsApp last month. That deal came after WhatsApp’s parent company Facebook agreed to invest $5.7 billion for a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms, the telecom and digital services business of Reliance. Netmeds generates 90% of its revenue from prescription medicine and over-the-counter drugs. This is similar to other medicine delivery platforms like 1MG, Medlife and Pharmeasy who drive 80-90% of their revenue from selling medicine, focused on chronic customers who make repeat purchases regularly. Last year, Netmeds announced it would add a dozen new warehouses to take the total to 26 as it expanded across India. A RedSeer report in February said it has a base of 6 lakh monthly transacting users. According to the RedSeer report, a market research firm, the e-pharma industry, including consultancy and diagnostics, is about $1.2 billion. This is expected to reach about $16 billion in five years. While over 4 million households were already opting for buying medicine online, this space has become one of the few beneficiaries of the virus outbreak as more consumers are opting to buy medicine online. By the middle of March, e-pharmacy platforms saw a strong spike in sales of masks and sanitisers. 1MG co-founder and CEO Prashant Tandon had said sales of these products were up by 10-20 times before the virus outbreak. “Order volumes are still higher than before Covid-19. But going forward, we are looking at supply issues and manpower crunch to meet the rising demand,” said CEO of another e-pharma platform. Typically, consumers on average transact 1.5-2 times from these companies, while average ticket size of purchase is Rs 1,400-1,700.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-plans-to-buy-e-pharmacy-netmeds/articleshow/75564362.cms,,2

India, which has imposed the world's biggest shutdown to battle the spread of the coronavirus, last month launched the Aarogya Setu (Health Bridge) app -- a Bluetooth and GPS-based application which alerts users who may have come in contact with people who later test positive for COVID-19. The app, which has been downloaded more than 83 million times so far, was initially available to India's roughly 500 million smartphone users on Google's Android and Apple devices, but not to around 400 million users of more basic feature phones. Within a week, a version of the app will be rolled out to more than 100 million users of the $9 JioPhone - a cheap, internet-enabled feature phone that runs on a mobile operating system named KaiOS, a senior government official told Reuters. Launched by Reliance Industries' telecoms unit in 2017, the phone gives users access to 4G mobile data and apps including Facebook Inc's popular WhatsApp messenger.  ""We are pushing it ... the testing is going on,"" said the official who declined to be identified as the plan is not public. India's technology ministry and Reliance Jio did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.  Contact tracing apps such as Aarogya Setu are being used in an attempt to speed up the process of identifying, testing and isolating people exposed to the virus before they spread it to others. While many countries around the world are using similar apps, some such as Australia and Colombia are turning to technology from Apple and Alphabet's Google amid citizens' privacy concerns and glitchy state-backed systems.

The sensex lost 886 points, or 2.8%, before closing at 31,123 points. Selling was led by foreign funds and across the broad, with Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, HDFC and Infosys accounting for most of the loss.The day’s fall more than wiped out the 637 points the sensex had gained on Wednesday on hopes of a stimulus package. Since the immediate spends of the fiscal stimulus package that was announced on Wednesday were relatively small, there were doubts if economic growth will revive soon. This was a concern for the market, HDFC Securities MD & CEO Dhiraj Relli said. 75749535On the other hand, in the US on Wednesday, its central bank’s chief Jerome Powell had said that the Covid-19 pandemic may leave a lasting impact on the global economy. This also spooked investors and US stocks closed lower, which in turn had an impact on Asian markets.As foreign funds led the selling, Thursday’s session here recorded a net outflow of Rs 2,153 crore, while domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 802 crore, according to BSE data. The day’s strong selling also left investors poorer by a little over Rs 2 lakh crore, with the BSE’s m-capitalisation now at Rs 122.6 lakh crore.According to Religare Broking VP (research) Ajit Mishra, the rise on Thursday in the number of Covid-19 infections in India and lack of clarity over the impact of the stimulus package weighed on sentiment. Going forward, “the focus would remain on the FM’s announcements over the next few days”, which will detail the probable beneficiaries of the stimulus package.“Markets will react to those announcements in the following sessions.” In addition, the guidelines for the next phase of lockdown will also be on the mind of market players, Mishra said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-dives-886-points-as-stimulus-disappoints/articleshow/75749538.cms,,1

The four foreign firms together own 14.8% of Jio with RIL holding the balance 85.2%.RIL launched Jio in 2016 by offering free voice calls and ultra cheap 4G data plans. Since then, it has transformed India’s telecom sector, emerging as the largest player with 388 million subscribers.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/general-atlantic-picks-1-3-in-jio-for-rs-6598-crore/articleshow/75796185.cms,,0

This means one can run any task — grocery delivery, medicine delivery, pickup-and-drop — by using the Dunzo tab inside the payments app.Dunzo, where Google is also an investor, is believed to be clocking over 1 lakh orders a day amid high demand for essential needs. For Dunzo, this would mean getting access to a large set of new users. For Google Pay, which is seeing higher usage in areas like utility payments but fewer payment volumes overall amid the lockdown, more consumers would frequent its app to use services like Dunzo and pay digitally. In 2019, Google Pay had announced it has 67 million monthly active users (MAU) in India. Last month, TOI reported, quoting SimilarWeb data, that it had 115 million MAU in March, growing by 45% from February. As the number of Covid-19 positive cases are still rising in India, more consumers are going for online delivery of essentials.Last week, Reliance Industries’ JioMart, which is running a pilot with Facebook-owned messaging application WhatsApp, announced that it has opened services in 200 cities. Other platforms like Swiggy, Zomato, Amazon India and Bigbasket are also scaling up their grocery play, with many of them offering deliveries in 2-4 hours from kirana stores. “Consumables (grocery and other essentials) is now 75% of the total volumes for Dunzo, which was around 45% when the first lockdown was imposed in March. Fundamentally, it (shopping) has become need-based and there is no impulse that you can create as there is enough demand already. What this also does is you don’t have to discount,” Dunzo co-founder and CEO Kabeer Biswas told TOI last week. Biswas added that this had led to customer acquisition costs coming down to zero for the Bengaluru-based startup. While Dunzo is trying to service higher volumes, it also took a decision of pausing deliveries in select geographies in the outskirts of cities to serve higher demand coming from within the city. This would be 5-6% of its total geographical reach. It is present in eight cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai.A Google Pay spokesperson confirmed the Dunzo storefront on its platform. “The launch of the Dunzo Spot and the addition of LPG service providers are all examples of how we’re solving this (customer and business needs),” it added. Google Pay recently expanded the footprint of the Nearby Stores Spot to 35 cities, where users can find if nearby stores, selling essentials, are open and make digital payments if the store offers delivery. Google Pay rival PhonePe also has a similar offering on its platform named Stores. A Dunzo spokesperson did not respond to TOI’s emailed query till the time of going to the press. Some other storefronts, or ‘Spots’, on Google Pay include MakeMyTrip and Urban Company (formerly UrbanClap).",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gpay-ties-up-with-dunzo-for-essentials/articleshow/76079163.cms,,2

He said these figures provide confidence that the country is poised for a turnaround.Goyal said the contraction rate is coming down despite the fact that the country was under lockdown during large part of May.Further talking about June exports, he said the situation gets even more exciting as ""our export in the first week of June, is at par with what it was in June 1-7, 2019"".Exports during June 1-7 this year dipped by only about 0.76 per cent to $4.94 billion from $5.03 billion in the same period last year, the minister said.He added that some stress could be there on certain discretionary spending sectors, and segments like textiles may take a little longer to recover.""I hope that by the time we close March 2021, we would have recovered the lost ground of April and May. It will be a loss of close to USD 30 billion in two months....I have the confidence that our exporters and logistics companies together will make that happen,"" he said.Contracting for the second straight month, India's exports shrunk by a record 60.28 per cent in April to $10.36 billion, mainly on account of the coronavirus lockdown.Imports also plunged by 58.65 per cent to $17.12 billion in April, leaving a trade deficit of $6.76 billion as against $15.33 billion in April 2019.The webinar was organised by digital freight forwarding startup Freightwalla.Talking about migrant workers, Goyal said now the industry needs to take proper care of them when they return for work.""...you cannot leave them in the lurch, you cannot let them fend for themselves. I think there will be lot of good coming up out of this lockdown that we faced. The good will be in terms of better future and security for the migrant labour,"" he said.He added that now there will be more concern about their better housing, nutrition and welfare measures.""I do hope all stakeholders going forward will really look at these migrants as important stakeholders of our businesses...

But in the halls of Reliance Industries Ltd, Manoj Modi has quietly become one of the most powerful forces behind the corporate empire of Asia’s richest man.Reserved and mostly invisible to the public, Modi is viewed by many insiders and others in India’s business world as the right hand of billionaire Mukesh Ambani. He played a key role during negotiations for a $5.7 billion deal with Facebook Inc in April, backing Ambani and his children as they hashed out an agreement with the social networking giant, people familiar with the matter said.As Ambani, 63, shifts his sprawling conglomerate’s focus from petrochemicals to internet technologies, Modi is seen as a particularly influential voice. Facebook’s investment in the group’s Jio Platforms was followed by similar deals from a slew of private-equity funds, injecting $13 billion into the business and placing it firmly on Silicon Valley’s radar.The sixty-something, diminutive Modi -- who isn’t related to India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- rarely gives interviews and there’s little in the public realm about his private life. Yet he illustrates how lesser known personalities in India with long-running ties to corporate dynasties can have an outsized impact.“It’s not a company that advertises its organizational structure but the industry knows that Ambani and Modi are a strongly-bonded team -- and together drive deal negotiation and relentless execution to the last level of detail,” said Vani Kola, managing director of venture capital firm, Kalaari Capital Partners, who persuaded Modi to make a rare public appearance at a conference last year, albeit by video.A Reliance spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comments from the company and Modi.Making moneyModi is a director at Reliance Retail Ltd and the group’s telecom carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. At Kola’s conference, he downplayed his skills. “I don’t really negotiate,” Modi said. “I don’t understand strategy,” he went on. “In fact, people internally know that I don’t even have a vision.” He described his role, saying, “I deal with our internal people, coaching them, mentoring them and guiding them on how something can be done.”But then came a hint of his thinking: “Our principle at Reliance is very simple: Unless everyone makes money while working with us, you cannot have a sustainable business.”In interviews, more than half-a-dozen executives in the technology industry, who have had dealings with Reliance, said Modi has a reputation for driving hard bargains. When dealing with startups, he often controls negotiations from behind the scenes by instructing executives how far to push, making an appearance nearing deal fruition, they said.While Reliance’s recent mega investments have drawn the spotlight, the conglomerate also began an acquisition spree to buy smaller firms some years ago to build expertise in newer technologies from artificial intelligence to blockchain. The idea is to create a digital business that wields power in everything from online retail to streamed entertainment and internet payments.Modi has a big say in every deal and often a meeting with him signals the final stamp of approval, four different startup founders said in interviews.“He derives his power in the organization not just because of his loyalty, but because of his very astute, smart and able negotiator skills for Reliance Industries,” GR Gopinath, founder of budget carrier Air Deccan, who had sold a stake in his cargo airline to Reliance in 2010. “Significantly, though without formal education from Ivy League universities, he has a very sharp mind and a rare insight and native genius to grasp modern technology in the Indian context.”Gopinath said Modi is “ruthlessly efficient” and manages to get the best possible deal for Reliance in mergers and acquisitions.Modi is one of the few who have been with the company since the 1980s when Ambani’s late father was building the oil-and-petrochemicals giant. A few years earlier, Manoj Harjivandas Modi and Ambani had studied at what was then called the University Department of Chemical Technology in Mumbai and become fast friends.That’s allowed Modi a chance to work with three generations of the Ambani dynasty: The late patriarch Dhirubhai, then Mukesh and his wife Nita, and now his children Isha and Akash, who are playing more prominent roles on deals like Facebook.Over the years Modi became known as the execution man, overseeing large projects. He broke new ground by managing Reliance’s retail reach to smaller cities and expanded it to India’s largest retailer. But it was with the pathbreaking telecom service that Ambani built up that Modi came into his own.Telecom talksHis negotiating skills were very visible when Reliance Jio raced to launch its wireless services in 2016 and built its fiber optic cable network.One of the people who participated in the negotiations described a scene where select vendors were summoned to the headquarters for talks. The bait dangled in front of each was the massive scale of the project. Unknown to vendors at that time, multiple Reliance teams negotiated simultaneously in separate rooms with Modi as the interface guiding executives, that person said.These days, after crushing its rivals, Jio is the largest telecom operator in India with nearly 400 million users. It’s also increasingly important to global businesses like Facebook and WhatsApp as it serves as an entryway into an exploding digital economy and an e-commerce ecosystem that includes payments, education and health care.“Their work in expanding access to affordable mobile broadband has been phenomenal,” Ajit Mohan, vice president and managing director in India for Facebook, said of Ambani’s company.Among the skills Modi has honed is working with senior executives at Reliance, like Anshuman Thakur, head of strategy at Reliance Jio Infocomm and a long time banker, who plays a key role on deals and regularly briefs the press.Consumer spendingDuring the negotiations for the Facebook deal, Ambani, his children Isha and Akash, and Modi were key right through the discussions, one of the people familiar with the transaction said. Once Ambani gave the go ahead, Thakur worked to structure the deal, one of the people said.In recent weeks, Jio’s investor list has included big private equity names like KKR & Co, Silver Lake Partners, Vista Equity Partners and General Atlantic. Still, the global coronavirus pandemic is poised to put India on track for a sharp economic contraction, which means Modi and Ambani will have their work cut out for them growing digital sales while consumer spending slows.Meanwhile, a crash in oil prices caused uncertainty in negotiations to sell an estimated $15 billion stake in Reliance Industries’ oil and chemicals division to Saudi Arabian Oil Co, or Aramco, as part of its bid to pay down its formidable debt pile, which stood at more than $20 billion as of March last year. Reliance recently said the Aramco talks are progressing.Very little is known about the actual plans of Jio Platforms as the digital business rolls into the next phase of its expansion. Both Modi and his boss may have a joint hand in maintaining this level of secrecy.“Why talk needlessly when you can show your capabilities in the ranbhoomi,” said Kola, the venture capitalist, using the Hindi word for battlefield.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/the-rainmaker-behind-mukesh-ambanis-13-billion-deal-spree/articleshow/76334974.cms,,2
