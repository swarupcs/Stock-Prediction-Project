ITC,2024-07-24T11:46:08+05:30,2024-07-24,Zoya Springwala,"Titan, ITC seen benefitting most from consumption thrust in Budget 2024","As the dust from the Budget settles, a clearer picture emerges: the two winners on D-Street are expected to be ITC and Titan.","The Budget had more negative surprises than positive ones for the stock market, but investors in specific stocks have something to cheer about. According to analysts tracking consumer stocks, ITC and Titan are expected to benefit from some of the measures announced in the Budget.  Why Titan?  In the budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed to cut the customs duty on gold and silver from ten percent to six percent. Adding 5 percent AIDC or Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess, which remains unchanged, the total import duty on gold and silver has reduced from 15 percent to 11 percent.  &amp;nbsp;  Also Read | Post-budget, high-quality stocks expected to yield steady returns  &amp;nbsp;  The reduction in gold customs should improve Titan’s growth outlook, noted Macquarie. The brokerage raised its FY26/27E EPS by one/two percent on the Rakesh Jhunjhunwala stock to factor in the customs duty cut.  Domestic brokerage Emkay Global concurred, saying that the duty cut-led moderation in gold prices will catalyze customers who have been on the fence as a result of the spike in gold prices.  While Titan might see a moderate Q1 due to a spike in gold price, lesser wedding days, and election-related operating challenges, the second half of this financial year is expected to be better because of the duty cut and better operating environment.  A likely accelerated shift of consumers towards the organized sector, moving away from the local players makes a strong case for valuation re-rating, Emkay added.  Why ITC?  An age-old adage says no news is good news. No changes, updates or hikes in excise duty or NCCD (National Calamity Contingent Duty) are good news for the tobacco sector, especially India’s largest player: ITC.  Morgan Stanley said the Budget allayed one of the key concerns of tobacco tax hikes. ITC is extremely well-placed for sustainable growth, with strong business fundamentals. According to the brokerage, ITC is likely a re-rating play.  Jefferies India upgraded ITC to a buy rating, raising the target price to Rs 585 per share, foreseeing a 25 percent upside. The last tobacco tax hike was 2 percent in February 2023. This stability allows ITC to focus on volume with minimal price hikes, Jefferies said.  The brokerage further noted that GST taxes are expected to remain stable until March 2026 as the Centre settles state dues. Improving demand in the staple sector should benefit ITC's key businesses. The February 2025 Budget will be significant, but a modest price hike this year will lay the groundwork for next year.  About 90 percent of cigarette taxes fall under the GST regime (GST rate at 28 percent + compensation cess), earmarked until March 2026, to repay state borrowings, ensuring tax stability for the next 12-18 months.  Additionally, the outlook for the consumer staples sector is improving, which shall be a net positive for ITC as well.

","Jefferies India upgraded ITC Ltd to a buy rating, raising the target price to Rs 585 per share, up 25 percent from the current market price, after tobacco taxes remained unchanged in the 2024 Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23. Earnings per share were also increased by 1-2 percent.  Jefferies noted that the Union Budget kept tobacco taxes unchanged, which came as a relief for ITC. The last tobacco tax hike was 2 percent in February 2023. This stability allows ITC to focus on volume with minimal price hikes, Jefferies said.  Jefferies further noted that GST taxes are expected to remain stable until March 2026 as the Centre settles state dues. Improving demand in the staple sector should benefit ITC's key businesses. The February 2025 Budget will be significant, but a modest price hike this year will lay the groundwork for next year.  About 90 percent of cigarette taxes fall under the GST regime (GST rate at 28 percent + compensation cess), earmarked until March 2026, to repay state borrowings, ensuring tax stability for the next 12-18 months.  Jefferies said ITC's cigarette EBIT growth slowed to 4 percent in the second half of FY24 (versus 10 percent in the first half and 21 percent in FY23) due to volume normalisation and input cost inflation.  With clarity on cigarette taxation, ITC is set to boost revenue through volume, price hikes, and better mix. Input cost inflation will ease by the second half of FY25, supporting margin expansion. Jefferies expects cigarette EBIT growth to accelerate from 4 percent YoY in the second half od FY24 to 7 percent in the first half of FY25 and double digits by FY25 end.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/jefferies-upgrades-itc-to-buy-from-hold-hikes-target-price-to-rs-585-share-12776169.html,0,0.0

Additionally, the counter witnessed an ‘ascending triangle’ breakout, construing a positive development. From a technical standpoint, the counter has gained significant traction in terms of volumes lately, which is likely to augur well from a short to medium-term outlook. On the oscillator front, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) signals a continuation move, suggesting a potential upside journey in a comparable period. Hence, we recommend buying DMart around Rs 5,000-4,960.

Notably, the recent correction has occurred with very low volume, suggesting that bearish pressure is weakening near the Rs 860 support level. This level, previously a resistance, has now turned into support. Considering these factors, investors might consider buying Aether shares within the Rs 860-880 range, anticipating a potential price increase to a target of Rs 970. To manage risk effectively, it is advisable to set a stop-loss order around Rs 820 based on daily closing prices, protecting against potential downside movements.

However, following this spike, prices entered a consolidation phase attributed to overbought conditions. After consolidating for a month, prices resumed their upward trajectory, breaking above the upper range of consolidation, which also aligned with the October 2023 high. Volume analysis reveals significant activity during upward movements, contrasting with lower volumes during declines, suggesting accumulation in this stock.

However, with the advent of technology, the farming community now has the tools to tackle challenges and uncertainties in a more confident manner. Enhancing the competitiveness of domestic agri-value chains, strengthening market linkages and building traceable &amp;amp; climate smart value chains, ITC has successfully scaled up ITCMAARS – a crop-agnostic full stack AgriTech digital platform, together with a physical ecosystem, across 10 states. The ITCMAARS ‘Phygital’ platform now spans more than 1,650 Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) encompassing more than 15 lakh connected farmers and several industry partners including agri input manufacturers, banks, financial institutions and agri-tech startups.  By synergistically integrating NextGen agri technologies, ITCMAARS is developing a robust ecosystem to seamlessly deliver hyperlocal and personalised solutions to the Indian farming community leveraging world-class digital tools (including IoT) to develop new and scalable revenue streams, strengthen sourcing efficiencies and power ITC’s world-class Indian brands.  The ITCMAARS platform provides hyperlocal e-market services for agri inputs and farm outputs, enables access to credit and provides a wide range of predictive and prescriptive advisory services covering weather forecasts, agronomy, best practices for improved productivity, quality assurance, etc.  The integration of these package of practices enables the agri ecosystem to make a transformational shift towards superior value creation for all stakeholders. The ecosystem also provides access to sustainable Agri-inputs such as biologicals and nano-nutrients to farmers. New age functionalities such as ‘KrishiMitra’ – the world’s first Gen AI-based voice chatbot for farmers, enables innovative user-interface in vernacular languages deploying voice to text technology, thereby easing the adoption of digital technology by farming communities.  ITC has extended the ITCMAARS ecosystem to promote FPOs engaged in millets farming and has also partnered with the Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR), Hyderabad to promote high yielding varieties and advanced package of practices among millet farmers.  Recognising that the agriculture sector faces colossal challenges of ensuring food security, addressing climate change and enhancing productivity &amp;amp; farm incomes, ITC has pioneered several interventions to strengthen the competitiveness and build resilience of agri value chains.  A comprehensive Climate Smart Agriculture programme has been launched across 19 states to enable a transformation journey from Low Yield Low Resilient areas to High Yield and High Resilient villages through a package of agronomy practices, climate resilient varieties, precision farming, water management and appropriate mechanisation. Till date, 27.94 lakh acres and over 10.5 lakh farmers including 1.95 lakh women farmers have been covered under ITC’s Climate Smart Agriculture programme.  In addition to promotion of Climate Smart Agri practices at scale, in core agricultural catchments, ITC also has a Climate Smart Village (CSV) programme, wherein support is provided to majority of village population to enable adaptation to climate risks, mitigating the same through knowledge, livelihood diversification, natural resources management and institutional support. Over 6,700 CSVs covering major crop value chains are currently part of the programme. To provide additional support to farmers in dealing with climate risks, 15.24 lakh linkages were facilitated for farmers with six major government schemes.  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/companies-2/itcmaars-sees-induction-of-over-15-lakh-farmers-12759171.html,0,0.0

ITC measures annual consumer spending as the sum total of what consumer spends on buying goods of the company. It is the net sales turnover of the brands along with channel margins and taxes.  The FMCG portfolio of over 25 world-class Indian brands, largely built through an organic growth strategy leveraging institutional synergies in a relatively short period of time, &quot;represents an annual consumer spend of nearly Rs 32,500 crore and reach over 250 million households in India&quot;, the company said in its annual report for 2023-24.  This is 12 per cent higher than the numbers achieved in financial year 2022-23, when it had reported an annual consumer spend of nearly Rs 29,000 crore.  The company's reach has also expanded to 25 crore households from 23 crore a year ago.  The FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) businesses comprising branded packaged foods, personal care products, education and stationery items, incense sticks (agarbattis) and safety matches have grown at an impressive pace over the past several years, it said.  Some of its brands as Aashirvaad leads in branded atta segment. Similar Bingo leads in the bridges segment of snack foods, Sunfeast also leads in the cream biscuits segment.  In notebooks segment, its brand Classmate leads, while YiPPee, Fiama and Mangaldeep are the second players in noodles, body wash and agarbattis, respectively.  About the overall consumption demand, ITC said it remained &quot;subdued&quot; during the year, especially in rural markets and in the value segments.  This was &quot;amidst a challenging macroeconomic and operating environment and on the back of significant inflationary pressures in the previous year, consumption demand&quot;, it said, adding overall, input costs remained elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels with several commodities witnessing sequential uptick in prices, while certain commodities witnessed moderation in prices on a high base.  &quot;Notwithstanding the challenging conditions and heightened competitive intensity, your company's FMCG businesses grew ahead of the industry in both urban and rural markets driven by deep consumer insights, purposeful innovation, portfolio premiumisation, strategic portfolio augmentation, sharp execution of channel-specific business plans, enhanced distribution footprint and superior last mile execution,&quot; it said.  FMCG businesses recorded a segment revenue of Rs 20,966.83 crore, representing an increase of 9.6 per cent over the previous year.  While, segment EBITDA for the year ended on March 31, 2024 registered a growth of 19.7 per cent to Rs 2,338.50 crore with margins improving by 94 basis points on the back of premiumisation, supply chain efficiency, agile cost management and judicious pricing actions in spite of the gestation costs of new initiatives.  The Kolkata-headquartered company remains confident of rapidly scaling up its FMCG businesses on the back of a strong future-ready portfolio powered by purpose-led brands, quality, deep consumer insights, innovation and a resilient and efficient supply chain.  &quot;The businesses will continue to leverage your company's institutional strengths viz. strong backward linkages with the agri business, deep and wide multi-channel distribution network, cuisine knowledge resident in the hotels business, industry-leading packaging knowhow and access to robust R&amp;amp;D platforms nurtured by LSTC (Life Sciences and Technology Centre),&quot; it said.

The reports from proxy advisory firms, including InGovern Research Services, ISS and SES, come ahead of the June 6 meeting of shareholders of ITC to consider and approve the demerger proposal.  According to proxy advisory firm ISS, the demerger may unlock value for its shareholders and improve ITC's return ratios.  &quot;The structure will enable ITC Hotels to operate with an optimal capital structure with the ability to access capital to fund its growth requirements.  &quot;It can attract the right set of investors, strategic partners and collaborations whose investment strategies are more sharply aligned with that of the hospitality industry,&quot; ISS said in its report.  Last year in August, ITC board had approved the demerger of its hotels business into a separate entity. Shareholders of ITC will get one share in the soon-to-be-listed hotel entity for every 10 shares they hold in the company.  Highlighting the benefit of demerger, another advisory firm InGovern said that the current ITC shareholders will receive a direct stake in a dedicated, publicly traded hotel entity, becoming shareholders of a specialised company focused solely on the hotel business.  This move aligns with ITC's corporate strategy of fostering multiple growth drivers, ensuring continued interest in the hotel sector, and protecting against potential hostile takeovers in the future, it said.  &quot;Given the clean swap of shares which is beneficial for the minority shareholders as well as for the growth of both the companies, we recommend shareholders vote for this scheme of arrangement,&quot; it said.  Proxy advisory firm SES is of the view that the decision to keep 40 per cent stake with ITC, is a strategic decision to give stability and allow fair discovery of price and is in interest of shareholders. SES does not identify any major concern with regard to the proposed demerger.  Another proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, has also recommended the proposed demerger scheme.

IiAS pointed out that the board of directors has not clarified their intentions for the 40 percent stake in the hotels business. It remains uncertain whether they plan to sell this equity to a strategic buyer or keep it. IiAS is asking the management for more details on this issue.  &quot;While [the demerger] partially unlocks value, capital support will likely continue to be provided by ITC to the hotels business in its capacity as a Promoter,&quot; IiAS added  SES sees no concern regarding the valuations of ITC Hotels. It said, “Since ITC Hotels will have mirror shareholding (60 percent of ITC) and balance will remain with ITC, the valuation is immaterial at this stage. Further, as ITC Hotels will be listed value will be through a transparent price discovery mechanism. Hence, no concern is identified in this regard.”  The hotel segment is the smallest in ITC's portfolio, contributing only 3 to 5 percent to its overall revenue.

ITC reported a standalone net profit of Rs 5,020.2 crore for the March quarter, down 1.31 percent from the year-ago quarter, hit by flattish cigarette volumes and lower FMCG margins.  The profit fell short of expectations. A Moneycontrol poll of six brokerages pegged ITC’s consolidated net profit at Rs 5,114 crore, up 0.5 percent. ITC's profitability was impacted by a one-time gain in the base-quarter.

The brokerage increased its target price on the player to Rs 491 from Rs 488 earlier, keeping its accumulate rating intact.  Morgan Stanley maintained its outperform call on ITC, with a target price of Rs 506 apiece. The brokerage said that the cigarette revenue was better than its estimate, but the FMCG segment reported in-line earnings while the margins were improved for the hotels business.  Better monsoons would improve prospects for ITC’s agricultural business and its cigarette margin outlook for FY26. Also, the paper segment is likely to see business and margin recoup in FY26.  Emkay Global sees a growth of 10 percent in topline in FY26. However, the domestic brokerage cut its target price on ITC to Rs 510 per share, but maintained its buy call.  The cigarette business' earnings and volume growth surprised Jefferies, as the positive surprise led to the segment's EBIT coming ahead of expectations. The acute pressure in the agri and paperboard segment caused an overall earnings miss, per Jefferies.  A key factor to look out for will be the upcoming budget, that will be closely watched for any announcements related to taxation.

Throughout the week, it struggled to break free from this consolidation pattern, eventually closing with modest gains of approximately 1.23 percent. Despite attempts to breach the resistance at 22,600, the Nifty failed to sustain above it, and a sharp downturn in the final session led to the erosion of most of its gains.  From a technical standpoint, the Nifty is trading within a rising channel pattern, suggesting potential bullish momentum if it manages to maintain levels above 22,300 in the current week, with a likely target range of 22,750-22,800.  Additionally, the long-short ratio of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) stands at 39 percent, indicating limited downside potential.  Looking forward, immediate resistance levels for the Nifty are projected at 22,700-22,800, and a decisive close above this range could trigger renewed buying interest in the index futures. Conversely, a breach of the support at 22,300 might intensify the selling pressure in the markets.  As for the Nifty Bank index, it experienced a notable uptrend, rallying approximately 2,000 points from the low of 46,600 levels and ending the week with gains of about 1.32 percent. However, the breakout from the cup-and-handle pattern faced significant resistance in the 48,600-48,700 zone, notably near the previous top recorded on December 28, 2023 at 48,636.  Surpassing the 49,000 level appears challenging for the Nifty Bank, with support seen at 47,700; a breach of this level could potentially trigger further selling in the index.  Here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks:  Navin Fluorine International: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,310 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,095 | Target: Rs 3,700 | Return: 12 percent  Following its Double Top formation near the Rs 4,900-4,800 zone, Navin Fluorine has experienced a significant downturn, shedding 41 percent in price. However, in the last 5-6 trading sessions, it has found support near Rs 3,000 mark.  Concurrently, a Bullish Crab pattern has materialized on Navin Fluorine's daily chart, signaling a potential reversal in trend. Moreover, &quot;regular bull divergence&quot;* has been identified on the relative strength index (RSI) daily scale, indicating strengthening bullish momentum.  Based on these technical indicators, investors may consider initiating long positions within the range of Rs 3,270-3,320. The upside target for this trade is set at Rs 3,700. To manage risk, a stop-loss order should be placed near Rs 3,095, helping to limit potential losses in case the trade doesn't perform as expected.  NOTE: If the price is making lower lows, but the oscillator is making higher lows, this is considered to be regular bullish divergence.    ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 440 | Stop-Loss: Rs 412 | Target: Rs 480 | Return: 9 percent  After reaching a peak near Rs 475 mark on January 4, 2024, ITC has experienced a significant decline of approximately 16 percent. However, in the subsequent 18 trading sessions, ITC has shown stability by avoiding further declines and has instead consolidated within a range of Rs 400-416.  Notably, in the previous trading session, there was notable buying interest observed at lower levels, accompanied by substantial trading volume. From a technical standpoint, the formation of a bullish AB=CD pattern on the daily chart of ITC within the mentioned price zone of Rs 400-416. Interestingly, this zone also coincides with the 0.382 percent retracement level of a price swing that occurred between January 2023 and July 2023, as indicated on the chart.  Additionally, RSI weekly has reversed from 45 levels, which suggests a potentially lucrative buying opportunity.  Thus, one can buy in the zone of Rs 430-440, with an upside target of Rs 480 and a stop-loss would be placed near Rs 412 on a daily close basis.    Piramal Enterprises: Buy | LTP: Rs 926 | Stop-Loss: Rs 845 | Target: Rs 1,055 | Return: 14 percent  In September 2023, PEL reached its zenith, soaring to nearly Rs 1,140. However, it subsequently endured a substantial downturn, plummeting by 29 percent. Presently, the stock seems to have discovered a level of support within the bracket of Rs 820-850, suggesting a potential stabilization in its price movement.  Notably, recent market observations have unveiled the formation of a Double Bottom pattern on the daily chart, accompanied by bear-trendline violation on weekly RSI —a promising indication for traders. This confluence of technical signals presents an enticing opportunity for market participants.  In light of these developments, traders are advised to contemplate initiating long positions within the range of Rs 900-930. The anticipated target for this bullish trade is positioned at Rs 1,055, representing a potential upside opportunity.  To manage risks effectively, it is recommended to set a stop-loss level at Rs 845, to be evaluated based on daily closing prices.

","Foreign investors lowered their investments in FMCG firms in the March quarter as earnings could be blazed by simmering raw material prices.  The foreign institutional investors (FIIs) cut down their holdings in Hindustan Unilever to 12.67 percent, bringing it to the lowest level since March 2020, down from 13.65 percent in the preceding quarter, while their exposure to ITC declined to 40.95 percent from 43.26 percent, according to the latest shareholding data.  The FII ownership in Varun Beverages declined to 25.78 percent, marking a six-week low, compared to 26.57 percent in the previous quarter. Similarly, Britannia Industries saw a reduction from 18.99 percent to 18.23 percent. Dabur India also experienced a sequential decrease in FII ownership, down to 15.82 percent from 16.49 percent. Radico Khaitan saw its FII ownership decrease from 19.01 percent to 18.58 percent.  Varun Beverages and Britannia Industries hit a six-week low in FII ownership, while Dabur India and Godrej Consumer Products recorded their lowest FII ownership since December 2015.  Godrej Consumer Products saw a decline in FII stake to 22.56 percent from 22.94 percent, Tata Consumer's FII stake dipped to 25.46 percent from 25.62 percent, Marico's stake reduced to 25.55 percent from 25.69 percent, Colgate Palmolive India's stake dropped to 24.51 percent from 24.62 percent, and United Breweries Ltd saw a decline to 6.63 percent from 6.71 percent.    FMCG firms face pressure from recent spikes in raw material prices like crude oil, palm oil, coffee, and cocoa, potentially halting their margin expansion. Companies are cautious about passing on costs to consumers to maintain competitiveness and sales volumes. Few analysts said that the era of margin expansion is over, with revenue growth expected to be slow because of rising raw material prices.  Recent earnings reports show no significant volume recovery and highlight the challenge posed by rising raw material costs, which could potentially lower the consensus earnings estimates. HUL in its recent earnings urged investor patience amid continued sluggish volume growth in the FMCG sector. Q4FY24 sees a mere 2 percent increase, consistent with previous quarters, following a modest 3 percent rise in Q1.  Nestle shares dropped sharply last week following a Swiss NGO report alleging higher sugar content in its baby food sold in developing countries compared to Europe. The Indian government plans to investigate, according to reports. Nestle responded, citing adherence to WHO codex and local requirements, and voluntary sugar reductions of up to 30 percent in some variants. They emphasised ongoing product review and reformulation to maintain nutrition, quality, safety, and taste.

The company's arm ITC Hotels, which had opened 22 new properties in the last 24 months, plans to add another 70 hotels in the next five years in India as part of expansion plans in the hospitality sector. Besides the hotels business, the company will look for opportunities to expand the presence of FMCG and other verticals in new overseas markets as well.  &quot;We are open to exploring opportunities that come about. I think we have strong credentials in hospitality which we can take outside India now. Very clearly at the moment the focus is on proximal markets, be it for hospitality, be it for FMCG…,&quot; Puri said here at a press conference after the opening of the 352-room luxury property, ITC Ratnadipa here. He said as the company explores and understands a place for a particular business, it may look at it as a market for other verticals as well.  Citing the example of Nepal, Puri said,&quot;We started with other businesses and are now looking at hospitality (there). Here (in Sri Lanka) we have started with hospitality…as we explore and understand the place, we will look at possibilities in some of our other sectors as well.&quot; On overseas expansion of the hospitality business, while the company's focus is more on 'proximal markets', he said,&quot;We are open to it if there are some interesting opportunities beyond it. We will certainly be interested in pursuing that.&quot;  When asked if ITC is looking at the Middle East as a market for the hospitality business, he said it is a vibrant economy right now with terrific growth plans and &quot;if opportunity comes our way then we will certainly explore that&quot;. Puri also said the company will look to expand in more destinations in Sri Lanka going forward.  &quot;This (opening of ITC Ratnadipa) is the starting point and yes, we want to expand and grow the economy and contribute to the development of tourism in Sri Lanka,&quot; he said. When asked about ITC's overall expansion plans in the hospitality sector, he said,&quot;We have a very healthy pipeline of 70 hotels in five years.&quot;  All these 70 hotels are for the Indian domestic market and most of them will be the upscale segments. He, however, said &quot;(For) overseas we're just starting our journey. So we have not yet got to the stage to start putting a number right here.&quot;  On investments planned for the overall expansion, he did not share a specific number but said &quot;between renovation and new properties will spend somewhere between Rs 700 crore to Rs 1,000 crore a year&quot;. When asked about the progress of the demerger of ITC Hotels and its planned public listing, Puri said it is happening in line with the indicated timelines and is expected &quot;before the second half of this year or the end of this year&quot;.  At its new property here, the company had invested about USD 500 million. It was inaugurated on Thursday by Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The ITC Ratnadipa or 'Island of Gems' has 352 guest rooms, suites and service apartments, each with private balconies with waterfront views.  Earlier in the day, speaking at the opening of the new hotel, Puri said,&quot;It is very natural for us to specifically focus on markets in proximal areas, encouraged also by our Prime Minister's (Narendra Modi) vision of neighbourhood first where Sri Lanka has a very special position. ITC is deeply committed to growing our presence and contributing to hospitality in the region.&quot;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/itc-plans-to-open-more-hotels-overseas-cmd-sanjiv-puri-12708165.html,2,2.0

Besides being more liquid, large caps also appear attractively valued compared to the second-line stocks that have suddenly fallen out of favour ","When the market was on an upswing, mid-cap and small-cap indices had outpaced the Sensex and Nifty by a mile. A similar trend is playing out on the way down as well. So far this week, the mid and small-cap indices have fallen by as much as 9 percent, compared to a 2 percent decline in the bigger indices.  Analysts expect this divergence to continue as they see panic-stricken investors flocking to the safety of large-caps. Besides being more liquid, large-caps also appear attractively valued compared to the second-line stocks that have suddenly fallen out of favour.  Top large-cap stocks experts are betting on  Deven Mehata, Equity Research Analyst, Choice Broking  Maruti Buy: Rs 11,400 | Stop Loss: Rs 11,000 | Target: Rs 12,300  The stock is trading very close to its all-time high of 11,730 at 11,400 levels. The critical support level at 11,000, closely aligned with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), signifies historical buying interest and provides a foundation for the stock's price stability. Crucially, Maruti is trading above all significant moving averages, emphasising its underlying strength and positive sentiment.  On the higher side, once the stock surpasses 11,730 resistance, it can move towards 12,300 levels and higher. Meanwhile, 11,000 serves as a potential stop for downward movements. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 54.96, indicating a supportive environment for price gains. It's not yet in overbought territory, suggesting room for further growth.  L&amp;amp;T Buy: Rs 3,550 | Stop Loss: Rs 3,400 | Target: Rs 3,730 - 3,900  The stock has found substantial support around 3,400 levels. The recent robust bounce from this support suggests a bullish stance for LT. The potential for further upward movement, potentially reaching new all-time highs, is underlined by the stock's resilience at key support levels.  A breakthrough above the resistance at 3,635 could catalyze a strong upward movement, approaching the all-time high levels of 3,730 and beyond. This analysis suggests a favorable outlook for LT, supported by technical indicators pointing towards potential bullish momentum in the upcoming sessions.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live action  Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel One  TCS Buy: Rs 4,200 - 4,100 | Stop Loss: Rs 3,940 | Target: Rs 4,750  The IT giant has experienced an impressive rally in recent months, breaking out of a prolonged consolidation phase. While the broader market has been under pressure in the last few sessions, this particular stock has shown remarkable resilience and is now trading in uncharted levels. Looking at the weekly chart, we can see that prices have surged past a significant consolidation breakout pattern known as the 'saucer' formation.  Following this breakout, any minor pullbacks or consolidation phases have been met with buying interest. Despite indicators signaling overbought conditions, they also reflect the stock's underlying strength. Traders are advised to consider purchasing this stock at its current market price or on any subsequent dips.  HDFC Bank Buy: Rs 1,445 - 1,420 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,360 | Target: Rs 1,600  This prominent banking heavyweight has been a key contributor to the recent underperformance of the Bank Nifty. However, amid the recent market turmoil, this stock has shown resilience, displaying a relatively muted reaction and appears to be establishing a support base at attractive levels. This consolidation phase aligns with the long-term support of the 200-weekly moving average and is accompanied by robust trading volumes.  There's notable positive divergence evident, wherein although prices have reached new lows, oscillators have not, suggesting substantial accumulation of this stock at lower levels. Additionally, the recent closure of prices above the 20-day exponential moving average (20EMA) on the daily chart indicates a shift towards positive momentum in the short term. Given these factors and the favorable reward-to-risk ratio, we maintain a strong bullish outlook on this stock.

Further, the increasing deal sizes of MNCs’ Indian stake sales reflect the coming of age of Indian markets, he said in an interaction with CNBC-TV18.  Indian businesses of many MNCs are growing rapidly and the Indian market rewards these companies with extremely high multiples. Oftentimes, the underlying value of the Indian business is not reflected fully in the parent stock, Balakrishna said. That’s why it makes sense for MNCs to evaluate monetising part of the stake and using that as a tool for funding their operations or opportunities in other parts of the world, he added.  Earlier, this week, British American Tobacco sold 3.5 equity stake in ITC Ltd in a mega deal worth Rs 17,491 crore. The London-based company plans to use the sale proceeds towards its own share buyback, starting at GBP 700 million in the year 2024.  Bank of America was the adviser to British American Tobacco on the ITC stake sale. ITC shares jumped 8 percent in trade on March 13, following the stake sale by BAT, its top shareholder.

A few days after the stake sale, the MNC's CEO Marc Bitzer has clarified that there was no intention to quit India business and that the divestment was nothing but &quot;basic arbitrage&quot;.  &quot;In India we took our shareholding down to 51 percent. We believe in India for the long term, but if we have a business which is trading at 50 times multiple and your own company (parent entity) trades at a lot lower, it is basic arbitrage,&quot; Bitzer had told CNBC-TV18.  Also Read | Whirlpool to sell 24% stake in India business to reduce debt  Balakrishnan said that the deals also show the coming of age of Indian markets. &quot;In 2023, we had done a $400-mln trade in the block trade window and now the executed trade was 5 times as large. So certainly, it reflects the coming-of-age for the Indian markets,&quot; he said. Also, with the availability of capital that exists for those companies, private equity firms are buying the stakes and MNCs are selling, which is the reverse of what used to be the norm, he added.  BofA was also the adviser to Timken for 8.4 percent stake sale in the Indian arm for Rs 1,890 crore.  On being asked about MNCs looking to exit India in the pharmaceutical space, Balakrishnan said that he does not think that MNCs are looking to exit India but are rather trying to optimise their portfolios.

Sources told CNBC-TV18 that the DGGI has escalated its crackdown on nearly 10-12 FMCG companies, citing issues related to classification leading to alleged tax evasion. &quot;The DGGI has sent notices and investigation intimation letters to FMCG companies for paying a lower rate of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on products coming under the head of — extruded snacks and fried pellet snacks,&quot; sources said.  The government had, in 2023, clarified that any snacks that have been prepared by extrusion process should attract 18% and not 12% as is being paid by the industry currently. Extrusion is a technique to create ready-to-eat puffed snacks.  DGGI's preliminary estimates suggest significant revenue losses due to the alleged GST evasion. &quot;The DGGI has alleged ₹500 crore GST evasion by ITC Ltd, ₹300 crore by Prataap Snacks Ltd., ₹175.89 crore by PepsiCo India, ₹19 crore by Balaji Wafers, ₹39.14 crore by RP Sanjiv Goenka Group's Guiltfree Industries Ltd., and ₹68 crore by Sarveshwar Foods Ltd.,&quot; the sources said. &quot;We are unable to comment as industry-wide enquiries are ongoing,&quot; an ITC spokesperson stated in response to CNBC-TV18's query.  Responses from the other companies are awaited as the investigation unfolds.  Noting these investigations and communications from the government, the industry has made a detailed representation to the Finance Ministry seeking clarity on the matter so that future payments of GST can be made accurately to avoid any such future action by DGGI.  Experts say that the issue needs urgent clarification as the government’s view via the August 2023 circular is creating confusion for the sector and industry players.  “The entire controversy is an aftermath of the August 2023 circular, issued after the GST Council meeting, which divides the same food product into different rates based on whether such goods have been manufactured through the process of extrusion,&quot; said Abhishek A Rastogi, founder of Rastogi Chambers.  He has been arguing on rate classification issues for diverse sectors. Rastogi said: &quot;The higher rate clarified through a circular will have to cross the test of Constitution validity as arbitrariness and vagueness creep in rather than any valid clarification. Secondly, what amounts to extrusion has not been defined anywhere and, hence, to tax the same product at a higher rate when there is some mechanical process would lead to unwarranted results of a higher tax burden on the consumers.&quot;  He said a higher rate of tax on these products would defeat the objectives of the GST Council, which always wanted to keep the rates on basic necessary products in the lower tax category groups.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/dggi-initiates-action-on-itc-prataap-snacks-others-for-alleged-tax-evasion-12413751.html,1,1.0

The target price was kept unchanged at Rs 480 per share. From the closing price on February 28, this implied an upside of around 17.6 percent.  At 9.20am, shares of ITC were quoting Rs 407.7 on the NSE, lower by 0.15 percent than the previous session’s closing price.  So far this year, ITC shares have tanked around 13 percent. Goldman Sachs attributed this to the weak near-term earnings and the overhang of the British American Tobacco stake sale.  BAT plans to pare its stake in ITC from 29.03 percent to 25 percent.

ITC,2024-02-23T16:53:01+05:30,2024-02-23,Zoya Springwala,"Premiumisation driving growth, supporting margins in the face of a slower-than-anticipated rural recovery","To offset weak demand outside of metros and towns, companies are increasingly offering higher-quality but more expensive products","There are signs of nascent recovery in rural demand, but not enough to get consumer companies enthused. Inflation, a slowdown in government spending and erratic weather patterns are the factors weighing on consumption.  That is prompting companies to turn to affluent customers in urban markets to boost revenues and profit margins. The strategy is premiumisation, which is to sell more expensive, high-quality products to people who can afford them.  As demographic trends shift and a stronger middle class with a growing appetite for premium products emerges, firms have accordingly begun to increase their premium portfolio offerings.  ALSO READ: Rural demand lag hits FMCG firms in Q3; benign inflation, MSP hike, Budget augur well for recovery  Premiumisation buoys Q3 toplines, margins  Urban consumption remains quite strong, along with increasing spending in the premium categories. According to brokerage Bonanza Portfolio, the FMCG industry observed an annual consumption uptick of 6.8 percent in urban markets and 5.8 percent in rural markets for the October-December quarter.  Premiumisation is good for profitability as the products have juicier margins. During the third quarter, much of the chatter in FMCG boardrooms was about premiumisation.  Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) noted that the premium segment saw a 9 percent volume growth in September, October and November 2023, over the same months of the previous year. The mass segment saw a volume growth of 2 percent during the same time period.  HUL is on a drive to increase the share of high-end brands in its laundry detergent portfolio. It has introduced new ranges called Matic and liquid detergents for both their mid-range (Rin) and fancy (Surf Excel) brands. “As a result, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins of its homecare segment have expanded from 11.1 percent in FY17 to 20.5 percent in FY23,” noted Preeyam Tolia, senior research analyst, FMCG, Axis Securities.  ALSO READ: When will FMCG companies turn investor favourites again?  For Marico, the composite share of the foods and the premium personal care segment was at 20 percent of domestic revenues in Q3. The premium personal care segment made about Rs 300 crore in the quarter, and it's still growing.  Hotels-to-cigarettes conglomerate ITC also said that its FMCG division was focused on accelerating premiumisation. The arm's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin grew 100 basis points for the third quarter, with the expansion driven by &quot;multi-pronged interventions viz. premiumisation, supply chain optimisation, and digital initiatives&quot;.  Even the tobacco arm of ITC said that its premium category of cigarettes is performing well, despite recording a fall in overall volumes for the quarter.  Is the premiumisation push paying off?  The results clearly indicate premiumisation has helped improve or maintain overall margins (in percentage and absolute terms) in times of a slowdown in rural areas. Premium products are priced higher, but it doesn't cost the companies that much more to make them, allowing for higher profits. “If rural (demand) takes longer to recover, premiumisation (focussed largely on urban areas) will help in maintaining the top line in absolute terms and margins,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research, HDFC Securities.  Input costs may be easing, but that is turning out to be a double-edged sword for consumer companies. That is because smaller companies that had retreated because of high production costs are now back in the game. They are snatching market share from established companies in the mass-market segment, which is proving to be another driver for going upscale.  “As regional players compete harder in the mass end of the portfolio, the premiumisation agenda has been accelerated across more prominent players,” said Tolia. However, some analysts are sceptical if premiumisation is a sustainable strategy and if it can help make up for lower volumes.  ALSO READ: Daily Voice: Any rally from 22,000 on Nifty to be driven by FMCG, a dark horse, and private sector banks, says Amit Jain of Ashika Global  “This strategy performs well in categories where consumers value specific features and are willing to pay a premium. However, it's not a guaranteed solution,” said Sonam Srivastava, founder, Wright Research. Instead, companies must prioritise innovation, brand building and targeted marketing to drive demand, according to Srivastava. But the ayes outnumber nays for now.  “In the medium to long term, the outlook for premiumisation remains strong with rising income levels and changing consumer preferences towards luxury; we can expect the same to drive growth,” said Shreya Hanchate, research analyst, Bonanza Portfolio.  Aamar Deo Singh, senior vice president, research, at brokerage Angel One, feels the strategy is clearly here to stay, although its forms and structure will keep on evolving as per the market and pricing dynamics. “This is a very competitive space, and there is no dearth of creativity to develop strategies to counter any decline in volumes,” he said.  Rural recovery to affect premiumisation drive?  Given the confluence of factors affecting the rural sector, there is little demand for premium products in this area. The rural slowdown has largely impacted the mass and mid-market segments, as budget-conscious consumers might prioritise affordability over premium features.  The premium portfolio remains strong as it is largely urban-centric, where demand has not been affected much. “Hence, most companies are looking to accelerate the premiumisation agenda further,” said Tolia.  Still, companies should offer a balanced portfolio comprising premium offerings and value-oriented options catering to diverse needs, said Srivastava.  ALSO READ: MC Graphixstory | FIIs cut stake in frontline FMCG stocks on weak sales growth in Q3  Outlook for consumer companies  The general consensus is that the consumer staples sector including retail and FMCG is witnessing a slowdown primarily due to weakness in rural demand. Additionally, increased competitive intensity has further hampered volume growth.  One of the key focus areas for companies in the near term is to regain the lost market share from regional and local players. “In order to do that, companies have to ramp up their marketing spending. Further, they need to expand their distribution reach in rural markets,” said Tolia of Axis.  While the FMCG sector might have seen a slowdown, that doesn’t hold good for all other consumer-facing sectors. Retail managed to maintain its momentum, growing 18-20 percent, while airlines and hotels posted double-digit growth, aided by strong domestic tourism.  “Going forward, till such time there is an uptick in rural demand, the current scenario is unlikely to see a reversal. Any major significant change is expected post the parliamentary elections,” said Singh of Angel One.

Shares of Prataap Snacks surged almost 14% in early deals to hit an intraday high of Rs 1,344.65. At 9.41 am, the share was trading 8.79 percent higher on NSE/BSE at Rs 1,280.  It was in December that Moneycontrol first reported that promoters of Prataap Snacks were in discussion to sell a controlling stake in the snack makers. The report said discussions were being spearheaded by Sequoia Capital, which is a part of the promoter group and holds approximately 47 percent of the Indore-based company.  This move is seen as a strategic step by ITC to expand its presence in regional markets, leveraging Prataap's strong foothold in these areas.  Prataap Snacks also sells traditional Indian namkeens under the Avadh brand.  The decision to explore the acquisition comes after Prataap Snacks' discussions with Haldiram's, another major player in the snacks industry, fell through due to a mismatch in valuation, the ET report said. Similarly, negotiations with Bikaji Foods, another snacks company, also did not materialise.  Moneycontrol couldn't verify the report independently.  If the stake acquisition is successful, it will trigger an open offer for an additional 26 percent of the company.  Prataap Snacks made its stock market debut in 2017 but has since delivered a negative return of around 8.34 percent.  In December 2023, Prataap Snacks reported net sales of Rs 408.31 crore, an 8.08 percent increase from the year-ago period. Its net profit for the December quarter came in at Rs 10.79 crore, significant growth of 215.39 percent compared to December 2022.  ITC's strategic approach, known as the ITC Next strategy, aims to develop a future-ready product portfolio that caters to evolving consumer preferences.  With the acquisition of Prataap Snacks, ITC could leverage its strong distribution network to promote Prataap's brand portfolio, further strengthening its position in the market.  On February 21, Prataap Snacks closed 1.7 percent down at Rs 1,171 and ITC ended 0.7 percent lower at Rs 403.35.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/itc-eyes-47-stake-in-prataap-snacks-to-expand-regional-presence-report-12327371.html,0,0.0

","ITC shares briefly slipped below the psychological Rs 400-mark to a 10-month low as the market worries about the impending 4 percent stake sale by British American Tobacco (BAT), the largest shareholder in the company.  Analysts and traders tracking ITC said the proposed stake sale does not change the fundamental picture but could put pressure on the stock in the short term because of a supply overhang.  It can also create an attractive buying opportunity for investors due to ITC's strong brand presence and growth prospects in its FMCG business, broking firm Jefferies, which recently downgraded the stock to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;buy&quot;, said.  Also Read | Jefferies downgrades ITC on BAT stake sale update  BAT plans to pare its stake in ITC from 29.03 percent to 25 percent. The four percent it is looking to sell translates to around 50 crore shares worth Rs 20,000 crore at the current market price.  The availability of such a huge block of shares means that prospective investors looking to buy a large quantity need not buy it from the open market and risk driving up the price.    The floating stock in the system will increase after the stake sale, as some of the new investors would look to sell the stock at the first opportunity if they get a decent profit.  BAT’s moves  BAT has tapped Wall Street banks such as Bank of America and Citi to help trim its stake in the hotels-to-cigarette conglomerate.  So, who could be prospective buyers?  A key challenge BAT faces in offloading a 4 percent stake in ITC is navigating the regulatory hurdles imposed by the Reserve Bank of India on foreign ownership in tobacco firms, which limits who can buy those shares.  The complexity of divesting ITC’s shares is immense, BAT CEO Tadeu Marroco said in December. “There are specific RBI approvals that are required in respect of any action-taking about our stake, and this adds a significant level of additional bureaucracy,&quot; he said.  As a result, “the universe of buyers is limited'' for ITC shares, the CEO said.  But potential buyers also include large domestic institutions such as life insurance companies, mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds, global FMCG giants such as Unilever or Nestle, and private equity firms, said Atul Parakh, CEO of trading platform Bigul.  Hemal Shah, Fund Manager, Torus Oro, a PMS, said BAT could have a long list of prospective buyers, considering the strengths of ITC’s businesses.  Impact on tobacco, FMCG arms  Investors are betting on ITC’s FMCG business to drive growth over the medium-to-long term. The FMCG division has been showing good revenue growth, and ITC watchers are hopeful of an expansion in profit margins.  “ITC's strong brand presence and market leadership are likely to continue attracting investors, regardless of the change in shareholding pattern,” added Parakh.  The upcoming elections could be a short-term earnings driver for FMCG business, as it could lead to strong demand from the rural sector, said Shah.    But there are challenges as well. Volume growth in the mainstay tobacco business is moderating.  While the company’s focus on premiumisation and diversification could mitigate the impact, Sheersham Gupta, Director, Rupeezy, said, “The divestment is not likely to have an impact on these future projections for either segment.”  ITC Hotels to be divested by BAT?  Marroco also announced that the firm had no interest in remaining invested in a hotel company and might divest its entire stake in ITC Hotels once the arm was spun-off into a separate entity.

Even if BAT divests its holding, it will not hamper ITC Hotels’ growth,” said Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research, Profitmart Securities.  Instead, depending on the potential buyers of the ITC Hotels stake, it could benefit both companies: BAT receives additional capital, while ITC Hotels is provided with more autonomy, said Atul Parakh.  Attractive valuations  ITC shares hit a peak of Rs 499.70 in July 2023, but have since been underperforming. With the stock now 20 percent below its recent peak, analysts feel lot of the bad news has already been factored in.    “ITC shares are now available at attractive valuations as the company posted one of the strongest quarterly results. There are a few opportunities for investors in the form of ITC Hotels' demerger and growth in the FMCG arm. However, Investors should not expect the kind of returns the stock gave in the past two years,” said Sheersham Gupta.  On February 8, Jefferies downgraded the ITC stock to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;buy&quot; as the international brokerage expects the hotels-to-cigarettes player to remain range-bound. The international brokerage also slashed ITC target price to Rs 430 from Rs 520 a share.  At 1.41 pm, the stock was trading at Rs 407.20 on the National Stock Exchange, up 0.82 percent from the previous close.

ITC,2024-02-13T13:29:47+05:30,2024-02-13,Meghna Mittal,GST Council may issue clarification on expat salary taxation amid controversy,The clarification will be presented to the GST Council for approval once the law committee reaches a consensus on the matter,"The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council may issue a circular to address the controversy surrounding the spate of notices sent to Indian arms of foreign companies seeking to tax salaries paid to expatriates by the local unit.  The circular may clarify that input tax credit should not be held back for the period 2017-2022, as the practice of sending expatriates to the Indian unit, known as secondment, amounts to exports of services, people familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity.  The proposal may be placed before the GST Council once the law committee arrives at a consensus on the issue, they said. The GST Law Committee, comprising officials from states and the Centre, advises the Council on laws, rules, and procedures.  Some of the law committee members are of the view that input tax credit should not be given to MNCs for 2017-22, invoking Section 74, as GST is being recovered late because of acts of suppression by the MNCs. Section 74 of the GST law pertains to the determination of tax evasion and the imposition of penalties in cases where the tax authority finds that a taxpayer has intentionally evaded taxes under GST regulations.  “Centre is keen on issuing a circular in this regard to resolve the issue. The circular may clarify that Section 74 should not be invoked mechanically. It will resolve the issue to a great extent as the MNCs will get ITC for 2017-2022 and will only have to pay the additional interest cost. Some of the members of the law committee, however, are not keen to pursue this approach. The issue may be deferred to the next GST Council meeting till the law committee arrives at a consensus,” the person told Moneycontrol.  In the context of taxation, the act of suppression refers to actions taken by a taxpayer to conceal income, assets, or transactions to evade taxes. Suppression may include under-reporting income, overstating deductions, concealing assets or transactions and misrepresenting facts.  The revenue neutral issue  MNCs regularly send executives to India, where they work for a certain period. These employees are paid in rupees by the Indian subsidiary, and the entire cost is reimbursed by the overseas company. Thus, when secondment salaries are paid by the Indian employers, there is no business expense.  The local arms of MNCs are of the view that the salaries paid by them are outside the scope of GST and only part of the pay package relating to social security—that’s because these expats are usually eligible for social security in their home country—should be under the purview of tax.  However, the GST authorities believe that the entire salary comes under the scope of GST after a Supreme Court ruling of 2022 that said that secondment services are taxable. Thus, from 2022 onwards, MNCs pay GST on expat salaries and take credit for it as it is the export of services. Thus, it is revenue-neutral for the companies and the GST authorities.  But for 2017-2022, interest and penalty have been sought by the GST department. According to reports, the GST authorities have so far recovered Rs 2,500 crore of the tax for this period from the MNCs.  Expert speak  According to experts, these notices originated from a 2022 judgment by the Supreme Court, popularly called Northern Operating Systems Pvt. Ltd (NOS). The court ruled that when a foreign company supplies manpower to its Indian affiliate, it is to be termed as ‘service’. Thus, companies receiving employees on secondment from their foreign affiliates became liable to pay service tax for availing ‘services.’ Since GST is a successor to the service tax law, these companies started receiving notices under the GST law in 2024.  “These notices are issued consequent to the Supreme Court ruling in Northern Operating Systems holding that secondment of employees by overseas entities to Indian firms would fall under the category of manpower supply attracting service tax. Thus, judgement was rendered in the factual context involving reimbursement of expat salary and other allowances by the Indian firms to the overseas entity, and the court had ruled that it amounts to supply of manpower and therefore liable to service tax,” said Deloitte Senior Advisor Nagendra Kumar.  Rupender Sinhmar, a partner at BSM Legal, said, “Show cause notice now issued to these MNCs takes the lead from the judgment of NOS and blindly applies it on each and every expat transaction for the period 2017 onwards.”  Interestingly, in December 2023, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) issued a circular to the GST department not to apply the NOS judgment to every case of secondment and send notices. CBIC had also indicated that each secondment agreement must be analysed factually before applying the judgment and issuing a notice.  “These notices have been issued despite the CBIC instructions that in each arrangement, the tax implications may be different, depending upon the specific nature of the contract and other terms and conditions attached to it,” said Rahul Khurana, partner at Economic Laws Practice.  A few high courts have granted interim stay against the GST demands.  Effect of Bombay HC stay   Carmaker Mercedes-Benz, which received one such notice, approached the Bombay High Court last week and obtained an interim stay against the adverse action by the GST department. The HC has asked GST to file a response to Benz’s plea; the case is now likely to come up for hearing on February 20.  Experts noted that while the Bombay High Court is the latest to issue such a stay, earlier, the Punjab and Haryana, and Karnataka high courts stayed similar notices issued to BMW and Alstom Transport. “I will not be surprised to see more such interim orders by different High Courts in the near future, or since this is a pan-India issue, there is the possibility of even a transfer petition being filed by the Central Government before the Supreme Court to take this dispute to its logical end at the earliest,” Sinhmar said.  However, considering the case is yet to be heard on merits, the interim stays cannot be considered the final word on this issue. Afaan Arshad, leader of international tax practice at Nishith Desai Associates, said, “The court has granted time to the tax department to file a reply to the Writ Petition filed by Mercedes Benz and until such time has stayed the operation of the assessment order passed by the tax department.”  According to experts, fighting the GST demand in High Courts is the best option available to MNCs now. Sinhmar said, “Considering the fact that the GST Tribunals are not in place, it is advisable to approach the High Court challenging the very basis of issuance of show cause notice, especially in the light of the fact that most of these show-cause notices are mechanical,” he added.  However, some experts said these companies could also opt to adjudicate this issue at the GST department. “Depending on the facts of each case, it is open for the MNCs to either participate in adjudication proceedings and distinguish their facts from that of Northern Operating and also emphasise the instructions issued by the CBIC,” said lawyer Kishore Kunal.  Kunal said there have been instances before the NOS judgment when the GST department dropped such demands on being informed about the nature of the relationship between the secondee and the company.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/gst-council-may-issue-clarification-on-expat-salary-taxation-amid-controversy-12257161.html,2,1.5

The international brokerage also slashed ITC target price to Rs 430 from Rs 520 a share .  At 10.16 am, ITC was trading at Rs 420.05 on the NSE, up 1.3 percent, recovering from the pervious day when the scrip ended 4 percent lower  after British American Tobacco (BAT) confirmed its intent to divest stake in the company.  Over the past two to three years, ITC has had a good run with a strong recovery in cigarette volumes post Covid-19, which also led to a re-rating of the stock.  However, with the overhang from the BAT stake sale, two taxation events — the general elections and full budget from the new government —  over the next 12 months and slowdown in volume growth, Jefferies does not expect the stock to give the same kind of returns.  On February 8, BAT confirmed its intent to lower stake in ITC. &quot;We have a significant shareholding (in ITC) which offers us the opportunity to release and reallocate some capital. We have been actively working for some time on completing the regulatory process required to give us the flexibility to monetise some of our shareholding (in ITC),&quot; BAT said.  It holds a 29.03 percent stake in ITC, which is worth Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The firm has said a 25 percent stake in the company is enough for it to retain strategic influence.  “We don’t need to have more than 25 percent shareholding in ITC to have a strategic influence, including veto rights. Today, we have more than that,” BAT CEO Tadeu Marroco said in December.  Also Read | BAT prepares to pare stake in ITC  Jefferies said that a potential stake sale of four percentage points would be valued at $2.5 billion, creating a supply overhand.  “BAT has been facing challenges from declining cigarette volumes across its key markets, notably the US, where it took a $32 billion write-down recently. BAT also has $40 billion in net debt, which translates into ~3x Ebitda and nearly 60 percent of market cap,” the brokerage said.  Given the overhang, Jefferies reduced its target multiple on cigarette business to 18x from 25x.

ITC,2024-02-08T18:46:22+05:30,2024-02-08,Pavan Burugula,BAT stake sale in ITC won't require govt approval if sold to domestic entities,"However, if the potential buyer is a foreign entity then the same would have to be approved by the government, experts said","The proposed stake sale by British American Tobacco (BAT) in ITC will not need any prior approval from the Central government if the stake is being offered to domestic entities and investors, said compliance experts.  However, if the potential buyer is a foreign entity then the same would have to be approved by the government, experts added.  BAT CEO Tadeu Marroco on February 8 said that the tobacco company is looking to monetize its stake in India’s largest cigarettes maker ITC, where it has been a shareholder since the early 1900s. The ITC stake sale plan is part of BAT's efforts to create financial flexibility for the company at a time when cost of capital has risen sharply due to high interest rates.  The development assumes significance as Tobacco is one of the few restricted sectors in terms of Foreign Direct investment.  &quot;The pricing guidelines applicable have to be followed by BAT while selling the stake. Apart from that, the British company may be subject to capital gains tax for the stake,&quot; said a foreign exchange management expert.  BAT owns a little more than 29 percent in ITC, according to shareholding data.  Also depending on the quantum of stake , there could be other compliance issues.  A securities market lawyer said if a large quantum of stake is being sold by BAT to a single entity then the transaction will have to be looked into from a control point of view.  &quot;If the buyer is a single entity and the stake being offered is in double digits, the takeover code norms must be adhered to,&quot; the expert added.  To be sure, Marroco on Thursday told analysts that the company wants to continue to keep a level of influence in ITC, which means it will look to keep its shareholding at 25 percent initially.  “Local regulations require us to keep our stake at 25 percent to have veto rights. Our current stake is above 29 percent so there is space for us to reduce stake,” he told analysts in a post earnings call.  Shares of ITC fell 4.04 percent on the BSE to 414.45 per share after BAT announced its intent to sell part of its stake.  As of the stock’s closing price on Thursday, the stake sale by BAT to bring its shareholding down to 25 percent could fetch the tobacco maker Rs 22,240 crore.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/bat-stake-sale-in-itc-wont-require-govt-approval-if-sold-to-domestic-entities-12225421.html,1,1.1666666666666667

However, it is not clear how marginal farmers will benefit from it. Hence some announcements specifically benefiting the marginal are also expected.  Tune in to Moneycontrol for live budget coverage.  Some analysts are of the view that the money transferred under the government’s flagship direct benefit transfer scheme — Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi — will increase by 50 percent to Rs 9000 per year. The agriculture sector in the Union Budget 2023-24 saw a total allocation of Rs 1.25 lakh crore or a 2.78 percent share. This share was 3.36 percent in the 2022-23 Union Budget and 3.78 percent in the year before that. This shows a declining trend in percentage allocation to the agriculture sector. When it comes to promoting natural farming some budget allocation on research and development is desired by the industry.  Says Satyajit Hange, Co-Founding Farmer, Two Brother Organic Farms, “Organic farmers anticipate that the budget will prioritise sustainable agriculture, offer incentives for organic certification, allocate funds for organic research, and support market access for organic products, while addressing environmental and biodiversity concerns.”  With an aim to produce chemical and fertiliser-free food grains and other crops, the promotion of natural farming started in the Union budget 2022-23. It is widely believed that organic farming and natural farming help to reduce environmental pollution and improve soil health.  According to the Economics Survey 2023-24, during 2021-22 around 59.1 lakh hector areas were cultivated under organic farming. A substantial push from the government side is required in terms of awareness and incentives if the gross area cultivated under organic farming is to be increased, experts believe.  Neetika Suryawanshi, CFO, Pakka Ltd (a regenerative agri-abased solutions providing company), comments “Government support, encompassing infrastructure development, tax incentives, and funding for research &amp;amp; development, is crucial. Substantial investments in R&amp;amp;D are imperative to enhance technical skills, meet stringent quality standards, and broaden capabilities across diverse sectors.”  The industry expects the government to allocate some funds on R&amp;amp;D and spread awareness of natural farming.  According to the recent report by Jefferies on ITC, agri revenues declined 2 percent year-on-year (YoY) due to restrictions on agri exports. this was the case with other firms as well dealing in agri-commodities. Agriculture sector stocks on average delivered 33.49 percent returns since February 1, 2022.  At least three stocks from the agriculture sector have managed to more than double. Tarai Foods, Agri-Tech (India) Ltd and Indo US Biotech Ltd are among the little-known agriculture sector stocks that gained up to 189 percent since the previous budget.

Its hotels and FMCG arms performed better than expected when the company reported its third quarter earnings on January 29.  Total revenue from operations rose 2 percent to Rs 17,651.85 crore from the year-ago period. Prabhudas Lilladher had expected the company to report a revenue of Rs 17,700 crore.  The number also fell short of estimates of foreign brokerages such as Morgan Stanley, Jefferies and HSBC.  Profit, however, beat expectations, jumping 11 percent to Rs 5,183 crore.  Cigarettes hurt  A key reason for the top-line miss was the cigarette business, as volumes slipped 2 percent YoY as a result of a high base. Brokerages had projected cigarette volumes to expand up to 5 percent.Net revenue for the segment was up around 2.3 percent year-on-year.  Jefferies said the consolidation in the near-term volumes played out exactly like the company highlighted.  The premium segment did well but mass offerings underperformed, domestic brokerage Emkay Global said. “For Q4FY24, we are now building ~2 percent volume growth and see ~3 percent growth over FY25 and FY26. Positive volume growth outlook can be attributed to better execution, market share gains, and sustained innovation,” it said.  Brokerages do not expect tax shocks in the upcoming budget. The company has also been passing the tax hikes onto the consumer, which will lead to margin expansion, aiding high single-digit EBIT growth over FY 25-26.  FMCG surprises  HSBC said that ITC’s FMCG and others segment stood out with its 7.6 percent revenue growth and 100 basis points EBITDA margin expansion over last year.  The business delivered resilient performance amid slowdown in consumer demand, with staples, dairy, beverages, and homecare segments driving growth, HSBC analysts said.  The competitive intensity remained high in categories such as biscuits, snacks, noodles and popular soaps from local/regional players.  “Going ahead, while we see other FMCG growth in high single digits, profit is likely to be in mid-single digit, given cumulative PLI benefit in the base,” Emkay Global said.  As the demand improves, more local and regional players come into play in the FMCG segment and eat into the market share of  bigger players.  Also Read | ITC Q3 results: Net profit rises 11% to Rs 5,572 crore; interim dividend announced  Agri, paperboard segments underperform  Morgan Stanley said that the poor performance of the agri business weighed on the company’s topline. “Agri business should report a decline on a high base amid restrictions. Weakness in the paper business is likely to sustain in FY25,” Emkay said.  ITC Hotels surpasses estimates  ITC Hotels reported better revenue than estimates, said Morgan Stanley. Hotels continued to report strong performance, reporting their best-ever quarter, with 18 percent sales and 57 percent EBIT YoY growth.  Its plan to demerge the hotels business had been cleared by the stock exchanges, the company said.  Outlook  Factoring in the Q3 performance, Emkay Global cut its topline expectations by 3-4 percent over FY24-26E, which led to a 3-5 percent earnings cut.

At the current level of 23x earnings, ITC's valuation is “incredibly attractive” and the stock should see lower double-digit earnings as well, Jain said in an interview with CNBC.  While ITC was unlikely to see “multiple expansion”, its growth should still be quite significant, at around 14-15 percent, he said, adding the FMCG arm of the conglomerate had done incredibly well and finally come to fruition.  The hotels segment, too, would see value unlocked and further room for growth once it was spun-off into a separate entity, Jain said.  At 2 pm, ITC was trading at Rs 464.85 on the NSE, down 0.38 percent from the previous close price.  GQG Partners upped its stake in the hotels-to-cigarettes conglomerate in the third quarter of the financial year 2023-24 to 2.79 percent from 1.58 percent.  According to the current market price of Rs 463.9 apiece, GQG's stake in ITC is estimated to be worth around Rs 16,112 crore.  Talking about his Adani play, Jain said he believed in “opportunistic” investing and therefore entered the group’s stocks earlier last year. The Adani group stocks were hammered after American short-seller Hindenburg Research in a report late January 2023 accused the Adani group of manipulating stock price and falsifying records.  Jain double and triple-down on the counters during May-August, taking his investment in the group companies to a whooping $4 billion.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live updates  GQG Partners is also bullish on domestic infrastructure space. Jain said he also held positions in JSW Energy and JSW Steel.  According to Bloomberg Data, the foreign portfolio investor has increased its stake in India to around $9.9 billion in 2023 from $4.4 billion.

Notably, 2,358 of these identified bogus firms were detected by the Central GST Authorities.","The government announced on January 7 that GST officers have identified 29,273 bogus firms engaged in fraudulent Input Tax Credit (ITC) claims amounting to Rs 44,015 crore in the eight months leading up to December 2023. This discovery was made during a concerted effort to combat fake registration. The actions taken against these fraudulent entities have resulted in saving revenue amounting to Rs 4,646 crore. More significantly, the action underscores the Centre's commitment to curbing tax evasion and maintaining the integrity of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) system.  During the October-December quarter, authorities identified 4,153 suspected bogus firms allegedly involved in ITC evasion, totaling around Rs 12,036 crore. The Central GST Authorities played a role in detecting 2,358 of these identified bogus firms.  In the efforts to detect and address bogus firms involved in suspected ITC evasion, Maharashtra topped the list with 926 such firms identified. Following Maharashtra, other states with significant numbers of detected bogus firms include Rajasthan with 507, Delhi with 483, and Haryana with 424.  During the December quarter, the detection of bogus firms involved in suspected ITC evasion protected revenue amounting to Rs 1,317 crore. Out of this, Rs 319 crore has already been realised, and Rs 997 crore has been protected by blocking ITC. The finance ministry reported that 41 individuals were arrested in connection with these cases, with 31 of these arrests made by the Central GST Authorities.  &quot;Since the initiation of the special drive against fake registrations in mid-May 2023, a total of 29,273 bogus firms involved in suspected Input Tax Credit (ITC) evasion of Rs 44,015 crore have been detected. This has saved Rs 4,646 crore of which Rs 3,802 crore is by blocking of ITC and Rs 844 crore is by way of recovery. So far, 121 arrests have been made in the cases,&quot; it said in a statement. In Maharashtra, during the December quarter, the suspected tax evasion by 926 bogus firms amounted to Rs 2,201 crore. Authorities made 11 arrests in connection with these cases. Similarly, in Delhi, the suspected tax evasion by 483 bogus firms was Rs 3,028 crore, and 11 individuals were arrested. These figures highlight the magnitude of suspected fraudulent activities and the financial implications involved, underscoring the importance of robust enforcement measures to curb tax evasion within the GST system.  In Andhra Pradesh, the suspected tax evasion by 19 bogus firms amounted to Rs 765 crore. In Haryana, 424 bogus firms were detected, and the suspected tax evasion was Rs 624 crore.  For Uttar Pradesh, 443 bogus firms were identified, and they were involved in suspected GST evasion of Rs 1,645 crore. During the quarter, five individuals were arrested in the state in connection with these cases.  In a concerted effort to combat fraud in Goods and Services Tax (GST) and strengthen compliance, GST formations under the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) and various State/UT governments across the country are conducting a targeted drive.  The Centre has implemented various measures to strengthen the GST registration process. As part of these efforts, pilot projects involving biometric-based Aadhar authentication at the time of registration have been launched in the states of Gujarat, Puducherry, and Andhra Pradesh. The use of biometric authentication aims to enhance the registration process, increase security, and mitigate the risks associated with fraudulent registrations within the GST system.

The recent attainment of fresh life highs reinforces the optimistic market sentiment for the medium to long term.  Despite a notable instance of profit-booking in the current week following a fresh life high at 21,834 levels on the weekly chart, the Nifty maintains its higher top and higher bottom formation, underscoring a resilient bullish undertone. While there is some structural damage to the bullish trend on the daily chart due to a breach of the five-day low, the index found robust support at its 13-day EMA (exponential moving average), indicating a rebound and confirming the continued control of the bulls.  Critical technical indicators, particularly the relative strength index (RSI), consistently depict positive momentum, maintaining levels above 65 across daily, weekly, and monthly intervals. This sustained strength in RSI instills confidence in the enduring positive momentum in the medium to long term.  Looking ahead, the immediate resistance for the Nifty is identified at the record high level of 21,834, with an additional resistance level at 22,000. On the downside, crucial support levels are seen at 21,330 and 20,975.  Considering the overall chart structure, we maintain a bullish stance with specific targets set at 21,834 and 22,000 for the short to medium term. This analysis suggests a positive trajectory for the index, indicating a likelihood of sustained gains in the near term.  Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:  KEI Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,345 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,247 | Target: Rs 3,616 | Return: 8 percent  KEI is currently surging at its all-time high, sustaining a bullish trend that originated from the low in March 2020, showcasing enduring positive momentum. The stock exhibits a remarkable pattern of maintaining higher tops and higher bottoms without significant dips, portraying a robust upward trajectory.  The ADX (average directional index) study this week reveals a strong trend, with the ADX line surpassing the 30 mark. This shows the strength in the ongoing trend, while the +DI (directional indicator) above 30 further emphasizes the stock's robust momentum for a sustained upward trajectory.  Adding to the positive outlook, the concept of mean reversion is evident. Dips towards the short-term 12-week EMA and 26-week EMA consistently act as crucial support levels, contributing to the stock's bullish stance.  Looking forward, there is an anticipation of further price ascent towards Rs 3,616 mark. It is recommended to set a stop-loss at Rs 3,247, strictly based on the closing basis.    ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 476 | Stop-Loss: Rs 451 | Target: Rs 527 | Return: 11 percent  ITC is currently positioned approximately 4 percent away from reaching its all-time highs, indicating a robust momentum in the stock. Following a significant rally that commenced in March 2022, the stock is currently in the process of forming a healthy base.  During the retracement phase from the peak witnessed in July 2023, ITC found strong support and established a solid base formation around its 12-week and 26-week EMA. This highlights the resilience of the stock's trend. Furthermore, with the stock holding above the 20-week EMA, the bullish momentum remains intact, signaling the potential for further upward movement.  The MACD (moving average convergence divergence) indicator has played a supportive role, registering a positive crossover in the recent week within its positive territory. This affirms the stock's strong momentum and adds to the positive outlook. The ADX study, quoting above the 30-mark, and the +DI reverting upward from the demand zone further indicate the strength of the bullish trend.  Looking ahead, we anticipate further upward movement in prices, targeting Rs 527 levels. It is recommended to set a stop-loss at Rs 451 based on closing values.    Godrej Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 823 | Stop-Loss:Rs 784 | Target: Rs 903 | Return: 10 percent  Godrej Industries is currently positioned at its all-time highs, reflecting a robust and sustained positive trend characterized by a rising price structure and strong underlying momentum.  The stock is securely maintaining levels above its multi-year high, specifically from 2017. In the recent week, there has been a breakout from this zone, and the confirmation of the trend is evident through consistent trading with a significant surge in volumes, surpassing the 21-week average period. This surge in volume suggests anticipation and participation from larger investors.  Furthermore, the ADX study, currently quoting at 52, highlights the establishment of a strong trend in the stock. The accompanying +DI (positive directional indicator) above 30 reinforces the confirmation of a new uptrend, showcasing the strength of the positive momentum.  Godrej Industries is trading comfortably above key moving averages, including the 12-week and 26-week EMA. This alignment with the moving averages not only supports the positive momentum but also enhances confidence in the stock's upward trajectory.  Looking ahead, we anticipate further upward movement in prices, targeting Rs 903 level. It is recommended to set a stop-loss at Rs 784 based on closing values.

Once it is de-merged and separately listed, BAT would directly hold a 17 percent in ITC’s hotels business. “We have no intention to be in the hotel business,” BAT CEO Tadeu Marroco said early this month.  “At $2-3 billion fair value, hotel business stake sale could yield $350-500 million,” Jefferies said in a note.  ITC Maurya, ITC Grand Chola and ITC Maratha are some of the hotels operated by ITC. It also runs the Welcomhotel and Storii chains.

The BAT stock has underperformed other tobacco companies in the past three years. So far in 2023, the share is down 27 percent.

Given the news, Omkar Kamtekar, research analyst, Bonanza Portfolio, said the shares might see a minor correction in the short-term.  ITC has no promoters, instead the largest stakeholders in the company are FIIs and DIIs, who own 43.3 percent and 42 percent of the conglomerate, respectively. As of the September quarter data, the public held 14.7 percent.  Gaurang Shah, Senior VP, Geojit Financial, concurred with Kamtekar’s view, noting that the counter might see a reaction in the short term, but there is likely no lasting effect from the proposed stake sale in the long-term.

As a result, “the universe of buyers is limited” for ITC shares, according to the chief executive.  According to analysts that might be true in the context of finding strategic buyers. However, there might be enough appetite for the stock among institutional investors.  Follow our market blog to catch all the live updates  Gaurang Shah said that the question of whether the buyer will be a single entity or multiple institutional investors will need to be addressed, but given ITC’s performance over the past quarters, it shouldn’t pose an issue.  “The domestic money flow is very strong; mutual funds will be more than happy to buy out any stake,” added Rajat Mehta, CEO, Wealth Management, Mehta Equities. Omkar Kamtekar added that DIIs would see the sale as an opportunity to create fresh positions or increase their holding.  Outlook  “ITC continues to perform extremely well. It’s accretive for BAT in terms of performance,” Tadeu Marroco noted. BAT sees a longer runway for future share price outperformance in value creation in ITC, since there are plenty of opportunities for ITC’s share price to grow.  The company continues to be one of the top picks for analysts as the hotels-to-tobacco conglomerate solidifies its strategy. Analysts maintain an optimistic outlook on ITC, citing factors such as recovering rural growth, growth in non-cigarette segments, and the hotels segment being on track to list independently.  The stake sale will not have any bearing on the ITC Hotels spinoff, which should proceed as planned. “Considering the strong growth levers, value unlocking via the Hotels business and recovery in the FMCG sector as rural demand makes a comeback, ITC is poised to create long-term value for shareholders,” said Kamtekar.  Overall consumption growth has been better in urban areas, compared to rural regions, said Motilal Oswal, but signs of improvement in the rural markets are visible. The premium portfolio is thriving in urban areas.  After being the biggest meme stock of the past few years, ITC’s shares broke out of a multi-year consolidation phase to more than double investor wealth since 2022.

The supportive volumes further suggest a potential end to the correction phase, paving the way for an impulse move towards Rs 2,180-2,200 levels. Investors may want to keep an eye on this stock for potential trading opportunities.    Tata Power: Buy | LTP: Rs 276 | Stop-Loss: Rs 262 | Target: Rs 306 | Return: 11 percent  The stock has been undergoing an extended phase of time correction since October 2021, with prices ranging between Rs 275 and Rs 200.

However, it has been in a phase of time correction since April 2023, finding support at Rs 1,080-1,100 levels. The recent impressive range expansion on the bullish side, combined with a multi-month bullish breakout, suggests a shift in sentiment.

ITC,2023-11-24T17:58:43+05:30,2023-11-24,Pritha Pahari,Food products in unhealthy category account for bulk of FMCG sales in India,A large section of our population is on a diet that is detrimental to their longer-term health. ,"Despite growing awareness and a trend towards healthier lifestyles, a vast majority of Indian consumers continue to buy packaged food products that are deemed unhealthy. So much so that this category accounts for a third of total packaged foods revenue.  According to a report by Access to Nutrition Initiative (ATNI), a global not-for-profit organisation backed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Gates Foundation among others, of 1,901 products currently being sold by top 20 food companies in India, only 24 percent qualify as &quot;healthier&quot; products. These firms collectively represent 36 percent of the overall sales in the processed packaged foods sector in India.  ATNI's index methodology assessed companies using 58 indicators across seven categories, providing a comprehensive evaluation. The categories include product profile, governance, accessibility, marketing, workforce nutrition, labelling and policy engagement. In terms of “healthiness” scores among Indian companies, ITC emerged as the leader, followed by Hindustan Unilever, Nestlé India, PepsiCo India and Coca-Cola India.    A 'healthy product' is one that scores 3.5 or more out of 5 on a 'health star rating' model that rewards higher levels of fruits, vegetables and fibre, and penalizes higher sodium, saturated fat, and sugar content.  However, the overall healthiness of companies' products presents a concerning picture. The mean healthiness score was found to be 1.9 stars out of 5.0, consistent with the 2020 figures. Notably, substantial variation exists among companies, with over half (55.6 percent) of all products scoring 1.5 out of 5 stars or below. The report also highlighted that 12 percent of products were eligible for marketing to children, based on the WHO South-East Region criteria.  To conduct this evaluation, the index used the internationally recognised Health Star Rating (HSR) nutrient profiling model, endorsed by various governments. Products scoring 3.5 stars or more out of 5 in the HSR can be confidently promoted as healthier choices in public settings, according to ATNI's findings.  “This India index will serve as a powerful catalyst for driving positive change within the food and beverage industry in India. By focusing on private sector contributions to diet, nutrition and health, the index sheds light on what is working and what is not among the food industry.” said Greg S Garrett, executive director, ATNI.  This insight comes from a deeper dive into the efforts of seven out of the 20 indexed companies currently undertaking transformative journeys, aligning (re)formulation targets with dietary guidelines for sodium, saturated fat, and sugar.  Hindustan Unilever, ITC and PepsiCo India distinguish themselves by establishing targets to decrease salt, sugar and saturated fat in their products. Additionally, Hindustan Unilever and ITC have set goals to boost beneficial ingredients like fruits, vegetables and whole grains in relevant product categories, the report added.  Despite these initiatives, the study brings attention to a notable challenge—the absence of a universally agreed-upon definition of what qualifies as healthy food. Companies, it seems, are left to rely on their own interpretations, which may not align with each other or with internationally-recognised standards. The intricacies of defining and measuring healthiness in food products add a layer of complexity to the industry's journey toward offering healthier options to consumers.  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/food-products-in-unhealthy-category-account-for-bulk-of-fmcg-sales-in-india-11808471.html,2,2.0

ITC,2023-10-23T11:40:06+05:30,2023-10-23,Srushti Vaidya,ITC’s cigarette revenue growth takes a drag; should investors be concerned?,"Analysts are expecting a mid to high single digit growth rate in volumes for cigarettes, and a double digit growth in revenues, provided the tax regime remains moderate.","Tobacco major ITC, which sells cigarette brands Goldflake, Classic, and Bristol, is seeing a slowdown in revenue growth. Revenue growth for ITC’s cigarette segment has slumped from 29 percent in Q1FY23 to 8.5 percent in Q2FY24. Should this be a cause of worry for investors?  After ITC's July-to-September earnings, brokerages said that volume growth for ITC's cigarettes was lower than expected. Motilal Oswal had estimated a volume growth of six percent, but the actual growth was four percent in Q2FY24.  Analysts Moneycontrol spoke to said that ITC’s revenue growth from cigarettes has been moderating since Q1FY24, albeit on a higher base. The growth rate was higher in the last one year on account of factors like moderating taxation, growing out-of-home consumption, and weak competition from other listed cigarette peers, said analysts. A high base in the last financial year is causing a lower growth rate this financial year, although growth levels this year are comfortable, say analysts.    One of the reasons for high growth in the last fiscal is a moderation in taxes. Excise duty had increased at a CAGR of 16-18 percent over FY13-18 and it moderated with a 3-5 percent increase over FY19-23, said an analyst. “An increase in taxes on cigarettes over FY13-18 made cigarettes expensive, which in turn lowered volumes of listed players like ITC,” said a consumer analyst. The period of FY22 had seen a recovery in cigarette volumes. So, FY22 and FY23 was the period where cigarette consumption picked up and boosted revenues for ITC.   Excise revenue collection fell sharply as excise duty on cigarettes reduced in that period.  In the previous budget, the government increased the NCCD (National Calamity Contingent Duty) on cigarettes by 16 percent, but this did not have much of an impact, with cigarette prices increasing by a mere 7-12 paisa per stick. NCCD is levied as a percentage of excise on certain manufactured goods, including cigarettes.  Secondly, in FY23 illegal cigarette players and some other larger players were facing challenges that diluted competition in the market and benefited ITC, said Preeyam Toila, FMCG and retail analyst at Axis Securities.  After the pandemic, the sales of cigarettes saw a significant rise due to the increased out-of-home consumption, said Vishal Gutka of Phillip Capital. He mentioned that in FY23, people returning to offices contributed to the noticeable increase in cigarette sales during the same period.  Also read Why veteran investor Porinju Veliyath is betting big on Kerala Ayurveda  Volume growth is estimated to be in mid-single digits over the next two quarters, while revenue is estimated to be in double digits, said an analyst.  Emkay Global Financial Services, in a report on the sector, estimates that cigarette volumes will grow 3-5 percent over FY24. “From the core cigarette business perspective, we expect rational tax hikes ahead, given a higher share of the ad-valorem component leading to a build-up of volumes, which, along with an improving mix, would aid high-single-digit EBIT growth,” said the brokerage firm.  Analysts say that even though the growth rate for the cigarette business is slowing, it does not pose a concern for ITC.  Post Q1FY24 earnings, brokerages have maintained add/buy ratings on the stock. HDFC Institutional Research has an 'Add' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 450 per share. Motilal Oswal has a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 535 per share.

If the index can break this levels, it could move up to 20,300 and 20,500 levels.","The Sensex and the Nifty closed below their all-time highs on September 12 after rallying for seven sessions in a row. Midcaps and smallcaps saw a sharp fall, with 90 percent of stocks ending in the red. Midcap and small-cap indices recorded the biggest single-day fall of 2023.  The Nifty50 index showed profit-booking at the 20,000 mark after a strong rally from the 19,200 levels. This is not surprising as 20,000 is a psychological level and many investors may have taken profits at that point.  The next hurdle for the Nifty is 20,164. If the index breaches this level, it may move up to the 20,300 and 20,500 levels. However, if the index fails to break 20,164, it could come down to the 19,950 levels, which is the first and key support.  The overall trend of the Nifty is still positive and it is likely to continue to move up in the medium term. However, there could be some profit-booking at the 20,000 level and the index may consolidate for some time before moving up again.  Bank Nifty has also showed profit-booking in the last trading session after witnessing a breakout of W-formation above 45,000. The immediate resistance zone for Bank Nifty is 45,800. If the index can break this level, it could move up to 46,300 levels. However, if the index fails to break the 45,800 levels, it could come down to 45,100-44,900 levels, which is the immediate demand zone.  Here are three buy calls for short term:  Infosys: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,501 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,460 | Target: Rs 1,584 | Return: 6 percent  The counter has witnessed the breakout of an ascending triangle formation with huge volume. The breakout coincides with rising volume, and it manages to sustain above the breakout level despite weakness in the broader market.  It is trading above its all-important moving averages with a positive bias in momentum indicators. On the downside, Rs 1,475 will act as a strong support; below this, Rs 14,60 is the next support levels.  It is respecting its 9 and 20-DMA beautifully, which is a classic sign of trend strength.  Narayana Hrudayalaya: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,040 | Stop-Loss: Rs 970 | Target: Rs 1,160 | Return: 12 percent  The counter is in a classical uptrend where it is forming a symmetrical triangle formation after building a strong base at its 9, 20, and 50-DMA. A breakout will be confirmed when it crosses Rs 1,050.  On an immediate basis, Rs 1,050 is the horizontal resistance line; above this, we can expect a rally towards Rs 1,160 levels.  On the downside, Rs 970 is an immediate and strong support. Momentum indicators are positively poised to support the current strength of the trend.    ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 451 | Stop-Loss: Rs 435 | Target: Rs 476 | Return: 5.5 percent  After a classical move, the counter has moved into the consolidation phase, but it is trying to bottom out and will move towards Rs 460. The structure of the counter looks lucrative for long-term investors, as it is trading above all its important moving averages.  Both the RSI (relative strength index) and MACD (moving average convergence divergence) indicators are supportive of the current strength in the stock's momentum.  On the upside, Rs 460 is an important psychological level; above this, we can expect a move towards Rs 476+. On the downside, a cluster of moving averages at around Rs 435 is a strong demand zone during any correction.

The case of the missing biscuit unfolded when a Chennai resident, P Dillibabu, bought a packet of ITC’s Sunfeast Marie Light biscuits to feed stray dogs. The customer noticed that even though the wrapper mentioned 16 biscuits, there were only 15 biscuits inside the pack.  Dillibabu reached out to his local store as well as ITC for an explanation but did not receive a satisfactory response, according to Times of India.  He filed a complaint with a consumer court, noting that each biscuit costs 75 paise. In his complaint, he said that ITC manufactures 50 lakh packets of biscuits a day. Going by these numbers, the company is cheating consumers of Rs 29 lakh every day.  ITC argued that biscuits are sold based on weight, not number. The net weight mentioned on each packet of Sunfeast Marie Light is 76 grams. However, the court found that each pack containing 15 biscuits weighed only 74 grams.  ITC then argued that Legal Metrology Rules of 2011 allowed a maximum discrepancy of 4.5 grams in pre-packaged goods. However, the court rejected this explanation saying such exemptions are valid only in case of volatile products. The rule does not apply to biscuits since they don’t lose weight over time.  Moreover, the argument that biscuits were sold based on weight, not number, was also dismissed because ITC mentioned 16 biscuits on the wrapper.  The FMCG giant was ordered on August 29 to pay Rs 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practices. It has also been ordered to stop the sale of that particular batch of biscuits.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/itc-asked-to-pay-rs-1-lakh-for-putting-one-biscuit-less-in-sunfeast-marie-light-11319801.html,1,1.0

While the food plant will manufacture ITC's products including atta brand Aashirvaad, Sunfeast biscuits, and 'YiPPee!' noodles, the moulded fibre products facility will be a pioneer in sustainable packaging, contributing to plastic substitution in areas such as packaging for electronic items, FMCG, and the food and beverage sector.  &quot;ITC's investment in the food processing sector through the facility at Sehore is poised to add value to the state's manufacturing sector and support inclusive agri-value chains.  &quot;ITC believes that the food processing sector, being at the intersection of agriculture, industry and services, can make a multi-dimensional contribution to the state's economy by enhancing the competitiveness of the food value chain,&quot; it said.

This will certainly lead to improvement in volume, but it will not happen overnight, said Puri in New Delhi on the sidelines of the B20 Summit organised by the CII.  Over the ITC's plan for the demerger of its hotel business, Puri said it is going to benefit the existing shareholders by incorporating a wholly-owned new subsidiary ITC Hotels Ltd.  &quot;It will be a pure-play, focused on hospitality, which can leverage the institutional strengths of ITC. And ITC in turn will be able to leverage the synergy on its hospitality business, or its FMCG businesses,&quot; Puri told PTI.  It is a &quot;very robust&quot; model, which will help the business to make the hotel business accelerate progress, whilst retaining synergies and it will improve the financial metrics of ITC, he added.  Over inflation, Puri said this is mainly on account of two factors - the bigger one is more of the external factors in the geopolitical environment and the second is on account of the issues of climate change.  &quot;However, now, India is much better placed in the rest of the world and I would like to compliment the government for stewarding management of inflation and being extremely proactive in taking the right steps to control that,&quot; he said.  In the recently concluded June quarter, ITC and several other FMCG makers reported volume gains and improvement in margins. ITC has 25 brands including Aashirvaad, Bingo, Sunfeast, YiPPee, Fiama, Vivel, Savlon etc.  When asked about the revival of consumer sentiments and volume growth, especially in the rural market, Puri said, &quot;So we are already seeing green shoots of pickup on volumes as inflation is moderating. I think as inflation moderates, we are also seeing the prices in the market growing or climate is improving.&quot; He expressed concerns that the operating environment continues to remain volatile on the weather front.  &quot;Right now, the El Nino is the monitorable. The rains in August have not been very encouraging. That's the facet we need to be watchful about. But overall, I think we have been able to manage it quite well,&quot; said Puri.  The Kolkata-headquartered firm reported a 16.08 per cent rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 5,180.12 crore in the June quarter. However, its revenue was down 6 per cent to Rs 18,639.48 crore, impacted by its agribusiness division.  Its revenue from the FMCG-others segment, which houses businesses such as staples, snacks, meals, dairy and beverages, apparel, education and stationery products, and personal care products was up 16 per cent to Rs 5,172.71 crore.  Over the agribusiness, Puri said, India has &quot;tremendous&quot; potential for the agriculture sector and the opportunity is immense.  &quot;We have the largest arable land, we account for just about 3 per cent of the global trade on agriculture and because of... headroom to grow by vertical growth activity, and huge headroom to go through value addition and opportunities events, because by 2050, it is estimated that the world would need 70 per cent more agri produce to meet the needs of the entire planet,&quot; he said.  So it is an area of opportunity and we need to &quot;improve productivity, improve market linkages, and build resilience&quot; in the agriculture value system, he said.  &quot;And those are really the three things that need to be done. In ITC, We are trying to contribute towards climate-smart agriculture and the first part on productivity and quality or market linkages to the ITC Mars system.  ITC expects the public listing of its hotel business, to take place in the next 15 months. Its hotels business clocked its best-ever Q1 at Rs 600 crore in FY24.  Under the scheme of demerger, ITC Hotels will issue equity shares directly to the shareholders of ITC in a manner that about 60 per cent stake is held directly by ITC shareholders, proportionate to their shareholding in ITC and the remaining about 40 per cent stake to continue with ITC.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/seeing-green-shoots-of-pickup-on-volumes-as-inflation-moderates-itc-cmd-sanjiv-puri-11266151.html,0,0.0

The 3-year/4-year average volume CAGRs stood at 21.7%/7.0%, indicating strong demand momentum. With no material increase in Cigarette GST/National Calamities Duty, the volume growth outlook remains healthy. Unlike its staple peers, ITC has consistently posted impressive performance in the Other FMCG business (16% revenue growth and margin improvement despite elevated RM costs compared to pre-pandemic levels). The Agri business faced setbacks due to export restrictions, while the Paper segment was affected by demand issues, competition from China, lower pulp prices, and higher input costs. However, the Hotels segment reported a robust performance. We maintain BUY on ITC as we believe its earnings visibility remains better than peers’.  Outlook At a time when uncertainty looms over the industry, led by high inflation, unpredictable monsoons and continued weak rural sales, ITC’s recovery in Cigarette volumes offer decent earnings visibility at reasonable valuations and attractive dividend yield. We maintain our BUY rating with a TP of INR535, based on 28x FY25E EPS.

ITC,2023-08-14T15:02:19+05:30,2023-08-14,Moneycontrol News,ITC board set to clear hotels demerger today; investors eye sharper focus on core businesses,"ITC Q1 results: Along with the results for the April-June quarter, the company's board will also take a final call on the demerger of its hotels business later in the day ","ITC Ltd's board is expected to approve the demerger of the hotels business on August 14 when it gives the nod to Q1 results, unlocking value and sharpening the parent company’s focus as well as capital allocation towards the core businesses.  ITC will retain a 40 percent stake in the new demerged hotels entity, while the rest will be distributed among shareholders in proportion to their holding in the parent company. If an investor, for instance, owns a 1 percent stake, they will hold a 0.6 percent stake in ITC Hotels directly and an additional 0.4 percent through their stake in ITC Ltd.  The decision to not split the unit fully didn't sit well with the market. ITC share fell as much as 4 percent a day after the announcement nearly three weeks ago. However, domestic and international brokerages issued positive comments shortly thereafter.  Also Read : Value unlocking for hotels business, sharper capital+cash focus on cigarettes unit  Unlocking value  Global research and broking firms Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Nomura issued or maintained favourable calls on ITC stock, with target prices of just under Rs 500.  Morgan Stanley said the separation of the hotel business would alleviate concerns about the allocation of capital and the utilisation of cash flows from the cigarette business for other ventures.  The decision could assist ITC's hotels business in defining its distinct trajectory of growth. The brokerage maintains an “overweight” position on ITC, setting a target price of Rs 474, which encompasses Rs 17 designated for the hotels sector.  Also read: ITC Preview | Net profit may rise 4.6% in Q1, cigarette volumes likely to grow 8%  Goldman Sachs, too, was positive on the demerger, saying the hotels division was a capital-intensive component within ITC, contributing merely 2 percent to its EBIT but consuming 20 percent of the employed capital.  The firm assigned a value of Rs 12 to the hotels sector in its sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) evaluation, within its overall target price of Rs 470 for ITC.  Nomura regards the demerger as a strategic manoeuvre, potentially leading to the unlocking of latent value.  According to Nomura, the separation could facilitate enhancements in ITC's financial structure, capital distribution, and Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) metrics.  Another favourable aspect stemming from the demerger would be the surplus cash generated and an augmented dividend payout profile due to the elimination of capital expenditure requirements for the hotels segment, it said.  Nomura endorsed ITC’s decision to maintain control over the newly established entity. It has a “buy” call on ITC, with a target price of Rs 485.  Domestic brokerages Emkay and Nuvama’s target prices are above Rs 500.  Emkay Financial Services said it would await greater clarity regarding ITC's rationale behind retaining a 40 percent stake in the newly formed entity, the structure of royalties, potential tax implications and the principal criteria for securing a strategic investor or partner for the venture.  Emkay said it anticipates further value unlocking for ITC as the company looks to secure a strategic business investor. The brokerage retained its “buy” recommendation for the stock, with a target price of Rs 525.  Nuvama put the target price at Rs 560, saying the demerger would unlock shareholder value. Prabhudas Lilladher raised its target price from Rs 455 to Rs 478, while upholding its “accumulate” recommendation.  ITC's share price has fallen over 5 percent since July 24, when in-principle nod was given to the split, to Rs 449.20 on August 19. It has returned over 34 percent this year against the under 7 percent rise in the Nifty.

ITC,2023-08-10T08:40:37+05:30,2023-08-10,Tushar Goenka,"D2C consolidation: Value creation for FMCG majors, wealth creation for founders",Smaller D2C companies have struggled to convince financial investors to fund them and have sought refuge under the wings of traditional FMCG players,"Legacy fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are quickly moving away from selling just hair oil and other traditional products. As these giants diversify into health supplements, herbal products and other categories from the premium segment, founders of direct-to-consumer (D2C) companies are cashing in.  This year alone, FMCG giants such as Marico and ITC have announced several acquisitions. While ITC bought a stake in Yoga Bar, a healthy-snack startup, for Rs 175 crore, VLCC bought shares in men’s grooming company, Ustraa, for Rs 250 crore. More recently, Marico, continuing on its acquisition spree, paid Rs 369 crore for part ownership in Plix. In the past it has also invested in True Elements, Just Herbs and Beardo to widen its portfolio of digital brands.  While these are strategic investments for large FMCG players, thanks to the tech capabilities and customer database they get in exchange, they have turned out to be slump sales for D2C startups in most cases because founders were unable to scale up their businesses beyond a point and those businesses ended up being available at a steep discount.  “It’s a distress sale for D2C companies 95 percent of the time but a win for FMCG players. All these D2c startups are jumping for somebody to give a cheque to them,” said Ankur Bisen, retail head, consumer products and food, Technopak Advisors. He added that the industry now had “a problem of plenty, where not every investor is jumping onto the D2C bandwagon. They're selective and are cherry picking. It's a buyer’s market now, not a seller’s market.”  While scaling revenues from Rs 2 crore to Rs 20 crore is a 10X jump, the potential of the business cannot be gauged based on an increase that sharp.  “Any founder saying they’re selling for synergy purposes at the Rs 50-100 crore level does not make sense. There is no synergy there. At that scale, businesses don't even scratch 0.5 percent of whichever opportunity there is. D2C businesses start to mature only at the Rs 600-1,000 crore level, not before that,” Bisen added.  Interestingly, Plix, Yoga Bar and Ustraa individually had revenue below Rs 70 crore as of FY22, the latest available data on Tracxn showed. Even True Elements, Just Herbs and Beardo separately did not have revenues of more than Rs 70 crore in FY22.  Money matters  Each of the companies mentioned above, however, got a revenue multiple of anywhere between 3 and 7 while getting sold, which means investors and founders made money for themselves during the transactions.  “The primary decision to sell off Beardo was wealth creation. We now have enough money to sustain our lifestyle for the next couple of decades,” said Ashutosh Valani, the co-founder and former CEO of Beardo.  Marico’s acquisition of Beardo was among the first few instances where an FMCG player bet on a new-age D2C player, back in 2017.  “Every founder must have an end goal. Some of the deals happening now are with first-time founders so they’re still figuring out their end goal. A few of those deals are also distress sales where founders have been in the business for 5-10 years but are not able to bring an outcome. However, they’ve still been able to sell to a large FMCG player by chance, and that is probably the most positive outcome for them,” Valani added.  Not just Valani, another founder agreed that the sale to a larger player was driven by the money aspect of the deal.  “Look, I'm a young founder, I want to reap the benefits of what I’ve built. Rs 1,000 crore in the bank at the age of 70 is not as valuable as a couple of $100 mills (millions) in my bank account today,” said a founder, who sold their D2C startup to a large FMCG player, asking not to be named.  Last resort  While some D2C players like Boat and Mamaearth have been able to mop up funds and play the long game on their own, the smaller players have struggled to convince financial investors because of which they have sought refuge under the wings of traditional FMCG players.  Sreejith Moolayil, co-founder of True Elements, a snacks and breakfast company that Marico acquired in 2022, says that food D2C startups especially are on the backfoot when it comes to raising money from venture capitalists (VCs) or private equity (PE) players.  “When I was pitted against a personal care company in front of PE, they saw that the market here (food company) was still nascent, the margins are better in beauty and personal care (BPC); BPC penetration is higher than food, so we were always on the losing side of things,” Moolayil said.  The sale to Marico has opened up distribution channels and its offline reach helped True Elements grow.  Another founder agreed that it was difficult to raise VC money and that is when a large FMCG player provided support. “We could not get VC money. We saw good traction during COVID but then came the lull, when we realised that for the next 2-3 years, we wouldn’t get back that demand and if we didn't have deep pockets, we wouldn’t be able to scale up. Then a strategic investor came through,” the founder said.  Looking for an out  Founders also said it was important to time their exit and choose a strategic investor over a financial one, when it made more business sense.  “...one should decide and time their exit when they know the markets are so difficult that equity dilution makes absolutely no sense. There is a rule book, for every Rs 1 that you raise, it has to result in at least Rs 4 of stable revenue. If that multiple does not play out, one is better off selling the company today rather than continuing,” said Suhasini Sampath, co-founder of Yoga Bar.  The reach of her company’s products will go from 5,000 stores to 20,000 stores only because of the sale to ITC. It would have otherwise stagnated.  “For players like us, it makes sense to choose a strategic partner (ITC), because we’re not going to be constrained by the capital availability in the market now,” she added.  Different FMCG players structure their deals differently. While Sampath said in three years’ time, ITC will compulsorily acquire 100% of Yoga Bar, Marico has other ideas.  Marico has the first right to fully buy out its companies after three years and integrate with the larger brand, but it can also choose to let founders continue to run the business after that timeline.  “Marico is a strategic investor of choice as we believe in incentivizing the promoters to bring a company to its maximum potential,” a senior official from Marico said.  Large FMCG players take about double the time to create similar products in-house and hence an acquisition works better and cheaper for them, experts added.  “The acquisitions of digital-first brands are strategic in nature and help expand the addressable market within categories of interest. We don't acquire just for the sake of bringing more brands under our fold. The idea is to diversify our portfolio from traditional hair oiling and the mass segment to super premium segments” Marico's senior official concluded.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/d2c-consolidation-value-creation-for-fmcg-majors-wealth-creation-for-founders-11137551.html,2,2.0

The report further stated that the next course of action is likely to be taken in a board meeting which is slated to be held on August 14.  ITC however did not comment on its decision to list ITC hotels in the next to six to nine months. The conglomerate cited an intimation to the stock exchanges from July 24 that states that the scheme of arrangement shall be placed for approval of the board at its next meeting to be convened on August 14.  The intimation to the bourses states that appropriate announcements and public disclosures in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Board of India's listing regulations and other applicable laws will be made as necessary.  The Board of ITC Limited granted in-principle approval for the demerger of the hotels business under a scheme of arrangement, the company said in a regulatory filing on July 24.  The proposed restructuring would pave the way for the hotel business to operate as a separate entity in the rapidly expanding hospitality industry, focusing on its growth path with an optimal capital structure.  Market participants were hoping for a split mirroring the shareholding pattern. ITC has decided to withhold 40 percent of the newly-carved-out hotel company, and distribute only 60 percent to shareholders.  Markets have been gung-ho about the de-merger because the hotels business has been a drag in ITC’s books. Since hotels are a capital-intensive business, it has always delivered significantly lower return on capital than ITC’s other businesses.  Investors have been excited about the possibility of a demerger so they have the option of staying with ITC’s high-returns businesses, without having to necessarily stay with a business that yields sub-optimal returns.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/itc-hotels-could-be-listed-in-next-nine-months-says-report-11101301.html,2,2.0

Earlier, ITC chairman and managing director Sanjiv Puri had said that the demerger of the conglomerate's hotel business is “very much on the table” after the sector recovered after Covid-19.  Recently, foreign broking firm Jefferies raised ITC's target price to Rs 530 from Rs 520 on shift to asset-right strategy for hotels.  &quot;ITC Hotels is the second largest listed chain.

ITC,2023-06-23T17:31:20+05:30,2023-06-23,Shailaja Mohapatra,Underperformance in Nifty FMCG lurking around the corner?,"A slight delay in monsoon has already pushed Kharif sowing by 10 to 15 days, as per Skymet","As markets flirt with all-time high levels, the Nifty FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) index has also been on a roll.  The index hit its peak of 52,540.50 on June 16 and is now 2 percent below that level. Since March, the index has rallied almost 18 percent. Heavyweights ITC, Hindustan Unilever and Britannia have also gained close to 15 percent. ITC, which commands over 30 percent weightage in the index, has contributed to most of this rally.  But now, technical indicators suggest that the rally is done and dusted. &quot;At the current juncture, the index has given a bearish divergence pattern in the weekly time frame. Weakness is possible till 48,000 if it fails to hold 50,500. Currently, it has huge resistance around 52,500,&quot; technical analyst Dinesh Nagpal told Moneycontrol.  On the higher side, the index may fail to sustain above 52,500 levels. &quot;Many components of the index are in the overbought zone, including Britannia and ITC. Only a decisive move beyond 52,500 will have bullish medium-term implications,&quot; believes Anuj Dixit, Executive VP- Equity Research, Sovereign Global said.  Not just technical levels, fundamental factors too are not working in favour of the consumer pack. Here's why:  Price growth tapers off  FMCG companies clocked double-digit sales growth in FY23 as they hiked prices to mitigate the rising cost of raw materials, especially palm oil. Volume growth took a backseat as price hikes helped FMCG companies protect their topline.  Now, raw material prices have tapered off. Palm oil prices are down over 20 percent from the highs hit after the Ukraine-Russia war. According to Elara Capital, palm oil comprises 10 percent of HUL's raw material cost, 23 percent of Godrej Consumer's and 16 percent of Britannia.  This means margin comfort is here but price-led benefits will fade. &quot;The FMCG sector seems well poised in H1 FY24 with raw material cost tailwind. However, in H2 FY24 we expect revenue growth to moderate as pricing benefits should fade and growth would have to be volume-led,&quot; according to Kunal Vora, Head - India Equity Research.  Moreover, mature categories like hair oil and oral care have seen only 3-4 percent revenue CAGR over the last 7 years.  Can volume growth show the way?  Over the past few years, rural volume growth has remained elusive for FMCG companies. Premiumisation and urban markets have led the way. Going forward, the picture for rural volumes does not look too bright.  &quot;Commentary on rural remains underwhelming, and pick-up may take time, with El Niño also posing a threat in the short term,&quot; according to Jefferies.  The FMCG market (urban and rural) registered flat volume growth in the March quarter, as per Nielsen data. In a Q4 earnings concall, Hindustan Unilever's managing director and chief executive officer Sanjiv Mehta said that the overall FMCG market's volume growth should be 4-5 percent while commodity prices remain steady, only then the volatile scenario can turn a corner.  The risk of El Nino  When it comes to the impact of El Nino, surveys conducted by different brokerages suggest different results. For instance, ICICI Securities did an empirical study of 4 decades of monsoon patterns and came to the conclusion that discretionary demand (car and especially tractors) is more linked to rainfall than agri and consumer staples.  According to economists, an intense El Nino that severely disrupts the monsoon could push inflation up by 15-20 basis points by boosting food prices. A slight delay in monsoon has already pushed Kharif sowing by 10 to 15 days, as per Skymet.  In this regard, it is important to monitor the management commentary of FMCG companies after Q1 FY24 earnings.

ITC,2023-06-13T11:16:45+05:30,2023-06-13,Shailaja Mohapatra,"Foreign investors flocked to Varun Beverages, Britannia in past three years","A Moneycontrol study showed that of the top 10 consumer companies by market cap, FIIs upped stakes in seven, including these two","Ye dil maange more - That's what foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are saying to Pepsi bottler Varun Beverages. They don't want Pepsi; they want the shares. From 19.82 percent in March 2020, FII stake in this consumer stock increased to 26 percent by the end of March 2023.  According to a Moneycontrol analysis of the top 10 consumer companies by market capitalisation, FIIs have increased stakes in seven. The biggest jump has come in Varun Beverages, Britannia, and Tata Consumer Products.   For Varun Beverages, the optimism largely comes from the company expanding its high-margin businesses. One example is Sting. The energy drink Sting has been positioned at a favourable price point, attracting the masses.  Due to the higher mix of Sting, the company's net realisation per case came in at Rs 174 for Q1 CY23, up 10 percent year-on-year (YoY). Sting, along with other energy drinks, will soon be 15 percent of the portfolio, said Chairman Ravi Jaipuria in the latest earnings concall.  &quot;VBL has seen 15 percent organic volume growth in the last three years, led by distribution expansion in underpenetrated territories and new launches (Sting, milk-based beverages, etc.),&quot; according to ICICI Securities.  For Britannia, FIIs seem to have taken heart from the fact that the Good-Day biscuit maker managed to defend its margins during the pandemic. While the operating margins of most FMCG companies slumped due to high raw material prices, Britannia's remained consistent at 16-17 percent over the past three years.  Morgan Stanley, which has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 5,300, said Britannia's March quarter beat on estimates was entirely margin-led. The management’s focus is to build for the next 100 years, unlike investors who may overemphasise short-term margins, it added.  Moreover, consumer preference is towards large, trusted, and organised brands in times of hyperinflation.  &quot;Investors with long-term bias and patience are likely to be rewarded as formalisation will be more visible in the food space, given a higher share of the unorganised sector, who are themselves grappling with supply chain challenges,&quot; according to analysts at Philip Capital.  Tata Consumer Products, too, saw a jump in FII stake over the past three years ― from 18.15 percent in March 2020 to 25.04 percent in March 2023. During this period, the stock gained over 150 percent.  While the company's international coffee business was reeling under inflationary pressure, its India food business held fort. The India business has a higher margin, especially the branded business at around 14 per cent and international business at 11 per cent.  Recently, the company's Chairman N Chandrasekaran said that they are open to acquisitions and expanding into new categories. &quot;India’s business growth would continue to outpace that of the international market, with the percentage of revenue from the Indian market expected to increase,&quot; he said.  What about ITC? FII stake in retail favourite ITC has remained steady at about 14 percent, despite the 150 percent rally in the stock price over the past three years. While the company is firing on all cylinders ― cigarettes, FMCG, and hotels, the perception of a 'sin stock' is hard to shake off. That said, FIIs' stake in the company is at a historically high level.

ITC,2023-06-03T17:30:15+05:30,2023-06-03,Moneycontrol News,ITC and TCS in league of highest dividend-paying stocks in Asia Pacific: CLSA,Most retail investors when buying stocks focus more on capital appreciation than the potential of sustained dividend. That is why they should pay special attention to brokerage CLSA’s latest edition of Bits and Pieces,"When asked what made him most happy about investing, legendary investor the late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala had once replied in jest, ‘When the dividends come in June’.  Most retail investors though when buying stocks focus more on capital appreciation than the potential of sustained dividend. That is why they should pay special attention to brokerage CLSA’s latest edition of Bits and Pieces by Damian Kestel.    In its weekly newsletter, the foreign broking firm reiterates that dividends make a significant contribution to total return over time. The classic example that it cites is Warren Buffett’s dividend bonanza over the years from Coca-Cola.  In 1994, Berkshire Hathaway received $75 million cash dividend from Coke. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Given the total cost of purchase was $1.3 billion, the dividend yield comes to ~50 percent for 2022.  Noting this, CLSA calculated what the yield in 2023 would be on some Asia Pacific large caps if an investor was lucky enough to buy at a 15-year low and receive a 2023 dividend.  In the past ten years, the MSCI Asia Pacific index is up 18.8 percent in price. &quot;But, if dividends were re-invested then the index would have been 57 percent higher,&quot; according to the latest Bits &amp;amp; Pieces report.  Among names like Samsung, TSMC and Macquarie, India's Tata Consultancy Services and ITC find a spot in CLSA's list.  If an investor had purchased TCS stock at a 15-year low of Rs 103.5, he/she would stand to receive Rs 124 in dividend, indicating a yield of a whopping 120 percent.  Similarly, ITC fetches a yield of 36 percent on its 15-year low price which, in Kestel's words, is &quot;not bad for a sin stock&quot;. ITC's dividend per share keeps rising under an improved capital allocation policy, which offers good support to the stock, according to the broking firm.  Another Indian stock that catches CLSA's eye is PowerGrid. The company raised its dividend by 26 percent year-on-year to Rs 14.75 in FY23. Moreover, it also said in an analyst call that it does not intend to hoard cash which only means consistent dividend growth in coming years.  Though Vedanta is one of the highest dividend-paying stocks in India, CLSA highlighted in its report that it is more to do with cash requirement at the parent level to pay off debt rather than rewarding investors.  The bottom line: a dividend is a gift that keeps on giving. &quot;Financial magic can occur when you invest in a company with a policy (and the operational means) of increasing its dividends and then go to the beach,&quot; writes Kestel.

Most analysts expect the trend to continue in the coming quarters.  &quot;We remain cautiously optimistic, expecting mid-single-digit volume growth as the near-term operating environment continues to be challenging. Considering price cuts and increased royalty rate at 3.45 percent, we trimmed our earnings and retain 'ADD' rating,&quot; Centrum Broking said.  No such problems for ITC, whose FMCG business posted impressive figures on both growth and profitability fronts. Cigarette volumes shot up 12 percent YoY, helped also by clawback from illicit trade, while the hotels segment was lifted by the post-Covid revival in travel, which offset the weakness in paperboard and agribusinesses.  &quot;Unlike its staples peers, ITC has reported consistently impressive performance in its Other FMCG business (19 percent revenue growth and margin improvement despite elevated raw material costs), along with robust performance in Hotels. ITC’s earnings visibility remains better than peers,&quot; analysts at Motilal Oswal said.  &amp;nbsp;    Market Moves: ITC shares have been hogging the limelight since the past year, and have emerged as the top Nifty gainer. HUL’s performance has been sedate in comparison. But a bit of context may be useful here -- HUL edges past ITC when it comes to their five-year returns.  Analyst Views: Very little to choose between the two, as both companies feature prominently on ‘buy’ lists. With zero ‘sell’ calls, ITC has a near-perfect score on the sentiment meter, though HUL has reasserted its position with an increase in ‘buy’ ratings post the Q4 results.  &amp;nbsp;    Valuations: HUL has traditionally commanded a higher price multiple than ITC, in line with most consumer staple firms. At a 1-year forward P/E of 52.69, HUL is trading well above its 10-year average of 46.5x.  ITC’s price multiple of 25.4x too is above its 10-year average of 22.16. Incidentally, ITC has among the lowest P/E ratios in the Nifty FMCG index, mainly due to the tax overhang on cigarettes, though the situation may be turning favourable for the company.  “The key challenges for ITC – an extremely punitive tax regime of the past, Covid-related disruption and commodity cost inflation – now seem to be receding,” according to Motilal Oswal.  However, analysts said the ITC stock’s recent run-up limits its further rerating potential, which means the P/E gap with HUL is expected to remain in the medium term.

The winner of the race could shell out anywhere between Rs 4,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore in a deal to acquire the maker of Ching’s Secret and Smith &amp;amp; Jones food ingredients, the report quoted sources as saying.  “Nestle’s bid is the highest. ITC’s bid is very close to that,&quot; according to a source who is in the know of the deal.  Nestle SA has been in talks with Capital Foods for a deal for the last few months, and the number floating around was around $1 billion. But they weren't the only suitors as Capital Foods, one of India’s largest culinary food ingredient maker, also saw interest from Kraft Heinz, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Tata Consumer Products, and ITC.  Also Read: Nestle eyes $1 billion deal for ‘Ching’s Secret’ owner Capital Foods in India  A Nestle India spokesperson did not want to verify the potential deal, stating, “We do not comment on rumours and speculations. We do not comment on market speculation.&quot;  The bids  A source in the know said ITC has put in a bit around the Rs 4,000 crore mark, while Nestle values Capital Foods a bit higher between  Rs 4,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore. The deal is in the final stage and the source says an acquisition is likely to be announced within a month.  Nestle India's portfolio in the country includes products in food, beverages, chocolate, and confectioneries. Its most popular brand is Maggi, which sells seasonings, instant soups, and much-loved noodles. The company has over 60 percent market share of India’s Rs 11,600-crore instant noodles segment.  The deal, if concluded, may be one of the largest buyouts of a homegrown consumer brand in the food space.  Should Nestle clinch the deal, it will give the company an immediate entry into the fast-growing Chinese food ingredient space, where it currently lags.  Ching’s Secret makes chutneys, instant soups, Chinese masalas, Chinese sauces, hakka noodles and flavoured noodles, catering to the demand for so-called ‘Indian Chinese’ food products. Meanwhile, Smith &amp;amp; Jones makes pasta masala, pizza ketchup and cooking pastes.  According to an analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity, Capital Foods likely clocked FY23 revenue of around Rs 840 crore, and at a deal size of Rs 4,000-5,000 crore, it will be valued at 4.5-5 times its earnings. The company currently has a revenue run rate of Rs 1,000 crore, the source added.  Should ITC win the race, it will expand its presence in the consumer goods and ready-to-cook food ingredients space.  ITC’s food offerings include Aashirvaad multi-grain atta, Farmlite range of biscuits, Sunfeast protein shake, and Nutrilite B Natural beverages, among many others.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/nestle-itc-in-last-lap-for-race-for-multi-crore-capital-foods-acquisition-deal-10655701.html,2,2.0

ITC,2023-05-19T20:41:57+05:30,2023-05-19,N Mahalakshmi,MC Long View: ITC on a swing. Will the momentum continue?,"The sentiment around ITC has changed on the back of strong cigarette revenue growth, improving margins and a host of other","It has been the most damned stock for the last few years, but last month the stock hit Rs 400 attracting an unfair share of attention. No other stock in recent memory has been so talked about on crossing a psychological mark, which, by the way, is of little significance to investors. But then, ITC has been a subject of much ridicule as the stock underperformed miserably over the past few years when the rest of consumer companies were going through the roof notwithstanding their already high valuations. ITC was trading at around Rs 340 in July 2017, tanked all the way to 160 in March 2020 (laid low by Covid), and this year it scaled past its 2017 peak to cross Rs 400 levels in April. Currently, trading at Rs 417, the stock commands a market-cap of Rs 5.17 trillion.  What has really changed for the tobacco-to-hotels conglomerate?  If you ask ardent value investors, they’ll tell you that this is simply in the nature of stock markets, that stocks can languish for a long time before they catch the market’s fancy. Perception plays a big role in performance over the short and medium term, but in the end, earnings are the key driver of stock prices and sooner or later, if the earnings story remains intact, the stock price will catch up.  ITC’s underperformance for the longest time and its sudden surge is a blend of both perception and reality. There are at least five factors that have contributed to the turn. And the Q4 numbers announced yesterday only support the change in sentiment. ITC’s Q4 numbers beat analyst expectations on all counts: it reported a 21.4 percent year-on-year growth in standalone net profit at Rs 5,086 crore, much higher than the analyst expectation of Rs 4764 crore, revenue went up 5.6 percent to Rs 16,398 crore, against an expectation of Rs 16,152 crore. Even more, Ebitda margin showed an impressive up move at 37.9 percent, up from 33.6 percent in the year-ago period. Most analysts have re-iterated their ‘buy’ on the stock.    But let’s get back to the larger triggers beyond the recent numbers that are powering the rally in ITC.  First, the growth perception for cigarettes has changed decisively. If you look at the sales volume in cigarettes, it has been quite erratic over the past decade. Till FY20-21, cigarette volumes either showed negative or lower single digit growth (see chart). Obviously, if volumes are so erratic in a segment that is your biggest driver of profits, who is going to touch the stock?  Cigarettes contributed 68 percent to ITC’s revenue in FY13, which had come down to 60% by FY17 and 40% in FY22. It’s contribution to EBIT has also come down from 86 percent in FY17 to 78 percent in FY18. But why was the volume declining? For two main reasons. One, the government was continuously increasing the duty on cigarettes, which was eating into sales. Second, of course, Covid had an impact on sales because lockdowns meant that pan shops were shut, and availability was a problem. All outdoor businesses were affected and so were cigarette sales.  These two domestic factors only cemented the already-negative perception around tobacco companies world over, as smoking rates have been on a continuous decline due to health concerns, tighter regulations, and companies having to perennially fight litigations, especially in the US. Litigations are not a problem in India, but the negative perception has been building.  But over the past two years, ITC’s volumes have been robust. In FY21-22, cigarette volumes were up 17 percent, and in FY23 the volume is estimated to have grown 18 percent. One of the reasons for this volume comeback is that taxes have not increased much. In fact, once GST was introduced and cigarettes were kept out of it, there was a fear that the government would meddle with taxes too much and cigarette volumes would go for a toss again. But that did not happen. Instead, the reverse happened.    The rational taxes helped ITC gain market-share. First, it helped the company take away share from the unorganised segment — some of the beedi smokers now smoke cigarettes. Second, cigarette smuggling has been coming down, helping sales further.  Higher volume has obviously helped the company clock robust growth in profits. Now, will this trend continue?  The thing is that smokers will continue to smoke and pay more for their cigarettes as long as they don’t feel that they are paying double the money for half a puff. A modest price increase below the general inflation level is very much acceptable because smokers are addicted anyway. So modest price increases are okay. Volumes tend to take a hit only if taxes are increased too much.  A lot of market participants now believe that the company has productively engaged with the government to impress upon them that taxes should be kept under check because as long as sales are robust, the government can earn better in terms of tax revenues as well. By hiking taxes on cigarettes, they only end up encouraging beedi sales and cigarette smuggling, neither of which contribute to the tax kitty.  Thus, if tax increases are modest, then cigarette sales should be steady, which lends stability to ITC’s overall growth, although there is no argument about the fact that tobacco is a declining business in the long run.  That’s about cigarette sales.  Second reason for the comeback is the company’s growing profitability in its non-cigarettes FMCG business. In FY17 EBIT margin for this segment was negligible (0.25%) and that has now moved to about 7.19%. It’s still way behind its FMCG peers but there is at least some semblance of profitability emerging here.    Now, the third reason for the stock to be back in favour is the fact that the anti-ESG trade around the world is now fading. In fact, it is as good as over. Over the last few years, if a company was into a business that was environment-unfriendly, like fossil fuels, or in socially undesirable businesses like tobacco, investors would be hesitant to touch them.  Fact is, while as a concept ESG is a noble idea, there was never any altruistic motive behind ESG investing. Here is why: if governments perceive that certain businesses or practices are undesirable, they will levy additional taxes and punish them economically or make life difficult for them in terms of regulations. So, from an investment standpoint ESG essentially means a tax on the future which will hit cash flows and profitability.  But post-Covid supply disruptions have thrown this theory out of the window. The markets do not care about ESG anymore, because markets are greedy, and they will go wherever there is money. Since they saw oil and coal prices go up, they latched on to those stocks once again. Ditto for tobacco. This fading of the ESG narrative has actually helped bring some of the unloved businesses back in favour, and ITC is one such.  Even more, news that some high-profile investors are buying into the stock creates its own momentum. For instance, last quarter’s shareholding pattern showed that Rajiv Jain of GQG Partners, who was in the news recently for buying into Adani stocks, has picked up a stake in ITC. Now, in investing be it individuals or institutions herding is quite common and as the stock gains traction it will attract more institutions.  A fourth reason is that ITC is still seen as a good defensive play. When investors want some kind of defensive positioning in their portfolio when markets look uncertain, where do they go? They load up on a stock like ITC. The fact that it is not over-owned makes it less vulnerable to any kind of drawdown. It is a consumer company where revenue and profit growth look kind of predictable now, especially as the cigarette volume story looks good.  Yet another trigger for the stock could be the de-merger of the hotels business. Hotels is a business with low return ratios and is a drag on overall ROE. The management has said it will de-merge the business, and if it does, the stock could see another round of re-rating. Not counting that, even if the company refrains from deploying incremental capital into the hotels business and takes on management contracts, as it has committed already, and keeps its balance sheet asset-light, the financial complexion will still aid the stock.  Even as the narrative turns overwhelmingly positive for ITC, it continues to be super cheap compared to other consumer companies. A P/E of 28 times trailing versus 55-80 for rivals in the consumer space — the gap is substantial, leaving room for further re-rating.  But despite the recent optimism, ITC cannot be compared to a consumer company. Currently, 37% percent of ITC’s revenue comes from tobacco, but it contributes more than 75% percent to its overall EBIT because it enjoys a margin of 63 percent. Thought the growth pangs seem over for now, it is not perceived as business that has great potential for high growth over a long period, and increasingly regulators will only look to penalise such companies. On the other hand, the rest of the businesses which contribute 63 percent of the revenues have a 11 percent margin and contribute 23 percent to profits.  Of course, as noted earlier the non-cigarette FMCG business is showing growth in profitability, which is a surely a positive. Still, the irony of ITC is that the business which enjoys superlative margins and constitutes the bulk of its profits is perceived to be a shrinking business, while the fast-growing business rivalling Levers and Britannia suffers from inferior margins and return ratios.  Still, ITC is really not a bad bet at 28 times earnings. The stock has already jumped 150 percent since the Covid lows. But be under no illusion: at the end of the day ITC is primarily a tobacco company, because that is what still brings the bulk of its profits. Thus, the valuation gap between ITC and other FMCG companies is unlikely to be bridged fully.  On the flip side, the company pays good dividends — yield is currently around 3 percent, the tobacco growth story is looking good for now, which means the near and medium-term earnings story is on track, and the sentiment has now turned in its favour. Markets have a tendency to overshoot at both ends, so it is unlikely this momentum will fade soon.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mc-long-view-itc-will-the-momentum-continue-10625511.html,0,-0.5

ITC,2023-04-21T18:23:46+05:30,2023-04-21,Andy Mukherjee,ITC: The one Indian conglomerate that’s in no hurry to win,Tobacco giant ITC is transforming itself into a long-term sustainability platform involving hundreds of millions of farmers and consumers. The market is paying attention ,"The erstwhile Imperial Tobacco Co. of India is a powerful creature even in the post-colonial world — except that it has been kept in a cage for too long by diffused, competing interests.  British American Tobacco Plc, the single-largest owner, has always wanted ITC Ltd., as the firm is now known, to focus on cigarettes, and funnel the profit back to its own shareholders. The local management successfully fought to keep the proceeds of addiction at home with the backing of state-run financial institutions, which together control roughly the same stake as BAT’s 29%. As a result of those past battles, ITC is today into everything from hotels and wheat flour to soap, paper and information technology.  Several of those forays have been unimpressive so far, though that is beginning to change. The stock has returned nearly 100% in the past 16 months, the best performer on the benchmark Nifty 50 Index. Meanwhile, other Indian conglomerates have stumbled. The tycoon Gautam Adani’s debt-laden infrastructure empire has soared and crashed, while rival Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. has disappointed investors despite aggressive expansion in everything from retail and telecom to green energy.  By contrast, the unhurried pace of ITC, not controlled by any business family, has been reassuring. Rather than launch a fresh empire-building spree, Sanjiv Puri, who rose through the ranks to become chairman four years ago, has focused on long-term sustainability of the existing portfolio. A year before Covid-19, ITC sold its menswear brand John Players to Ambani’s Reliance Retail, and started shuttering Wills Lifestyle, a premium apparel business that never had a chance against e-commerce. The question now is about other non-tobacco consumer goods in Puri’s stable, such as wheat flour, biscuits, noodles, dairy and beverages. Making food more profitable is ITC’s short-term challenge. The trickier part is to build a low-carbon supply chain around it, connecting tens of millions of farmers with hundreds of millions of consumers.  The country’s eighth-largest publicly traded firm has a market value of $60 billion; it’s sitting on nearly $2 billion of net cash. The 93% of profit ITC returned to investors in the last financial year — after steadying its pandemic-ravaged hospitality division — is a welcome relief from the blistering growth family-run Indian businesses have pursued, without much to show for their efforts.  ITC’s sweet spot won't last forever. Even in a nation of 1.4 billion where one in four adults still uses tobacco, the smoking habit must ultimately fade into the sunset. Right now, it’s a great franchise because ITC controls nearly 80% of the cigarette market. In the nine months through December, the unit’s revenue grew 22%, three times faster than ITC’s own historical average. That’s because of surprisingly stable taxation over the past five years. With illegally imported sticks losing their price advantage over tax-paid cigarettes, profitability has gone through the roof. On an annualized basis, return on depreciated cigarette assets is approaching a staggering 240%, three times the level two decades ago.  A responsible public health approach would require a quid pro quo. The state would ask ITC to start investing in non-combustible products such as heat-not-burn sticks and Swedish snus, helping to counter the sway of bidi — cheap tobacco rolled in coarse leaves — and crushed betel nuts mixed with nicotine, or gutka, an addiction that leads to mouth cancer.  ITC has the technology, but the onus of pushing for harm reduction is on the government. New Delhi’s current policy is the exact opposite: It has imposed a complete ban on e-cigarettes out of a fear that they would become a gateway device for the youth. Those concerns exist everywhere. Even the US Food and Drug Administration has faced criticism for not doing enough to curb flavored nicotine vapors. But in India, traditional products are a far bigger health risk than new technology. The lobby behind chewable tobacco is formidable. Bidi, the poor man’s preferred option for nicotine delivery, is sparsely taxed because it supports 4 million jobs in rural and semi-urban areas.  Cigarettes give ITC unmatched access to general trade, or the network of millions of mom-and-pop stores that reach buyers across the country’s vast geography. Now that commodity-price inflation following Russia’s war in Ukraine is easing, consumer-goods makers are optimistic of a revival, particularly in rural areas where demand slowdown has been both brutal and protracted. ITC can stay around and compete, provided it can lift the unit’s 9% return on assets. With less mature brands, ITC is lagging behind multinationals like Unilever Plc and may soon have to face new competition in general trade from Ambani. Still, staples provide a natural outlet for its other big bet: agriculture.  One way to meet niche consumer demand for gluten-rich grain is to select it from the wheat crop ITC buys. A more efficient alternative is to help farmers’ collectives grow higher-gluten varieties in areas where it makes the most sense. From quick soil-test results on mobile phones to hyperlocal weather forecasts, pest predictions, and crop-monitoring by drones, Puri is building a super-app for farmers with climate at its core. The company is already at the receiving end of extreme weather: After a heat wave damaged last year’s wheat crop, India banned exports, hurting ITC’s revenue. Cutting emissions in the food supply chain and protecting farmers from global warming are business imperatives.  Once the new spice processing factory in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, and the upcoming medicinal nicotine export unit in Mysuru, Karnataka, start paying off, the 24% return on agricultural assets could start to push against the 30% mark. The business is undoubtedly a keeper. So is the paper division. ITC got into cigarette-packaging nearly 100 years ago, and expanded into paperboards in 1979. Puri is now investing in technology that will cut plastic use in smartphone boxes. (Think of it as a paper-pulp egg tray for electronic devices, only sturdier.) After cigarettes, the paper unit already garners the second-highest margins for the conglomerate.  That brings us to hotels. A strong post-pandemic recovery is under way for nearly every player in the Indian hospitality industry. Beyond that, however, an asset-heavy business that has historically struggled to garner even a 5% return doesn’t make sense. ITC's popular restaurant brands will add heft to the cloud-kitchen services it has piloted, while the real estate has its own value. The first 12 hotel buildings anywhere in the world to be certified as net-zero-carbon by the US Green Building Council are ITC properties. Hiving them off into an investment trust might attract interest even from those institutional investors who won’t go anywhere near tobacco companies.  By disallowing new foreign direct investment in tobacco in 2010, India has practically closed the door on a takeover by British American Tobacco. Unless the government has a change of heart, ITC won’t even do a share buyback that could potentially raise BAT’s stake. However, Puri can use the window provided by India’s nationalist tobacco policy to extract the most juice out of the capital he’s allocating to more sustainable businesses — while keeping investors hooked with lavish dividends. With time and money on its side, ITC’s best strategy is to be that Indian conglomerate that’s in no hurry to win.

ITC,2023-04-17T18:15:16+05:30,2023-04-17,Abhishek Mukherjee,"ITC @ 400: A story of patience, payback, and a puff of relief","For many years, there were three paths available to someone looking to develop the virtue of stoicism – buying an under-construction flat in Delhi-NCR, becoming a litigant, or investing in ITC.","Somewhere between despair and dividends, lies ITC.  For many years, there were three paths available to someone looking to develop the virtue of stoicism – buying an under-construction flat in Delhi-NCR, becoming a litigant, or investing in ITC.  While the first two options still retain their charm, those who went for the third are now finally reaping the rewards.  The cigarettes-to-FMCG giant has at long last woken up from its slumber, crossing the psychologically important milestone of Rs 400 on April 17.  Also Read: ITC tops Rs 400, analysts see 10% upside while investors eye Rs 500  It has posted gains of 48 percent over the past year – making it the top performer in the Nifty 50 pack.  Once the proverbial under-achiever, ITC is today clearly marching to the beat of a different drum, comfortably outperforming not just its domestic peers but also its global counterparts on the MSCI ACWI Tobacco Index.    With more and more investors beginning to filter their stock picks through the prism of corporate governance following the Adani Group crisis, ITC has emerged as a clear beneficiary of this “flight to quality”.  Just that this flight has come after an interminable wait on the runway.  Patience  A joke doing the rounds in traders’ WhatsApp groups during 2021 was that the government was contemplating demonetising the Rs 200 banknote and replacing it with the ITC stock.  Like most good quips, it amused some and infuriated the rest – chiefly the ITC shareholders.  Not without reason.  The stock had first touched the Rs 200 mark in early 2013, and like a recalcitrant tenant, refused to budge from that range for the next almost 10 years (barring a few freak sessions in 2017 and 2018 when it crossed Rs 300).  This, even as the rest of the equity universe was churning out one multi-bagger after another in a steady stream of bull-market exuberance.  In a moment dripping with cosmic irony, 2013 was the year when ITC adorned its logo with a new tagline – ‘Enduring Value’. Since then, the investors had largely endured the stock’s underperformance.  The listless show had become a running gag on social media, polarising opinion in a way no stock had done in recent times.  Many ITC shareholders were spending more time doggedly defending the company on Twitter than doing their actual jobs.  Others simply gave up and quietly exited their positions, though retail ownership of the stock continued to remain elevated.  Maybe the ITC stock was more addictive than its cigarettes.  Investors may not have realized it then, but their company was displaying the inexplicable tendency of champions to flounder for an extended period of time despite their best efforts. Think GE, Wal-Mart and Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble in the 1990s. Or Sachin Tendulkar in the early 2000s. Or Aamir Khan currently.  A host of reasons were conjured up in an effort to explain the stock’s sluggishness – outsized reliance on cigarettes, susceptibility to increased taxation on ‘sin goods’, misallocation of capital, the cash-guzzling hospitality business, rising competition in the FMCG space and even the management’s allegedly indifferent attitude towards the capital market community.  The last one was perhaps a tad unfair.  The company leadership had repeatedly highlighted ITC’s strong business performance, a runway for further growth and a debt-free status, though the arguments imploded with painful predictability on Dalal Street.  Addressing shareholders at its AGM in 2021, the company’s chairman Sanjiv Puri said the board was concerned about the share price not appreciating despite its operational performance and over Rs 50,000 crore of dividends payout in the past five years.  Dividends, in fact, were one area where ITC consistently outshined its compatriots.  Some analysts had even labelled ITC a pure dividend play, notwithstanding all the narrative about post-tobacco diversification.  Not to be outdone, a few Twitter prodigies classified the stock as a fixed deposit (and dividends as interest payments) because there was no capital appreciation whatsoever. This set-off yet another round of mockery and memes-fueled savagery online.  The naysayers were once again having all the fun, but it was the investors, who would have the last laugh.  Turnaround  Sometime in 2022, the gods of fate began smiling on ITC.  That, or the seemingly endless stretch of frothy valuations finally forced the algorithms to hunt for alternative avenues of capital deployment in the bluechip space.  Whatever the reason, ITC staged a phoenix-like turnaround, making its long-suffering investors almost airborne with delight.  Suddenly, the horde of detractors vanished in a puff of smoke and the online commentariat pivoted to hearty appreciation.  Analysts had always viewed the company favourably, but even they were taken aback when the stock started to return the affection.  Most brokerages, including JP Morgan, Nomura, Jefferies, Motilal Oswal and ICICI Securities, currently have a ‘buy’ rating on the stock, with target prices in the range of Rs 450-Rs 475.  While analysts and market watchers are tripping over themselves trying to explain the stock’s recent breakout, the fact is that most of these rationales – cigarette volumes growth, robust FMCG sales, margin expansion etc – were true even during the previous years without any corresponding up move in the share price.  True, the post-Covid pent-up demand is providing additional tailwinds to ITC’s businesses but that may hardly be enough to shake off a decade-long lethargy.  Markets may also be salivating at the prospect of the company finally hiving off its hotels and IT verticals – something the management has repeatedly hinted at without giving any concrete timeline.  Purely from a business perspective, investors can expect the good times to continue.  The company accounts for three out of every four cigarettes sold legally in the country, but the legal market itself is just 8 percent of the tobacco consumed in India.  On the FMCG front, it is seeking to straddle two strong and divergent trends driving consumption – premiumisation and downtrading (where consumers shift to lower price packs).  In an interview with CNBC-TV18 in September 2022, Sanjiv Puri said the company has six brands in the Rs 1,000-crore club and intends to scale these further.  The hotel industry is also seeing never-before demand and ITC is looking to capture a slice of the overseas pie as well.  Clearly, the company has considerable leeway for growth.  But as its investors know so well, the correlation between business performance and stock appreciation can be thinner than the delectable rice vermicelli served in ITC Maurya.  This means that while the stock may be having its well-deserved moment in the sun right now, another period of prolonged consolidation cannot be ruled out.  So what should investors do in that case?  Maybe just sit tight, count the dividends, and enjoy the memes on Twitter.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/itc-400-patience-payback-and-a-puff-of-smoke-10427251.html,2,1.6666666666666667
ITC,2023-04-11T13:34:05+05:30,2023-04-11,Shailaja Mohapatra,Why state government budgets are reinforcing Jefferies' conviction on FMCG makers,Concerns abound about the impact of the El Nino weather phenomenon on rural incomes and consumption has turned many fund managers wary of consumer packaged goods makers,"Fast moving consumer good (FMCG) companies confront the risk of below-average monsoon rainfall hurting rural incomes and, consequently their sales, but Jefferies remains overweight on the sector.  Reason: a silver lining in state government budgets that the securities firm says are “exhibiting a populist trend” although overall state expenditure may decline.  An analysis of the budgets of 15 states, which make for 85 percent of India's Gross Domestic Product, shows that spending growth is set to decline from 21 percent in FY23 to 11 percent in FY24.  “But, the bias towards populist spending is visible in the state budgets with a surge in income transfer schemes in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh etc. Big promises have also been made ahead of Karnataka state elections,” Jefferies said in a recent report.  Such announcements can help revive rural consumption and so its conviction on the potential of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies stays firm. Thus, the overweight rating on the FMCG sector.  Also Read: FMCG shows no sign of recovery in rural demand, muted volume growth on cards in Q4  El Nino  To be sure, not all on the Street share the optimism about FMCG companies, who have been battling steep consumer price inflation that prompted many households to tighten their belts and cut spending.  On top of that, concerns abound about the impact of the El Nino weather phenomenon that causes a warming of temperatures in the Pacific and is associated with lower-than-average rainfall in the subcontinent.  Weather forecaster Skymet predicts a “below normal” monsoon in India at 94 percent of the Long Period Average (LPA) rainfall. In the backdrop of the prediction, many fund managers are turning underweight on FMCG stocks.  “Base-level FMCG consumption is stressed. On top of that, valuations are still expensive across the board,” said Mayur Patel, who manages IIFL Focused Equity Fund.  Also Read: Daily Voice | This fund manager is overweight on autos with EV capabilities, and underweight on FMCG  State sops  Jefferies is unfazed.  It cites the fact that Rajasthan has announced a doubling of free units of electricity to 100 units for all households. Maharashtra has announced Rs 6,000 per farmer direct income transfer at an expenditure of Rs 6,700 crore.  Madhya Pradesh is providing Rs 1,000 per month income transfer to women at Rs 8,000 crore annual cost. And, Chhattisgarh will give Rs 2,500 per month to educated unemployed youth and Rs 6,000 per annum to landless laborers, Jefferies noted.  These announcements, it says, can help revive rural consumption, reinforcing its conviction about the potential of FMCG companies. Rural consumption which makes for 45 percent of the sector’s revenue.  In an earlier report dated January 4, Jefferies analysts had noted that government's focus on launching large new social schemes in pre-election years. Be it the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan) scheme in the last election cycle or the national food subsidy scheme prior to that.  “Given the greater presence of the economically weaker sections in rural areas, these schemes tend to benefit the rural economy disproportionately,” the analysts said.  This, coupled with rising activity in the construction sector, the largest employer of unskilled labor, can boost sales volumes in the rural market. Cooling of raw material inflation is also set drive gross margin expansion by 200 basis points and Jefferies expects about 18 percent Earnings Per Share growth for consumer staple companies in FY24, the highest in nearly a decade.

ITC,2023-04-07T19:45:30+05:30,2023-04-07,Shailaja Mohapatra,"FMCG shows no sign of recovery in rural demand, muted volume growth on cards in Q4","Hindustan Unilever, Britannia, ITC and Godrej Consumer Products are set to outperform FMCG peers, analysts say","Another quarter, and the same script for consumer companies. The Street is expecting between 8 and 11 percent revenue growth for packaged consumer goods makers in the quarter ended March 2023 on subdued sales by volume as rural demand continues to lag.  “With no clear signs of recovery in rural demand, sales growth in staples would be led by value growth and premiumization, both of which are also tapering down,” analysts at securities firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services wrote in a note.  Business updates of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies are a clear indication of the trend. Dabur, to whose sales rural India contributes 47 percent, said the segment has “fallen short of a full recovery”.  Marico’s management says a visible and sustained recovery is expected only in the coming quarters.  That said, analysts believe Hindustan Unilever, Britannia, ITC and Godrej Consumer Products are expected to outperform peers.  Hindustan Unilever’s revenue growth at 15 percent is expected to be driven by its laundry segment. HUL said on Friday that n February, its Surf Excel brand had crossed the $1 billion turnover mark.  Britannia’s solid run is set to continue on the back of demand resilience in the biscuits category. For ITC, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities are modelling a 15 percent year-on-year increase in volume growth and 17 percent cigarette growth on an Earnings Before Interest and Taxes basis.  Godrej Consumer Products is expected to report good growth on a low base and its entry into low unit packs of hair color cream and premiumization of air freshners.  Volume growth and margins   Sales volume declines may be behind FMCG companies, but projections for growth are not gung-ho. Most companies are expected to post mid single-digit volume growth in Q4, with Kotak pegging the range at 0-6 percent.  In Q4, consumers in rural India remained cautious before buying staples or a discretionary products as has been the case in previous quarters, analysts said.  To bring back volume growth, advertising and promotional spending has been ramped up by most consumer companies and this, in turn, will affect operating margins.  Companies did not have the liberty to increase ad spending over the past few quarters because high raw material inflation was pinching their gross margins. With palm oil prices and Brent crude prices having dipped in Q4, companies took a step ahead in this direction.  Also Read: MC Opinion | FMCG earnings updates signal healthier margins, but sales growth a mixed bag  There is a huge divergence in EBITDA, or Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization margin growth across companies, Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.  Nine of nineteen stocks under its coverage are likely to report flat or lower EBITDA margins year-on-year. ITC, Asian Paints, Britannia and Nestle are likely to report margin expansion of 180 basis points-250 basis points Year-on-Year (YoY). One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.  Discretionary   Elara Securities’ checks indicate muted demand for paint companies post January and a slowdown in the Business-to-Business (B2B) business vertical.  “Industrial paints, too, are likely to be muted due to flat auto OEM production,” wrote Elara analysts. Asian Paints is expected to report 9 percent YoY sales growth with 6 percent domestic decorative volume growth.  In the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) space, revenue is expected to have declined sequentially since the previous quarter was a festival season. Prices of dairy and flour, two key raw materials for fast food chains, remained elevated in the quarter, which will cause margins to contract  further. Jubilant Foodworks’ Same Store Sales may have contracted 2.5 percent.  Also Read: This fund manager is overweight on autos with EV capabilities, and underweight on FMCG  The one company where analysts are projecting strong double-digit volume growth is Varun Beverages. Kotak Institutional Equities expects 27 percent revenue growth and 20.3 percent volume growth for the company, once again propelled by the energy drink Sting.  In the alcobev segment, United Spirits, Radico Khaitan and United Breweries are seen reporting average growth, but elevated ENA (extra neutral alcohol) prices, which make up 65-70 percent of raw material costs, will adversely affect margins in the quarter. ​  Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Key factors behind its positive outlook are: -Healthy cigarette volume growth in the recent quarters is likely to sustain in the near term, leading to the best three-year and four-year average volume growth for over a decade. With no high indirect tax increase in the FY24 budget, the operating environment is far more conducive compared to the punitive regime of the preceding years. Over the past five to six quarters, the company has sparingly used its pricing lever and can continue to take leverage on the same going forward. Unlike staples peers, the company has displayed resilient operating performance of its ‘Other FMCG’ business in the past few quarters. If wheat costs decline sharply post the Rabi harvest, performance on the segmental margin front can be even better in FY24. Hotels business prospects are likely to be buoyant going forward as highlighted in our thematic report on hotels by our mid-cap team. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock as a result of (a) better earnings visibility over peers in the next few quarters, (b) inexpensive valuations; and (c) attractive dividend yield.  Outlook The challenges for ITC led by (a) an extremely punitive tax regime of the past, (b) covid related disruptions and (c) commodity cost inflation now seems to be receding.

ITC,2023-02-21T16:31:12+05:30,2023-02-21,Shailaja Mohapatra,The 'K' that scares the Great Indian Consumption Story along the course of recovery,"India appears to be in the midst of a K-shaped recovery, with some parts of the economy doing well, while others are struggling. Read on for a sector-by-sector analysis","“People are buying luxury cars but not chappals and underwear.” The joke was everywhere on Twitter recently. But, jokes apart, it shows the grim reality of India’s &quot;K-shaped&quot; recovery.  A K-shaped recovery occurs when different parts of the economy recover at different rates, times, or magnitudes. Though SBI’s economists dismissed the 'K-shaped recovery' critique in a report in January, the Q3 earnings trend flies in the face of that view.  Here’s how India’s consumption story is panning out:  FMCG staples  This segment is a true indicator of a country’s economic health. In India, revenue for the FMCG pack has been on an upward trajectory due to the price hikes to mitigate raw material inflation. But this has come at the cost of volumes.  Rural India constitutes about 36 percent of the sales pie for a typical consumer company and this segment has been reeling under inflationary pressure. So much so, that Nestle India reported a loss in volumes for its Maggi Chotu pack, which costs Rs 7. Except for biscuits, demand in all other FMCG segments has taken a hit.  Also Read: Price hikes hit 'chotu' packs &amp;amp; demand in tier 2-6 towns, rural India resilient: Nestle  While Hindustan Unilever’s Sanjiv Mehta said that he has been seeing “green shoots” in rural demand, there is still a long way to go. According to the report released by data analytics firm NielsenIQ, in October-December, the industry grew 7.6 percent in terms of value but urban volumes grew 1.6 percent year-on-year while rural volumes declined 2.8 percent. Some consumers have down traded to lower unit packs and others to unbranded regional alternatives, analysts noted.  Encouraging winter crop sowing and indications of higher farm income came as good news for the industry but now fears of a subdued monsoon due to El Nino pose a new challenge for the industry.  Consumer discretionary and QSR  “The slowdown in discretionary spends is visible” Not our words. That’s what Uday Kotak said. Be it Asian Paints, Havells or Domino’s operator Jubilant FoodWorks, most discretionary companies have taken a hit on their bottomline as inflation has burned a hole in the low-to-mid income Indian’s pocket.  In Q3, Asian Paints and Pidilite both posted volume growth that was little changed against expectations of 4-5 percent growth. Both flagged demand stress in the rural and semi-urban areas. Electrical consumer goods company Havells reported a 7.2 percent fall in quarterly profit, citing “moderating” consumer demand. Whirlpool India also flagged similar concerns in its earnings statement.  Also Read: Kotak cuts target price for QSR stocks as consumption slows down  Same-store sales growth for quick-service restaurants came in below Street expectations. Analysts believe startup layoffs and the slowdown in IT hiring are impacting spending and sentiment, with the fast-food category also witnessing down trading now. Though the festive season was a good time for the entire discretionary space, the slowdown that has crept in since shows no signs of a turnaround.  Retail  Nykaa’s top boss Falguni Nayar said lower consumer spending impacted the beauty-tech platform’s margin and revenue. It reported a 94 basis points margin contraction in Q3.  Page Industries, which is the exclusive licensee of Jockey, also cautioned that demand is not as buoyant in the ongoing quarter. “We are not seeing any recovery in the market,” managing director VS Ganesh said in a recent earnings call.  Avenue Supermarts’ earnings also disappointed as the higher-margin general merchandise and apparel segments underperformed the FMCG and staples segments. “Discretionary non-FMCG sales did not do as well as expected in this quarter,” said Neville Noronha, CEO &amp;amp; managing director, Avenue Supermarts Limited.  Footwear retailer Relaxo’s Q3 was no different from the industry. Revenue from operations fell 8 percent on-year weighed down by subdued demand in mass segment articles. It also lost market share to unorganised players. On the flip side, luxury shoemakers such as Metro Brands have emerged stronger.    That brings us to the other end of the spectrum.  Hotels and tourism  The hotels and tourism sector is the brightest beacon in the gloomy consumption story. Ever since the pandemic ebbed, the sector has been a major beneficiary of the recovery. In November 2022, the Indian hotel industry recorded its best performance since the pandemic began, with occupancy at 68-70 percent and average rates exceeding Rs 7,000.  The third quarter, which is a seasonally strong quarter thanks to a number of festivals, was strong for hotel companies as they saw sharp jumps in revenue and margins. The management of hotel companies is bullish on the near future as well.  Also Read: Bulls check into Indian Hotels after highest ever quarterly profit  “The outlook is very strong, albeit it is all built mostly on domestic (tourism) because foreign inbound is still lagging behind 2019-20 numbers,” said Puneet Chhatwal, Managing Director &amp;amp; CEO, Indian Hotels, in the chain’s recent analyst call.  He added that there are a lot of events happening this year, “including G20 and the Cricket World Cup, which should further boost demand or provide the necessary buffer should there be any form of headwinds coming from anywhere”.  Analysts concur. In a note, HDFC Securities said that with demand outpacing supply, which the latter is unlikely to catch up with over the next 2-3 years, it expects both average room rates (ARRs) and occupancy to remain strong, leading to higher RevPar for the industry.  Automobiles  Another silver lining in the consumption bucket has been automobiles, especially electric vehicles and sports utility vehicles (SUV). The sector has seen strong growth led by a number of model launches in the mid- to high-end segments.  For some models, such as the Mahindra Scorpio N, Tata Nexon, Maruti Suzuki Brezza and Hyundai Creta, the order backlog is as high as 12 months. The demand is such that the 5-door Jimmy, which Maruti Suzuki launched in January, has already garnered about 17,000 orders, and the count is increasing.  Listen to: Market Minutes | 4 trends set to disrupt the auto sector in coming years  Shares of auto companies have also performed well. BSE Auto, a benchmark index of auto and auto ancillary companies, has returned 17 percent in the last year. Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra and TVS Motor are two of the best performing stocks from the sector, with one-year returns in the 50-70 percent range.   (Graphics: Upnesh Raval, Rajesh Chawla)  One worry has been the poor sales of two-wheelers, which are largely bought by low- and mid-income riders. Motorcycle sales have stagnated, putting pressure on shares of Hero Moto and Bajaj Auto. Eicher Motors has been spared from the selloff as it sells motorcycles in the mid-range, demand for which remains strong.  Sin goods  The so-called sin goods — alcoholic beverages and cigarettes — have also seen strong growth despite challenges. The reason is that they are adapting to inflation, which is hitting the lower economic strata of society.  Some distilleries are banking on premiumisation of their products, targeting mid and high-income consumers, and this portfolio has seen double-digit growth. Cigarette makers, meanwhile, have introduced new sizes that are priced lower and are banking on formalisation of the market.  Hina Nagarajan, MD &amp;amp; CEO of United Spirits, which sells Johnnie Walker branded liquor, said the company continues to witness good growth post-COVID, particularly in the mid-upper segments of the Prestige &amp;amp; Above (P&amp;amp;A) portfolio. That is reflective of the consumption revival in the broader economic context, with the festive season adding further momentum, as mentioned earlier.  Also Read: ITC nears Rs 400 mark; why costlier cigarettes are great news for shareholders  “Our premium Indian whiskeys and scotches continue to drive category expansion on the back of the sustained trend of premiumisation. Inflation and the larger global macroeconomic headwinds may act as a bit of a drag, but we believe that consumer demand will continue to be robust,” said Nagarajan.  Cigarette volumes have also been strong, with double-digit growth recorded across makers. ITC, the biggest cigarette seller, recorded 17 percent growth in revenue from this portfolio.  “Several differentiated variants continue to be launched to further strengthen the range of offerings and ensure future-readiness of the product portfolio,” ITC said in a statement.

ITC,2023-02-02T13:01:01+05:30,2023-02-02,Shailaja Mohapatra,ITC nears Rs 400 mark; why costlier cigarettes are great news for shareholders,The stock took a beating after the Budget hiked the National Calamity Contingent duty but the scrip recovered swiftly when it emerged that the hike was not steep and closed in the green,"There's no stopping diversified conglomerate ITC's bull run. The stock is only 3 percent away from the Rs 400 mark and is trading at an all-time high.  And, that too after taking a beating a day earlier after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget for 2023-24 announced a hike in National Calamity Contingent (NCCD) duty, only to recover swiftly and close in green.  At 12.15 pm on February 2, the stock was quoting at Rs 381.30 apiece on the NSE, up 5.51 percent amid heavy volumes of 34.6 million shares. Earlier in the day, it had hit an all-time high of Rs 384.70 apiece.  Follow our market blog for all the action  Smoke signals  The stock corrected 6 percent as Sitharaman said the NCCD duty on cigarettes was hiked by 16 percent. The reaction was overdone as the Street soon realised that the total tax component on a cigarette stick goes up by only 1-2 percent, said analysts.  The NCCD is a part of the total tax levied on cigarettes. The total tax burden (taxes as a percentage of final tax inclusive retail price) is about 52.7 percent for cigarettes, which includes GST, excise duty as well as NCCD. NCCD is about 10 percent of the overall tax.  The World Health Organization recommends a total tax of 75 percent on tobacco products.  According to Nuvama Institutional Equities, &quot;The tax increase is lower than Street’s/ours expectations, and we expect legal cigarette players to gain share from the illegal ones.&quot; This means higher volumes for ITC.  Cigarette companies will need to raise prices by 2-3 percent, which is not a big ask and can be easily passed on, analysts said.  Analysts at JM Financial believe the move can re-rate the stock further. &quot;We expect ITC to accordingly adopt an approach that could also drive its premiumisation agenda and further increase its relative positioning in the industry,&quot; the brokerage firm said in a report.  It has upped its target multiple on the stock from 23x to 25x price-to-earnings ratio. Nuvama, too, has increased earnings per share (EPS) estimate for FY24 and FY25 by 4 percent each with target price of Rs 450.  After taking a hit during COVID lockdown, cigarette volume growth has been in low double-digits for ITC over the past few quarters.

ITC,2023-02-01T16:55:06+05:30,2023-02-01,Moneycontrol News,"Best budget ever, inclusive, growth-oriented: Here's how India Inc top CEOs rated the Budget","The country's top industrialists give a thumbs up to Budget 2023-24, say it is inclusive, addresses the aspirations of every section, will help India become a global manufacturing hub and is well thought-out","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 presented the last full budget of the Modi government with general elections due in 2024. From raising capex, rejigging tax slabs, giving a boost to the rural sector to education, the Budget tried to pack something for everyone.  Here is what stakeholders and top business leaders have to say about the Budget 2023:  Anil Agarwal, Chairman, Vedanta Ltd  This Budget is one of the best budgets ever, truly inclusive and addresses the aspirations of every section of society. It empowers India’s 1.4 billion people as drivers of the India story. I compliment the PM and FM for the long-term vision that was laid out in the Budget speech as well as the many progressive announcements, like increased outlay for capital expenditure, incentives for the start-ups and MSMEs, green energy, a lower tax for the middle class and boost to tourism which will create massive jobs and reinforce India’s position as the fastest growing major economy in the world.  Bhargav Dasgupta, MD &amp;amp; CEO, ICICI Lombard  The Union Budget FY23-24 is an extremely progressive and inclusive one with a huge focus on infrastructure and capex growth while maintaining the fiscal consolidation path. With fiscal deficit being reduced to 5.9% whilst providing an extremely bullish capex investment of Rs. 10 lac crores (highest ever); will in effect convert revenue expenditure to capital expenditure which has a higher multiplier effect.  It will also mean net borrowing by the government being lower than anticipated at Rs 11.8 lac crores and that augurs well for the bond market and the corporate sector as a whole. Moreover, with tax relief at an individual level would mean an additional Rs 35,000 crores available for consumption. Fuelled by ease of doing business related policies and regulations, this will bolster growth especially in the highly regulated financial services space. For a category like general insurance, these macro economic indicators would provide the much-needed thrust for bridging the penetration gap in the country.  There are some pertinent developments that will enable growth for the industry in the longer horizon. The focus on tourism will pave the way for not just generating employment and investments but also travel insurance in the long term. We have always been zealot about capacity and capability building in health arena and Govt setting up nursing colleges is  a positive development. Infact I believe the CoE on AI being set up could be a game changer with access to right talent pool in India. On the auto front, the old vehicle and ambulance scrapping policy is a step in the right direction. Overall, the budget this year has been growth oriented while also being fiscally responsible which is laudable.  Rakesh Bharti Mittal, Vice Chairman of Bharti Enterprises  Telecom is the highest taxed sector today. The only thing we were asking the government to look into were taxes for our sector. That is something we wish for and will look ahead for in the next year budget. However, it has been an inclusive budget and we are happy with it.&quot;  Sanjeev Puri, MD, ITC  It is a very good, growth-oriented budget. It shows consistency of thought &amp;amp; strategy. Good for business environment. It is inclusive &amp;amp; prudent &amp;amp; touches all sectors of society for development. Public works when combined with growth we are seeing of private capex, though it is nascent right now, it will have a progressive future &amp;amp; good multiplier effect on the economy &amp;amp; make our economy more competitive.  Bimlendra Jha, Managing Director, Jindal Steel &amp;amp; Power   As expected, the government continues to put focus on infrastructure and construction with a budgetary allocation of Rs 10 lakh crores for the sector. This augurs well for Steel and Cement. These industries will also gain from the focus on rail and transport infrastructure projects as well as budgetary allocation to improve urban infrastructure in tier 2 &amp;amp; tier 3 cities.  Follow: Budget 2023 Key Highlights LIVE: From new income tax slabs, costlier cigarettes to PAN Card, everything you need to know  Sumant Sinha, Chairman and CEO, ReNew Power  The focus of the budget on expanded support for infrastructure investment, growth of small industry and agriculture sectors, while committing to fiscal consolidation, strikes the right balance. In the context of overall geopolitical and economic outlook, the outlay of Rs 35,000 crore for energy transition and energy security is a significant step forward. We believe the Finance Minister has presented a Green Budget that demonstrates the Government of India’s unwavering commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2070.  For the clean energy sector, there are several welcome announcements. Support for Battery Energy Storage Systems (requested by ReNew Power during pre-budget consultations), the transmission infrastructure to evacuate power from Ladakh, the allocation for biogas to energy projects and the initiatives for scrapping of old vehicles of the central and state governments are all significant steps in the right direction. We look forward to seeing further details on the recently announced Rs 19,500 crores allocation for the National Green Hydrogen Mission.  The budget will give a thrust to accelerating clean energy in India and ReNew Power is committed to support the Government of India in this endeavour.  Kamal Bali, MD &amp;amp; President of Volvo Group in India  The budget is commendable for being extremely well thought out - it is growth-oriented, bold, inclusive and responsible, upping the ante on infra creation, connectivity and logistics efficiency as well as on green &amp;amp; digital future. Clearly, the budget has brought in the entire value chain especially the youth, MSMEs and the Agri sector, while being fiscally prudent. I am sure the private sector will respond very pragmatically to this outstanding budget.  Ritesh Agarwal, Oyo founder and CEO  We welcome the move to develop 50 cities across India as a complete package for domestic and international tourism and developing an app to ensure all the key metrics related to travel and tourism for the said cities are regularly updated.  We also laud the move to incentivise states to set up ‘Unity Malls’ in their most popular tourism destination for the promotion of GI, ‘Made in India’ products and handicrafts. Integrated development of theme-based tourism circuit under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme, with special focus on improving infrastructure and amenities in border villages will provide a much-needed boost to rural and agriculture tourism. This will empower the farmers in building and setting up homestays that provide an additional source of income for them while also providing an authentic Indian experience to the travellers.  Dilip Oommen, President of Indian Steel ssociation, &amp;amp; CEO of AM/NS India and Executive Vice President of ArcelorMittal   A progressive ‘Saptarshi’ Budget – the first in Amrit Kaal – has hit the right notes to fuel growth across industries and propel India to become a global manufacturing hub.  A significant 33% increase in capital expenditure to Rs 10 lakh crore – 3.3 % of the GDP, thrust to fast-track infrastructure development, and the highest ever Rs 2.40 lakh crore for railways will translate into robust domestic steel demand, thus spurring private investments and job creations.  First and last-mile connectivity for sectors like steel, ports, coal, etc. with an investment of Rs 75,000 crore will improve logistics efficiency. This Budget is focused on growth and improving consumption. At the same time, there is a focus on the green economy and digitalisation. Reforms are on the right trajectory of fiscal consolidation to reach the targeted fiscal deficit level below 4.5% by 2025-26.  The Budget underpins a long-term plan that shows the right path to drive economic revival at a time when advanced economies are facing a tough time.  Rajesh Gopinathan, MD &amp;amp; CEO, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)  The Union Budget 2023 by the Honourable Finance Minister further builds on the government’s focus on enhancing India's digital infrastructure and enabling growth pathways for the Indian economy. The provisions for research in artificial intelligence and 5G implementation, and the Government's vision of Make AI in India and Make AI work for India are commendable. Bringing in the National Data Governance policy is also a welcome step. Overall, it's a forward-looking budget that will fortify the digital spine of the country.  Prashant Kumar, MD &amp;amp; CEO, YES BANK  The Union Budget 2023 attempts an inclusive growth structure for the economy through various measures that are expected to reach the last mile. The effective capex of the Central government was enhanced to INR 13.7 Lakh crores, or 4.5% of the GDP was an acknowledgment that capital expenditures are crucial for the economy and could boost the growth.  As the efficiency of capital expenditures is higher at the state level, the government once again earmarked INR 1.3 lakh crores as a 50-year loan to States, which would incentivize capital expenditure. ECLGS scheme continues with an additional INR 9000 crore added to the corpus which would boost the fund flow for the MSME sector.  Angshu Mallick, MD &amp;amp; CEO, Adani Wilmar Ltd.  We congratulate the central government for guiding the country to become the 5th largest economy in the world. The Union Budget 2023 reflects upon the government's plan to stimulate India's economy with a well-planned policy and regulation-based framework. We believe, the various schemes and policies will play a critical role in laying the foundation for accelerated digitalization and enabling Indian businesses to become prominent players on the global stage.  As one of the leading players in the FMCG sector, we are optimistic about a strong uptick in rural demand on the back of ,massive wave of digitisation through an array of infrastructure-led initiatives announced by the Government, thereby empowering the farmers and the agricultural sector. Furthermore, decentralisation in storage facilities will provide further assistance to ensure India’s surplus food produce is not wasted. The total CAPEX outlay in the Union Budget has been enhanced by 33% from 7.5 Lakh Cr to 10.0 Lakh Cr which takes it to an all-time high of 3% of GDP, this positive outlook will surely stimulate consumption, generate opportunities both in rural and urban employment and jack up local production.  Overall, the Union Budget 2023 lays a strong foundation for India@100 with enhanced focus on farming sector, which is the backbone of Indian economy as well as digitisation that will open new growth opportunities for the economy.  Rajesh Magow, Co-Founder and Group CEO of MakeMyTrip  It is noteworthy that the Honorable FM has highlighted tourism as a focus area. The union budget entails multiple welcome initiatives like the revival of 50 airports, the building of 50 new destinations, and high budgetary outlays on railways, roads, and highways, which will help long-term growth for the domestic travel and tourism industry.  However, one budget proposal that will negatively impact the industry is the move to increase the TCS mandate from 5% to 20% on overseas tour packages. This will not only increase the upfront cash outflow for customers but will also give an unfair advantage to foreign-based online travel booking platforms over India-based travel agents and tour operators.  Abhay Bhutada, MD, Poonawalla Fincorp  The 2023-2024 Union Budget presented by FM Nirmala Sitharaman showcases the government's commitment to putting people first and uplifting the nation's financial status. With a focus on 'janbhagidari' through 'sabka saath, sabka prayaas' and seven pillars, including green growth, youthpower, and infrastructure investment, this budget sets the foundation for a technology-driven and knowledge-based economy. The new tax slabs, with a reduced maximum marginal rate of 39% and an income rebate limit of Rs 7 lakh, empowers the middle class with more spending power, thereby elevating the country's economy.  The government's continued support and commitment to the MSME sector are commendable, as it is crucial in driving the nation's economic growth. The improved credit guarantee scheme, along with reducing compliances will significantly help alleviate stress in the MSME sector.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/budget-2023-heres-what-top-industrialists-have-to-say-9982001.html,0,0.3333333333333333

The company will be putting together strengths of its agriculture, food and hospitality business verticals to promote millets with plans to introduce products with the cereal in most of its categories. Due to climate change, long period of extreme weather events raise a big issue of food and nutritional security despite all the steps taken up for decarbonisation and its mitigation, ITC Ltd Chairman and Managing Director Sanjiv Puri said addressing a virtual press conference. &quot;I think it (millets) can certainly play a significant role in addressing this issue because millet is nutritious, planet-friendly and resilient. Millet uses 70 per cent less water than rice. It has 40 per cent less use of energy as compared to wheat in processing. It grows in half the time as wheat grows,&quot; he asserted. With the UN declaring 2023 as the International Year of Millets, guided by the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Puri said ITC has also &quot;decided that we will bring all our enterprise strengths together and we will collectively put our shoulder to it and give a big push in this area.&quot; &quot;In most of our categories, we will find variants with inclusion of millets. We will also find, where feasible, products made out of 100 per cent millets. We will also find things like multi millet mix that gives the opportunity for consumers to add a little bit to whatever they are preparing and start going through the journey of welding that kind of taste...,&quot; he added. ITC has already introduced a number of millet-based products under the Aashirvaad Nature Superfoods brand, including ragi flour, gluten free atta, multi-millet mix. It is further developing a comprehensive millets-based portfolio under popular brand names and in familiar formats to enable easier adoption.

Puri said under ITC Mission Millet, the company's agri, foods and hospitality businesses will work on initiatives to build awareness on millets focused on educating consumers, empowering farmers. The company will seek to encourage trials through various millet-based range of products and formats to help build the taste; make millets more palatable and tastier by sharing healthy recipes, tips and hacks.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/itc-announces-initiative-to-promote-millets-in-food-9938381.html,0,0.0
ITC,2023-01-18T13:26:21+05:30,2023-01-18,Moneycontrol News,ITC stock price rises on news of buying out health food maker Sproutlife,The cigarette maker said it plans to acquire 100 percent of Sproutlife in multiple tranches.,"ITC, the breakout stock of last year, saw some buying on January 18 after the company announced acquisition of Sproutlife Foods Private Limited, the makers of Yoga Bar, a health food.  The cigarettes-to-hotel conglomerate said it plans to acquire 100 percent of Sproutlife in multiple tranches. It will pick up 47.5 percent in the company in two tranches for investments of Rs 175 crore and Rs 80 crore by 2025.  The price for the rest of the stake is yet to be fixed. It will be determined based on pre-agreed valuation criteria, within three months from the date on which Sproutlife provides the audited financial statements for the financial year ending on March 31, 2026.  Suhasini Sampath, co-founder of Sproutlife, said the company deals in products offering high gross margins. Its gross margin is in the range of 40-50 percent, he said.  ITC has been criticised time and again for comparatively lower margins for its FMCG portfolio. The addition of a high-margin product to its portfolio will definitely be a help.  Sampath said he was excited about having access to ITC’s strong distribution network. “ITC will help us in improving logistics,” he told CNBC-TV18.  In the fiscal year 2022, Sproutlife made a sale of Rs 68 crore - up from Rs 32 crore and Rs 39 crore in the previous two years respectively. Sampath estimated that Yoga Bar sales will cross Rs 100 crore in FY23.  The stock hit a high of Rs 336.50 on January 18, up over 1 percent from previous close. However, it saw some profit-booking at high levels but still traded up 0.6 percent at Rs 334.  In the F&amp;amp;O market, open interest for ITC reached the week’s high level, climbing 4 percent on January 18. Rising price and open interest means a bullish setup is emerging in a stock.  Analysts have a positive view on ITC. Bloomberg data shows 33 analysts have a ‘buy’ call on the stock with two assigning ‘hold’ ratings. The stock has failed to leave a mark so far this year and is flat. Its one year performance is still impressive at 51 percent.

ITC,2023-01-10T11:19:13+05:30,2023-01-10,Shailaja Mohapatra,Q3 preview | FMCG margins set to expand but slow recovery in rural demand to play spoilsport,"Most of the revenue growth will be driven by price hikes, while food will outperform personal care. Discretionary companies  such as paints, jewellery, apparel and QSR face a demand slowdown, say analysts","Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are likely to see an improvement in their margins sequentially in the October-December quarter due to the liquidation of high-cost inventory and a fall in raw material prices. Revenue growth, however, is expected to be slower due to inflation affecting demand, mainly in rural areas, say analysts.  For the 19 consumer companies under its coverage, Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects 9.3 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in topline, 9.6 percent in Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) and 8.1 percent in net profit.  The majority of the revenue growth will be driven via price hikes, which companies took in the past quarters to combat raw material inflation.  “With no clear signs of recovery in rural demand, we expect sales in staples to be driven by price increases and some premiumisation,” Motilal Oswal said.  Also Read: Budget 2023 | With inflation fears subsiding, the FMCG sector wishes for more money in the hands of consumers  According to analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE), Nestle and Britannia will lead the staples pack with revenue growth of 19 percent YoY and 16 percent YoY. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is expected to post 14 percent YoY revenue growth.  “Foods will outperform personal care. Biscuits and noodles are expected to see robust momentum due to downtrading from street food,” stated Nuvama Institutional Equities.  Rural demand still sluggish  Rural demand did not improve at all in Q3, note analysts. Dabur India in its Q3 business update highlighted that the pressure on rural demand was further aggravated by the late onset of winter in north India.  Marico’s Q3 business update was also downbeat. The Parachute oilmaker said its consolidated revenue will grow in the low single-digit on a YoY basis due to a muted recovery in rural demand amid elevated inflation.  “General inflation and rainfall deficit in populous states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal and Jharkhand remain the key challenges, which have affected rural disposable income,” according to analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities.  Margins and volume growth  The good news for FMCG companies is set to come on the margin front. Gross and operating margins will see sequential improvement as raw material prices have cooled off significantly from their peak and high-cost inventory has been liquidated. However, analysts believe that increased ad spends can keep margin improvement in check.  “The major benefits of benign raw material prices will be witnessed in Q4FY23 onwards,” as per a note from Philip Capital.  Also Read: After a year of struggle for consumer staples, 2023 looks promising for FMCG  Meanwhile, volume growth is expected to be subdued. Kotak analysts expect 4 percent underlying volume growth from HUL, 4 percent from Britannia and 2 percent from Godrej Consumer. In October, HUL cuts soaps prices across India due to a fall in palm oil prices, and as a result, volume trajectory is likely to improve in soaps, believe experts.  Discretionary demand dwindles  The picture looks grim for discretionary companies as the industry saw a demand slowdown in Q3 across paints, jewellery, apparel and QSR (quick service restaurants).  “Paint volumes remained muted in October due to a high base and rains, which affected festive demand, but November and December marked good recovery,” notes Nuvama Institutional Equities.  KIE estimates Asian Paints and Kansai Nerolac’s revenue to decline YoY by 1 percent and 5 percent respectively. Berger Paints and Indigo Paints may clock 7 percent and 8 percent revenue growth, respectively.

Westlife Development’s average daily sales are expected to be resilient, partly aided by a 2 percent price hike taken in October while Varun Beverages is set to outperform on the back of market share gains in under-penetrated areas with its energy drink Sting.

ITC,2022-12-28T09:30:53+05:30,2022-12-28,Shailaja Mohapatra,"HDFC, Adani Enterprises and other memed stocks of the year","Though many stocks made headlines this year, the ones that left a mark were those that were picked up by the meme community. Reddit, Twitter, and WhatsApp were all flooded by them and investors had a good laugh in a year marred by market volatility","India Pakistan T20 World Cup match, Argentina versus France in FIFA’s final showdown and Indian equity markets in 2022 ― all three had something in common ― they set hearts racing with nail biting twists and turns. If you look at the Nifty’s move this year, from 17,600 to 15,300 to 18,800 and back to 17,900 ― investors bled money, made money and again lost some before closing the year. It was nothing short of a roller-coaster ride.  Many stocks made headlines but the ones that really left a mark were those that were picked up by the meme community. Be it a stunning rally or a disappointing decline, memes made some stocks eternal this year. Reddit, Twitter, and WhatsApp were all flooded by them and investors had a good laugh in a year marred by market volatility. Let’s take a look at some.  HDFC twins  On April 4, before the market opened, an announcement took everyone by surprise. A transformational merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank sent newsrooms into a scurry. It was not anticipated. There were hardly any whispers on such a deal brewing. “I am disappointed with media intelligence,” said Deepak Parekh as he addressed reporters in a press conference.  Nevertheless, the announcement gave enough fodder to memers who unleashed their creativity. As the merger is all set to create a $160-billion financial services behemoth, investors were quick to liken it to Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s popular dialogue from Gangs of Wasseypur – Kabhi kabhi lagta hai apun hi bhagwan hai.    Adani Enterprises  Akshay Kumar sported an eccentric polka dot shirt in Hera Pheri and claimed he can double your money in 25 days. That was a lie, but Adani Enterprises has certainly managed to do so in the span of one year. The stock began its 2022 climb at Rs 1,700 and is all set to end above Rs 3,700. A big trigger was its entry into the Nifty 50 index in September.  The flagship entity of Adani Group and its Chairperson Gautam Adani were in the limelight for many other reasons, as well. A cement deal which makes it the second-largest player in the space, a media deal which made heads turn, a blockbuster debut by the group’s FMCG arm, and a relentless rally that has propelled its promoter to Asia’s richest man ― it was certainly an eventful year for Adani Enterprises. Not to forget, a mind boggling 345x P/E valuation has also left many investors scratching their heads.    LIC  The public insurer’s listing on May 17 was the event of a lifetime. The government’s 3.5 percent stake sale in the 65-year-old institution made it India’s biggest ever initial public offering (IPO). It fetched close to Rs 21,000 crore. The issue price was set at Rs 949 apiece. Retail investors lapped up the shares, with their allotted quota subscribed 1.99 times. It was the perfect recipe for a grand success, but then… the dreadful happened!  The stock listed 8 percent below its issue price at Rs 872. Fingers were pointed at the Reserve Bank of India. Investors said RBI’s sudden interest rate hike soured the mood and caused the listing to be at a discount. For the meme world, LIC was Baahubali, RBI was Katappa.  Since its listing, the stock has gone only downwards. It is set to end the year near Rs 690 level.    ITC  No list is complete without the OG meme stock – ITC. Since May 2019, investors had been waiting patiently to see the stock touch the Rs 300 mark again. And it finally happened in July 2022. Just like its many businesses ― cigarettes, FMCG, hotels, paper, agri ― the variety of memes was a sight to behold. From a turtle on a treadmill to a galloping bull, ITC was likened to several animals.  It is the second-best-performing Nifty stock of the year, with a 52 percent gain. If we go by what brokerages say, the stock is all set to puff more gains in 2023. For instance, Antique Stock Broking has a Rs 419 target on the stock. One can only imagine the hysteria that will follow once ITC crosses the Rs 400 mark!  #itc touched Rs.300/- ITC stock to ITC investors: pic.twitter.com/w6N7QGcLGu  — Ahmad Sadat Nawfal (@sadat_nawfal) July 21, 2022   Zomato  Zomato’s lock-in period ended on July 25 and the stock crashed to a record low, triggering a meme fest on social media. The most iconic meme was one comparing Zomato’s share price to the price of one kg of tomato. Currently, it is trading way below its issue price of Rs 76.  Zomato sure has an edge as it operates in a duopolistic market, believe analysts. But, its $570-million acquisition of Blinkit resulting in greater cash burn has not gone down well with investors. The company still has some way to go before it can dish out profits. Till then, social media will serve you some great memes. Keep watching the space!    Do share your favourite stock memes of the year with us! And here’s to hoping that 2023 has another laugh riot in store for us.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/rewind-2022-hdfc-lic-adani-enterprises-itc-zomato-paytm-nykaa-and-other-meme-stocks-of-the-year-9772941.html,2,2.0
ITC,2022-12-13T19:29:27+05:30,2022-12-13,Shailaja Mohapatra,MC Interview | This fund manager believes ITC should be trading at Rs 200,"There are only two people who know the Nifty target. One is God. The other is a liar. No one knows where the markets will go, Manu Rishi Guptha said","Hotelier-turned-fund manager Manu Rishi Guptha first dabbled in the stock market in 1993. His goal: More pocket money. Guptha was in college then. “I realised the kind of money that can be made from the stock market after I saw a picture of Harshad Mehta with his lavish car collection. He was the highest tax-payer at the time,” Guptha said in an interview with Moneycontrol.  With two of his friends, he launched a small fund in college, pooling in money from classmates, teachers and family members. In 2.5 years, the fund managed to double everyone’s investments, he claims. Unilever, Pooja Granites, Sunku Auto, and Citicorp Securities were some of the stocks they invested in.  ALSO READ: Staples, cement good medium-term bets; financials, industrials for long term: Amish Shah, BofA  After 25 years in the hospitality industry, Guptha is back in the portfolio management service industry. His fund MRG Capital, incepted in 2019, has a little under Rs 100 crore in assets under management (AUM) and the top holdings include Infosys, ICICI Securities and Tata Chemicals. Edited excerpts from the interview:  What is your current market outlook? Do you believe the Indian markets are overvalued?  Our markets are about two standard deviations above the long-term average. Look from a macro-economic perspective. There's a war raging on with uncertainty in oil prices, there’s churn in fiat currencies, and volatility in the dollar index. In the US, the yield curve has not been as inverted in the last 40 years as it is now. There are a lot of unknown variables in the global stock markets and a bad news might come any time soon.  So, are you sitting on cash right now?  Yes. Overall, we are sitting on 10-15 percent cash. But in some accounts, we are almost 80 percent in cash. These are clients who joined us in the last six months.  You don’t believe India has decoupled from the global markets, do you?  If India has truly decoupled, then why are we discussing US interest rates and Fed commentary every other day. So no, it has not decoupled. But, I believe, it can happen in the next 10 years. India’s young demographic and economic prospects give us 20-25 years of growth runway.  However, a robust equity market can only be sustained when there’s ease of doing business. And for that, contract enforcement is key. People need to be held accountable if contracts are not being honoured.  Last year, ITC had slapped a defamation lawsuit against you. It is the best-performing Nifty stock this year. Do you hold the stock in your portfolio?  I still hold a large chunk of ITC in my personal capacity. That allows me the opportunity to voice my concerns as a shareholder. However, MRG Capital has negligible quantity of ITC shares as a percentage of total assets.  What are these concerns (against ITC)?  I believe it's a great company. But the company’s long-term strategy and capital allocation policies leave much to be desired. As a shareholder, I hope that my logic and data-backed opinions help them put their house in order.  Their cigarettes business is a cash-generating machine. But most of this cash is being used in the FMCG and hotels businesses, where EBITDA margins are in single digits. Meanwhile, ITC's FMCG peers Britannia, HUL, and Nestle are operating at 20+ percent EBITDA margins. Similarly, IHCL, and Lemon Tree have ~40+ percent EBITDA margins.  ITC should stick to its core business and not destroy any more capital. I believe, the stock is overvalued right now.  What is the stock’s fair value at this point in time, in your view?  With its present EBITDA profile, the stock should trade at ~Rs 200 levels.  Why then do you still hold ITC ?  If the house is put in order, with serious changes being implemented in the near future and the elusive demerger of various subsidiaries done, the stock could go up to Rs 1,000 in four or five years.  Also Check Out: MC Podcast | Positive on hospitality sector, but hotel stocks may be overvalued for now: Manu Rishi Guptha  Let’s talk about Infosys, the stock which has the highest weightage in your fund…  Infosys is still managed and very peripherally overseen by the founders. They still love their company. The company generates copious amounts of cash and gives out copious amounts of dividend. What more could a shareholder want?  After the 2017 Vishal Sikka crisis, I think, the stock plunged to Rs 700 apiece. Analysts said ‘Sell Infosys’. Instead I took a loan, leveraged myself and invested 30-40 percent of my wealth in the stock. Following that, there was a 1:1 bonus issue. Essentially, the stock has risen from Rs 350 apiece to Rs 1,600 in less than five years. Not bad, no?  Do you believe Infosys should be commanding a premium over TCS?  Of course, and there's a logic behind it. Since the last four or five quarters, Infosys’ profit margins are better, operational leverage is better, and cash pay-out to shareholders is better than TCS. There’s no reason why TCS should have a 4-5 percentage edge over Infosys, when it comes to P/E valuation.  A large part of Infosys’ revenue comes from its banking solutions software -- Finacle. Almost all banks in India and many banks world-over use it. Changing a vendor, in this case, becomes difficult. So, that’s where the stickiness of revenue comes from.  So, I don't see any existential threat in Infosys. But the second-best choice or an equally good choice would be TCS.  Also Read: India is fortunate to have large amount of population scale systems generating data: Nandan Nilekani  Tata Chemicals has the fourth-largest weightage in your fund. Of all the Tata companies, why this?  After TCS, Tata Chemicals has the healthiest balance sheet in the Tata group. The debt on Tata Steel and Tata Motors’ books will never allow me to buy those stocks.  Tata Chemicals is one of the biggest soda ash manufacturers. Soda ash is used in the making of soaps, glass and cement. Plus, they are expanding their capacity, and Tatas’ corporate governance is unmatched. It is a no-brainer stock, trading at 11 P/E. You can’t go wrong with that.  As a fund, we invested a large part when the stock was at Rs 350-400 level. Now, the stock is above Rs 1,000. Sometimes, you just need a boringly amazing company to keep doing what it does best.  So, at this point in time, do you still think Tata Chemicals is undervalued?  Well, it is reasonably valued. As and when soda ash prices spike, the company will clean up its balance sheet. I feel Tata Chemicals will be a Rs 3,000-stock in the next five years.  ICICI Securities is another heavyweight in your portfolio. What is the rationale for that?  Our fund has the biggest exposure in Infosys, ICICI Securities and Tata Chemicals. We keep juggling these three in our top holdings.  Coming back to ICICI Securities, there is no counterparty risk in the broking, investment banking and advisory business model.  Second, only 3-4 percent of the total population of India is invested in the stock market. In the US, 52 percent of the population is invested in the stock market in some form or the other. The potential to grow is immense. ICICI Securities is truly reliable for online initiation of first-timers in the stock market.  The company is into investment banking, it is underwriting IPOs, and it has a wide product portfolio. I believe, it has the potential to become the Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan of India. In other broking platforms, I see practices being followed that are not in regulatory compliance.  What about Zerodha?  If it was listed, it would have definitely been a part of my portfolio, because they too don't have a counterparty risk. They are purely into brokerage and lending. And, they have really grown very well.  Finally, do you have a Nifty target?  There are only two people who know the Nifty target. One is God. The other is a liar. No one knows where the markets will go.  Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

ITC,2022-12-08T14:00:35+05:30,2022-12-08,PTI," Inflation for FMCG segment cooling down, volume from rural markets going to improve, says ITC CMD Sanjiv...","Presently there is a &quot;phenomenal&quot; amount of inflation, hence FMCG volume growth in rural areas is &quot;muted&quot; and the bulk of the growth is inflation lead, he said in a panel discussion at an event organised by industry body CII.","Inflationary pressure on the FMCG segment is &quot;cooling off a little&quot; and volume growth from the rural markets is going to be better, ITC Chairman &amp;amp; Managing Director Sanjiv Puri said on Thursday.  Presently there is a &quot;phenomenal&quot; amount of inflation, hence FMCG volume growth in rural areas is &quot;muted&quot; and the bulk of the growth is inflation lead, he said in a panel discussion at an event organised by industry body CII.  When asked about the consumption trends, Puri said, &quot;In the FMCG segments, we are seeing both the trends of premiumization and at the same time there is a lot of value-seeking behaviour and stress at the lower price points.&quot; However, he also said that presently India is &quot;much better&quot; than the rest of the world, witnessing high inflation.  &quot;As far as consumption is concerned, the main stress point is inflation induced because prices of lots of products have gone up at a percentage probably in the prior period that would have taken five years to go up,&quot; Puri added.  However, Puri also added that rural demand is going to get better because realisations have been better and costs are up and as a net, it is &quot;better off&quot;.  &quot;There would be certain regions that are going to be more impacted and it is more to do with the distribution of rainfalls and the impact of the untimely rains. Certain areas would be under stress,&quot; he said adding &quot;Overall my assessment is that it is going to be better at time.&quot; Puri also added that Inflation as far as FMCG is concerned is cooling off a little.  Besides, he also added that the macros for investment are &quot;pretty good&quot;.  &quot;If you look at the availability of funds, the corporate income,  better balance sheets, all these are positive. Earnings also are on a better trajectory. The issue that really comes to is about capacity utilisation, which is also picking up. But there is a serious amount of global uncertainty,&quot; he said.  There are also serious headwinds on exports and that is going to dampen sentiments, Puri added.  &quot;For companies like ours, which are domestically focused, private CAPEX is continuing. We have already done and some more is in the pipeline,&quot; he said.  Puri also added that a lot of policy interventions such as Gati Shakti and investment in infrastructure have been done by the government and many of them are &quot;absolutely in the right direction&quot;.  These &quot;will certainly help us benefit from the opportunity that arises,&quot; he said adding though manufacturing is important, India has also to play to some other areas of strength since the demographics are a big strength for the country.  There is also a need to improve the income level and the country should look into sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and food processing, which could be &quot;economic multipliers&quot;, he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy-2/inflation-for-fmcg-segment-cooling-down-volume-from-rural-markets-going-to-improve-says-itc-cmd-sanjiv-puri-9670871.html,0,0.0

Sequentially, the profit rose 7.1 percent from Rs 4,169 crore recorded in June quarter this year.  Standalone revenue (excluding excise duty) came in higher at Rs 16,130 crore for the quarter, an increase of 26.6 percent over Rs 12,731 crore same time last year. Sequentially, the revenue is marginally lower by 6.7 percent from Rs 17,289 crore.  The company's Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation, or EBITDA jumped 27 percent YoY to Rs 5,863.7 crore from Rs 4,615 crore.  EBITDA margin improved marginally to 36.4 percent as against 36.3 percent YoY. This was much higher to what analysts had estimated at 34.3 percent.  Cigarettes  Segment revenue grew 23.3 percent YoY to Rs 6,954 crore. &quot;Stability in taxes, backed by deterrent actions by enforcement agencies, enable continued volume recovery from illicit trade,&quot; said the company.  The segment's recent launches continue to gain traction, with robust growth across regions and markets, it added. Sources told CNBC-TV18 that cigarette volume growth might be as high as 20 percent.  FMCG  Segment revenue jumped 21 percent YoY to Rs 4,885 crore. FMCG EBITDA margin improved 170 basis points sequentially at 9.5 percent.  Sharp escalation in input costs were mitigated through strategic cost management, premiumisation, supply chain agility and judicious pricing actions, informed the company.

Average Room Rates (ARR) and occupancy levels are now ahead of pre-pandemic levels, ITC said in an exchange filing.  The company has a healthy pipeline of properties under Welcomhotel, Mementos, Storii and Fortune, with phased openings planned over the next few quarters.  Paperboards, Paper &amp;amp; Packaging  Segment revenue jumped 25 percent YoY to Rs 2,288 crore. This was on the back of strong demand across end-user segments and exports.  The company continues to scale up its sustainable products portfolio. Margin expansion to 27.5 percent was led by integrated business model, strategic investments and proactive capacity augmentation, said ITC.  Agri-Business  Segment revenue grew 44 percent YoY to Rs 3,997 crore driven by wheat, rice and leaf tobacco exports.

The direct-to-consumer (D2C) brand on Wednesday said it is in advanced discussions with investors for securing Rs 90-100 crore in Series B funding, with ITC infusing Rs 13.5 crore in this.  ITC in a late-night regulatory filing on Tuesday said that after the deal, its shareholding in Mother Sparsh will go up from the existing 16 per cent to 22 per cent.  &quot;The Company has entered into an agreement to acquire further 1,000 Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares of Rs 10 each of Mother Sparsh. The said shares, once acquired, will take the Company's shareholding in Mother Sparsh to 22 per cent,&quot; the filing said.  The acquisition is in line with the company's continued interest in the fast-growing D2C space in the personal care category, ITC added. In November last year, Mother Sparsh raised Series A funding from ITC.  Mother Sparsh, incorporated in February 2016, registered a turnover of Rs 33.53 crore in FY22. After Series B funding, the D2C brand intends to enhance its portfolio, especially across baby skin care and mother-oriented segment. It had recently forayed into the diaper segment.  &quot;Mother Sparsh's objective behind the Series B funding round is to enhance R&amp;amp;D and foster innovation in the critical baby &amp;amp; mom care segment alongside sustained product portfolio diversification,&quot; it said.

ITC,2022-09-30T18:55:16+05:30,2022-09-30,Shubham Raj,"Analyst tracker: Bank, financials remain apple of analysts' eyes; pessimism lingers around IT stocks","Data available with Bloomberg showed that most of the analyst optimism – measured as the percentage of analysts that have a ‘buy’ call on a stock – was centered around ICICI Bank, Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T), and ITC among others.  ","Analyst optimism lingered mostly around banks and financials as of September-end as credit growth peaked at as high as 16 percent and the condition of the Indian economy improved post-pandemic.  Data available with Bloomberg showed that most of the analyst optimism – measured as the percentage of analysts that have a ‘buy’ call on a stock – was centered around ICICI Bank, Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;T), and ITC among others.  ICICI Bank, which is one of the best performing bank stocks right now, has 52 ‘buy’ calls and just one ‘hold’ call, translating into an optimism score of 98 percent. The company has been delivering expectation-beating earnings for a while now and has become the apple of analysts’ eye. Analysts have praised its top-of-the-class net interest margins and investments into technology that is reaping rewards now.  L&amp;amp;T also has an optimism score of 98 percent with 40 ‘buy’ calls and a solitary ‘sell’ call. The stock is regarded as the best play on the infrastructure boom in India. The company is building some of the most important projects in the country including the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train project. It also has maintained its run rate of fresh orders resulting in revenue visibility, analysts underline.  Cigarette maker ITC is also one of analysts' top favourites with an optimism score of 97 percent. As many as 35 analysts are bullish on the stock with one analyst with a ‘hold’ call. The stock is also one of the best blue-chip performers of the current calendar year with returns of 51 percent.  Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and State Bank of India (SBI) are two more stocks in the financial space that have the same optimism score – 96 percent. HDFC – the largest mortgage lender in India – is in process of merging with HDFC Bank which analysts  believe will be value accretive. Hence, the stock has also attracted investors. Meanwhile, SBI which is the largest bank in the country is riding on a high credit growth phase and relatively cheaper valuations.  Two top life insurers – SBI Life Insurance and HDFC Life Insurance – are the next two stocks where optimism is high. Insurance penetration in India remains very low and it is likely to go up as awareness increases. Analysts are banking on this trend and are bullish on these stocks.  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, UPL, and NTPC are others in the top 10 where analysts are most bullish. Analysts believe Sun Pharma is likely to gain from ramping up sales in the US. It will also benefit from rupee depreciation. NTPC is investing heavily in new energy which will become another source of revenue for the firm and hence grabbed attention.  IT, metals continue to face flak For another month, metals and IT sectors remained the pockets where analysts were not as bullish. JSW Steel, Wipro and Shree Cement were among the top stocks where the pessimism score was the highest. Pessimism score refers to the percentage of analysts that are not bullish on a stock.  JSW Steel, which is a victim of rich valuation and declining metal prices, has 17 ‘sell’ calls and 9 ‘hold’ calls compared to 7 ‘buy’ calls. The steelmaker is also likely to face a slowdown in export sales as western countries will be under recessionary pressure that will lead to fall in demand.  Wipro, along with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies, are IT stocks that are part of this list. IT companies, being export-facing, are also bearing the brunt of the slowdown in Europe and the US. Any recessionary phase leads to lesser tech spending and hence analysts have cut down their expectations.  Besides them, FMCG majors Britannia Industries and Nestle India are others that are seeing a concentration of pessimism. Both companies have been struggling with a slowdown in demand in rural India, which is likely to become even more challenging as kharif sowing has been lower than expectations. That means rural income is likely to be lower going ahead. Rich valuations of both stocks is also playing spoilsport for them.

The company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the government's thrust on improving public infrastructure in the country.","Larsen and Toubro (L&amp;amp;T) was the only Nifty stock with every analyst holding a bullish view on it as of August-end, data available with Bloomberg shows. All 41 analysts tracking the stock advise buying it. ICICI Bank and ITC – two of the Street favourites in recent months given how much they have rallied – followed with all but one analyst having a ‘buy’ rating on them.  Since mid-June, L&amp;amp;T has rallied 31 percent. The company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the government's thrust on improving public infrastructure in the country. As of June-end, the consolidated order book of the group was at a record Rs 3,63,448 crore, with international orders having a share of 28 percent.  ICICI Bank, which is arguably the best performing large private bank, continues to hold a favourable position among analysts. Out of 53 analysts who track the stock, 52 have BUY calls while one has 'hold' call, the data shows. The stock has also delivered 27 percent since mid-June when the market had hit a recent low.  ITC, which is on a dream run since February, is the third most favourite stock among analysts with just one of 37 analysts having a 'hold' rating while others advising to 'buy' the stock. ITC is the cheapest available FMCG stock and the company has seen a strong growth in revenue. The outlook for its hotel, and paper businesses have also improved.  HDFC, which is in process to merge with HDFC Bank, and SBI are the next two stocks where analysts see value emerging. The former is the largest mortgage lender whose merger is likely to be value accretive, according to money managers and analysts. Whereas the latter is the largest banking entity in India that many analysts believe is undervalued. Both these stocks are also beneficiaries of increased credit growth in recent quarters.  SBI Life Insurance Co, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, UPL, NTPC and Apollo Hospitals Enterprise are the next five names where analysts are overwhelmingly positive.  SBI Life delivered strong growth in June quarter. Analysts say the company has diverse distribution network, has been investing in technology which provides a robust base to ensure steady growth. On the other hand, Sun Pharma is attracting analysts thanks to its growth in speciality segment. NTPC has been adding capacity in not just traditional sources but also in solar, which will likely to reap rewards going ahead.  Analysts are positive on Apollo Hospitals as they see its superior positioning in the pharmacy segment through and enhanced outlook for healthcare services segment to work for the stock.  IT remains out of favour JSW Steel continues to have a high number of 'sell' and 'hold' calls – 16 and 9, respectively – as analysts find it to be overvalued, especially given the diminishing growth avenues for the steel sector. International metal prices are down 30-40 percent from their peak, which means steel companies are getting lesser revenue on selling the same amount of steel.  Sector-wise, IT has the largest representation among those stocks where analysts are most pessimistic. As many as three names from the sector – Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Technologies – are in the top 10 list. Analysts have turned cautious on the IT sector, fearing recession in their key western markets and declining margins for the last couple of quarters. Shares of IT companies have also seen heavy selling in recent months partly due to these reasons and in part due to global sell-off in technology stocks.  Similarly, analysts continue to be pessimistic about FMCG majors Britannia Industries and Nestle India. They believe them to be overvalued stocks. Both these firms have also struggled to grow in rural markets in recent quarters. Now the monsoon has been erratic, and with lower sowing rural income will likely be affected. This may add further to the woes of Britannia and Nestle in rural market.  Shree Cement and Asian Paints – two names serving the infra sector – have been facing declining margins, especially when raw material prices have been a concern. Though to be fair, some of these concerns have abated but analysts maintain their cautious stance on the stock.  Both names have also been facing pressure from new entrants in their respective industries, which may lead to lower margins for some time as competition will intensify, say analysts.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/l-pessimism-centres-around-it-fmcg-9131431.html,1,1.0

ITC,2022-09-02T13:51:54+05:30,2022-09-02,Bloomberg,Adani Transmission dwarfs market giants in value with shares surging 125%,"Shares of the power utility climbed almost 125 percent this year, boosting its market capitalisation to Rs 4.4 trillion on Friday, surpassing LIC and ITC","Adani Transmission Ltd has blown past entrenched corporate giants to become India’s 10th-largest listed firm by market value as part of a broader runaway rally in Adani Group stocks.  Shares of the New Delhi-based power utility have climbed almost 125 percent this year, boosting its market capitalization to Rs 4.4 trillion ($55.2 billion) in Mumbai on Friday. Its valuation surpassed Life Insurance Corp. of India - the country’s largest insurer - and cigarettes-to-cookies maker ITC Ltd.  Adani Transmission’s pole-vault up the market capitalization table underpins the broader trend among Adani’s seven listed firms that have fueled a blistering $64 billion surge in the tycoon’s wealth. With shares of some of his firms gaining over 1,000 percent since the beginning of 2020, Adani has speedily emerged as the world’s third-richest person with a net worth of almost $141 billion, despite concerns by some analysts around his empire’s debt-fueled expansion and diversification.    There’s also a general sense of puzzlement around why the tycoon’s businesses are trading at far higher valuation ratios than local and global peers, seemingly beyond what their business prospects would justify. Adani Transmission is trading at more than 300 times its one-year forward earnings, making it the most expensive stock in the sector globally, including American Electric Power Company and Duke Energy Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The utility firm’s shares may have been partially buoyed by investor hopes that the Indian government’s attempts to transform the country’s power sector will benefit the nation’s only pure-play, private-sector listed firm in this business. Adani Transmission will be a key beneficiary once changes in electricity distribution are implemented, Lavina Quadros, an analyst at Jefferies India Pvt., wrote in a note last month.  But those benefits from reforms are yet to trickle in. Adani Transmission reported a more than 15 percent drop in profit to 10 billion rupees for the year through March, while revenue surged 13.4 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Profit for the latest quarter ended June 30 also slipped 57 percent.  Some analysts question the sustainability of this rally across Adani Group firms.  “Among the biggest foreign investors in some Adani firms are a few Mauritius-based funds, having 95% of their assets in these companies,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Nitin Chanduka. “Such concentrated positions and negligible onshore ownership, could create asymmetric risk-reward for investors.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/adani-transmission-dwarfs-market-giants-in-value-with-shares-surging-125-9121741.html,1,1.0

Nearly all of them saw a year-on-year fall in operating profit margins, despite trying to pass on price hikes by shrinking packet sizes and raising the mark-up.  Operating profit margins of the biggest listed FMCG players dropped by an average of 258bps year on year; PAT margins fell by an average 197.87bps year on year.    (Graphic by Rajesh Chawla; data compiled by Ritesh Presswala)  Marico and Tata Consumer beat this sectoral trend though.  Marico’s  EBITDA margin for this June quarter was 20.64%, which was slightly higher than last June quarter’s 19.05% and considerably more than this March quarter’s 16.01%. This was because of an unexpected dip in the price of copra, which accounts for half of its input costs.   Tata Consumer’s EBITDA margin went up year on year but fell quarter on quarter. Its yoy numbers are better despite rise in input costs and higher ad spends. Going by the press release from the company, their salt portfolio continues to grow at a healthy pace with double-digit, yoy increase this quarter too, despite its high base last June quarter. The premium salt portfolio recorded a 36% growth during the quarter. Its Kannan Devan tea brand has also reported “outstanding” growth because of brand building and on-ground execution.  Also read: GST on unbranded goods will level the field: Adani Wilmar's Angshu Mallick  Shrinking percentages  Godrej Consumer seems to have had the deepest fall of 420 bps in EBITDA margin year on year; that said, the margin did go up quarter on quarter by 67 bps. The company’s sales volume declined by 5% yoy and its revenue growth of 8% was largely price led, which impacted demand. According to ICICI Securities, home improvement had a weak quarter and price increases in personal wash impacted offtake. “Margin trajectory further weakened (RM and also mix-led) but is likely to have bottomed out,” wrote the analysts. Its international business has weighed heavily on the margins too. While its India business’ operating profits fell by 4%, profits from international markets such as Indonesia and Africa fell by 34%.   Nestle and Emami saw the second and third-steepest fall in operating profit margins year on year, with 404 bps and 341 bps drops respectively. Nestle’s profitability was affected by elevated price levels of milk, green coffee and wheat. Analysts at ICICI Direct also think that higher freight cost due to sharp increase in fuel prices have affected the company’s bottom line. The analysts add that, with Nestle intent on growing its volumes, it is reluctant to pass on higher input costs to consumers. “Though, the company is undertaking cost rationalisation measures, the recovery is margins would come with considerable dip in commodity prices,” they wrote in a report.  Shrinking packages  High wheat and palm-oil prices were a drag on Britannia’s EBITDA margins, which fell to 13.7%, from 16.52% a year ago and 15.67 a quarter ago. A large portion of Britannia’s sales come from biscuits and high-protein food (70% of sales) and bread, cake and rusk contribute the second-largest share (18%).   Though their consolidated revenue went up by 9%, volumes fell by 2% yoy, possibly because of the sharp price increases of around 11% yoy they took, according to Nomura. “Sharp price increases of c.11%, driven two-thirds by grammage cuts in convenience price-point packs (c.50-50% of volumes and c.40% value) and one-third from MRP increases weighed on volumes,” stated its report.  Colgate has been trying to be more margin focussed over the last few quarters, according to ICICI Securities. After posting healthy margins for the last many quarters, the company’s EBITDA margin hit a 9-month low this June quarter, their report added.  Inflationary inputs, especially of packaging material, and an adverse product mix dragged down the margins, according to the analysts.  These are the two factors that put pressure on Dabur’s margins too. The company’s operating margin fell to 19.26% from 21.14% a year ago (rose from 18.01% a quarter ago). The product mix was adverse because the share of foods went up and that of healthcare declined, according to a Jefferies report. According to the brokerage, half of the gross margin decline (around 100 bps) was because of the adverse mix.  While the company did manage to pass on higher costs to consumers by increasing prices by 5% and decreasing grammage by 1%, inflation in the basket was higher at 9%.  Heavy ad spends  Advertising spends shot up for HUL in this quarter, by 30% year on year. It was Rs 1,328 crore in Q1FY23 versus Rs 1,024 crore in Q1FY22. This was because of the new product launches, according to a Nomura report. The second-highest expenditure on its books was for materials, which saw a 27.2% rise year on year. It was Rs 7,514 crore in Q1FY23 versus Rs 5,905 crore in Q1FY22. The brokerage expects the second quarter margins to contract sequentially too,  because the company has high-price inventory, and stated in its report that only in the third quarter will softening prices of inputs start to improve margins.   The segment that delivered the largest share of EBITDA margin (29% of the margin) was Beauty and Personal Care. But, its profitability shrunk year on year–with the EBITDA margin falling by 184bps, to 26.3% from 28.1%. The company posted strong sales numbers in soaps and hair care, but its mass-consumption portfolio with Glow &amp;amp; Lovely and Talc and Colour Cosmetics are still selling at pre-Covid levels because consumers picked essentials/staples in the face of inflation, said the report.

The company’s FMCG vertical reported healthy growth in revenues too, up 20% yoy thanks to schools reopening, demand for out-of-home goods keeping up and “a decent show in staples and convenience foods”.

ITC,2022-07-25T13:49:57+05:30,2022-07-25,Devika Singh,"Another quarter of pain ahead for FMCG, indicate biggies HUL, ITC","FMCG companies have now pinned hopes on the monsoon, which could bring about revival in the rural economy and spur sluggish consumption.","Non-durables companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) and ITC Ltd expect inflation to disrupt business for another quarter unless the monsoon revives the rural economy and spurs consumption. Top executives of both companies recently indicated that while the prices of some inputs have eased in June, those of several others remained elevated and were even at 10-year highs.  “There are some early signs of moderation but the situation is dynamic and we need to monitor it,” ITC chairman and managing director Sanjiv Puri said while addressing a virtual press conference last week after announcing the results for the first quarter.  Puri indicated that the trajectory of cost increases is difficult to predict given the supply-side challenges and green inflation as agri-commodities are being diverted for biofuel.  “I sense that there will be some moderation as the signs show but inflation will remain at an elevated level as compared to the past,” he added.  HUL, another fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) giant, also expects inflation to persist for at least another quarter. According to the company’s management, the commodity markets have inflated further sequentially in the June quarter and prices of most commodities are at very high levels.  “While the correction in some commodities like palm oil happened in the end weeks of June, we had already secured our inventory and incurred high costs on it,” said Ritesh Tiwari, executive director of finance and chief financial officer, HUL.  “Due to consumption of this inventory (in Q2) and many other commodities like crude oil, caustic soda and plastics, whose prices remain elevated, our September quarter net material inflation will be higher than June quarter,” he added.  The price of crude oil, according to HUL, was up 60 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in the June quarter, while caustic soda was 125 percent costlier. The prices of two other key commodities—palm oil and polyethylene—were up 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively, y-o-y in the June quarter.  Read: Hotel business de-merger ‘very much’ on table, says ITC chief Sanjiv Puri  Margins to remain impacted  Given the challenges the inflationary trend pose, margins of these companies will remain under pressure in the coming quarters, indicated HUL and analysts. FMCG companies for several quarters now have been struggling with dented margins as inflation kicked up costs but a tepid demand scenario made it difficult to pass on the increase to consumers. HUL’s gross margins and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margins for the quarter gone by were down by 327 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.  “In the June quarter, the net material inflation was about 20 percent of our total cost. In the September quarter, the impact on the books would be based on the inventory that we have booked already and if the prices taper down going ahead, then we will see an impact coming in our books from the December quarter onwards,” Sanjiv Mehta, CEO and MD, HUL, said last week.  HUL’s top management has indicated that the second quarter will see more inflation than the first quarter and margins will remain under pressure and softening of some commodity prices will positively impact sequential margins from the third quarter onwards.  Eye on the monsoon  FMCG companies are now relying on a good monsoon now, which they hope will revive the rural economy, a big catchment area for these firms. Demand has been tepid for several quarters cityside as well.  The annual rainfall season, however, so far has remained below expectations in some parts. “There are still pockets of the country, especially, the central belt, where the monsoon has not been good so far. But if it covers up, going ahead then it will be one good factor,” said Mehta.  According to data from analytics firm Nielsen, sales volumes of the FMCG segment fell 5 percent in the quarter gone by. While value growth came in at 7 percent for the first quarter of FY23, it was, however, mostly price-led. While the urban segment is faring slightly better than rural India, indicated an industry executive, when seen over a three-year period, the volume growth of both segments has been flat.  Government initiatives such as fertiliser subsidy should also benefit the economy and help the country out of this crisis, said HUL’s Mehta.  On his part, Puri of ITC indicated that better realisations by farmers can help revive the economy.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/another-quarter-of-pain-ahead-for-fmcg-indicate-biggies-hul-itc-8882721.html,1,1.0
ITC,2022-07-21T14:11:05+05:30,2022-07-21,Devika Singh,"Hotel business de-merger ‘very much’ on table, says ITC chief Sanjiv Puri","Sanjiv Puri, chairman and managing director, ITC, said that the company will be exploring an alternate structure for the hotels business","Cigarettes-to-hotels conglomerate ITC is considering a de-merger of its hotel business, the company’s chairman and managing director Sanjiv Puri said at a press conference on July 21.  “We had shared plans about an alternate structure for the hotel business before the pandemic, however, with COVID-19 we had to hold it back,” Puri said.  “We have reiterated in the annual report and the AGM that we will take ahead the plan in line with industry recovery dynamics. And now that there are indications of industry on a positive trajectory, it is very much on the table,” he added.  ITC runs 113 properties under its hotel business. It launched 9 hotels in FY22 and has a healthy pipeline of new properties which will be opened over the next few quarters, said Puri while speaking at the company’s 111th Annual General (AGM) on July 20.  While the business had taken a hard blow due to the pandemic, with life returning to normal it is on the path to recovery. Puri indicated as much while speaking at the AGM.  “Undoubtedly, the last two years have been the most challenging for the travel and hospitality sector worldwide. Your company's hotels business responded with commendable agility to tap alternate customer cohorts and garner new revenue streams,” he said.  “The segment revenue for the year doubled whilst segment PBIT turned positive in the second half of FY22. The resurgent trend in domestic tourism, MICE and banqueting highlight the immense opportunities for trusted brands like ITC Hotels in a post-pandemic era,” added Puri.  Besides the hotel business, the chairman also indicated a ‘possible listing’ of the IT business under ITC Infotech and said the company is evaluating the plan.  The company is also giving a major push to its recently launched app for farmers — ITCMAARS.  Bid to tap agri value chain  With the launch of ITCMAARS app, ITC aims to equip farmers with the latest information and technology, which will help them better their yields and ultimately raise their income. The digital platform provides farmers with AI/ML driven value-added personalised and hyperlocal crop advisories. These include a customised ‘crop calendar’ for scientific planning of crop cycles, a ‘crop Doctor’ function for real-time resolution of crop infestation, access to good quality inputs and market linkages, real-time soil testing, precision farming and so on.  The app will also connect the farmer with farmer producer organisations (FPOs), and companies and offer them services such as loans. The company, indicated Puri, will also look at onboarding insurance and other offerings on the app later.  &quot;The newly launched super-app ITCMAARS is designed to provide maximum support to marginal farmers at their doorsteps, to give them the benefits of the best in technology and access to markets. For me, ITC MAARS will be a success when it makes a meaningful contribution to multiplying farmer incomes and making India’s agri value chains competitive,&quot; said Puri.  “There are about 140 million farmers in India and we need to bring them together to make an impact at scale,” he added.  The app will be free for use for the farmers, however, ITC plans to monetise it through service providers such as creditors, insurers etc. The app already had onboarded about 200 FPOs and over 40,000 farmers. ITCMAARS has now been launched in seven states.  “The aim is to have 10 million farmers and 4,000 FPOs,” the chairman shared.  An FPO or Farmer Producer Organisation is a voluntary collective of farmers.  NPD key for FMCG  The company, indicated Puri, will continue its high frequency of new product development (NPD) in the FMCG segment. Last year, ITC introduced 110 products in the FMCG segment under its brands like Aashirvaad, Sunfeast, Bingo and Yippee. ITC in FY22 extended its staples brand Aashirvaad to categories like organic foods, frozen breads and vermicelli, Sunfeast beyond biscuits to cakes and Savlon to surface disinfectant sprays.  “Today the consumer access points and the channels are getting transformed. And every channel has its own unique characteristics and unique consumer preferences emerge in these channels. So, some of the new products are meant to cater to the emerging channels. And hence launched will remain elevated over a period of time,” said Puri.  ITC is also now looking at aggressively expanding its FMCG portfolio to overseas markets.  “As we achieve scale for your company’s FMCG portfolio, it is also our aspiration to take these world-class brands to overseas markets. ITC has established distribution arrangements abroad enabling appreciable progress of exports of ITC’s brands to over 60 countries,” Puri said at the company’s AGM.  “Over time, such exports will make a substantial contribution to the growth of your company’s value-added FMCG portfolio.”",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/hotel-business-de-merger-very-much-on-table-itc-chief-sanjiv-puri-8863721.html,0,0.0

ITC,2022-07-15T13:34:51+05:30,2022-07-15,Shubham Raj,"After 40% rally, ITC stock struggles to cross Rs 300. What should you do?","While a few analysts advise booking some profit now, others suggest it’s only a matter of time before the ITC stock resumes its rally.","Any fan of Sachin Tendulkar will remember the Nervous 90s – how everyone watching TV would start praying as soon as he scored 90, given his track record of getting out frequently before 100. A similar nervousness can be felt among investors in ITC shares.  The stock cruised from Rs 210 to Rs 290 over 87 sessions, shrugging off years of sluggishness and giving die-hard fans an I-told-you-so moment. However, it hasn’t been able to cross the Rs 300 mark, even after flirting with that level for 10 sessions now.  Over the past 2-3 years, the ITC stock has been known to rally and then retrace its steps, which is why investors are keeping their fingers crossed now.  It’s not as though the stock became expensive after a 41 percent rally since February. It’s still the cheapest consumer stock, trading at 23 times earnings compared with Hindustan Unilever and Godrej Consumer, which trade at upwards of 60 times. A high dividend yield also adds to its attractiveness.  ITC notched up sales of over Rs 65,000 crore in FY22 from diverse business verticals that include cigarettes, hotels, packaged foods, personal care, agri-business, paper and packaging, and information technology.  A breather  Fundamental analysts said investors should not read too much into ITC’s struggle around the Rs 300 level and consider it just a breather before the next leg of the rally. They said tailwinds for the stock are very strong.  ITC rallied this after the outlook for its agri-businesses improved amid a sharp rise in demand and prices for cereals and food grains across the world. Even though some commodity prices have come down, there are other factors working in favour of the stock, notably rising cigarette sales volumes.  The company said in its annual report that volumes for the cigarette business – which is its cash cow – surpassed pre-pandemic levels in the latter half of the previous financial year.  “We like ITC not only because it has started witnessing growth in cigarette volumes and profitability but also because of the possibility of demerger and value unlocking the potential for various businesses of ITC, including hospitality, FMCG, and IT,” said Nishit Master, portfolio manager at Axis Securities.  The company has not committed to demerging many of its asset-heavy businesses – as sought by investors – although it has said it is “certainly open to seeing what is right to create value for shareholders.”  Mohit Nigam, head - PMS, Hem Securities, lauded ITC’s financial performance in FY22, especially high cigarette volumes. Revenue from cigarettes rose 16 percent to Rs 26,158 crore in FY22.  “Stable tax environment in the cigarette segment would result in improved margins and volume growth of this segment. Also the stock has a dividend yield which attracts investors in this volatile interest rate environment,” he said.  ITC’s dividend for FY22 amounted to Rs 11.50 per share of Re 1 each.  Some of ITC’s asset-heavy businesses have started performing better. The outlook for its hotel business has improved after pandemic restrictions were lifted and tourism resumed in full flow.  The company said profit before interest and taxes from the hotel segment for the second half of the year turned positive against a loss of Rs 107.43 crore in the corresponding period a year earlier.  The paper and packaging business has also picked up amid the ban on single-use plastic and the reopening of schools and colleges.  One factor that went against ITC was the trend of investors avoiding companies that score low on ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance). ITC lagged in this aspect because of its tobacco business. However, opinions seem to be changing now.  “With the importance of ESG slightly diminishing among global investors, there is a high possibility of further foreign investor inflows in the stock, supporting the stock price movement upwards,” Master of Axis added.  Buy or sell?  Fundamental analysts are gung-ho about the ITC stock, with 31 ‘buy’ recommendations and four ‘hold’ calls as of June, according to Bloomberg data. Some technical analysts said it’s time to book profit.  “After a sharp move on the upside and testing the high point of 293.65, ITC has formed a large black candle,” said Milan Vaishnav, Founder of ChartWizard FZE (UAE) and Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory Services. “The occurrence of such a candle near the high point after a strong move on the upside may lead to formation of a potential top.”  He said for traders who are long on the stock, it is best advised to book and protect some profit and take money off the table. Those contemplating a fresh entry should go long only after the stock crosses Rs 300, he added.  Manish Shah, founder of Niftytriggers.com, said heavy buying recently pushed the stock’s 14-trading day relative strength index into an overbought zone.  “We frequently see price taking a pause once it hits an overbought zone. This is what is happening in ITC,” he said.  He said the moving averages are in a BUY mode and the price is trading above its resistance zone at Rs 280-285.  “Notwithstanding small corrective declines, the underlying current remains bullish. ITC remains in a strong uptrend and it is a matter of time before the rally resumes,” Shah said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/after-40-rally-itc-stock-struggles-to-cross-rs-300-what-should-you-do-8832921.html,0,0.0

Since October 2021, the index has been in a gradual downward move. On weekly chart, Nifty is forming lower high, lower low pattern, indicating negative undertone of the index.  By looking at daily charts, we observed that the level of 15,930 has acted as a strong resistance since last 4 days, which is in sync with the gap which occurred on June 13, 2022 around the zone of 16,172–15,886.  On the downside, Nifty has a strong support at 15,367 (swing low) and 15,183 (low of June 2022).  We feel that the current trend in Nifty is rangebound between 15,930 and 15,367 but is negative-biased. If the Nifty breaches below 15,367 level then it will further down till 15,183 level.  Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:  Linde India: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,198 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,651 | Target: Rs 4,200 | Return: 31 percent  On weekly chart of Linde India, we can spot that the overall trend of the stock is positive as it is maintaining higher top, higher bottom pattern since February 2021.  Prices have shown a bounce back from the level around Rs 2,945, which is 38.2 percent retracement of its prior advance from the level Rs 885 (February 2021) till Rs 4,186 (April 2022). Around the same level (Rs 2,945) we witnessed a breakout of rounding bottom pattern in the month of March 2022 for which prices took 24 weeks to form and also we identified change in polarity of prices around this level.  Prices have taken support from the trendline which has been respecting since February 2021 and have shown closing above its 5 weeks high. The uptrend is followed by high volumes.  On indicator front, relative strength index (RSI) is above 50 on multiple time frames i.e Daily, Weekly and Monthly, indicating bullish momentum.  Going ahead, we expect the prices to move at higher levels towards Rs 4,000, post which we might see a move towards Rs 4,200 levels. We recommend a stop-loss of Rs 2,651 on daily closing basis.    TVS Motor Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 842 | Stop-Loss: Rs 765 | Target: Rs 1,000 | Return: 19 percent  TVS Motor, on weekly chart, has shown a breakout from Cup &amp;amp; Handle pattern which has been forming since December 2017. The stock has also made fresh all-time high at Rs 850 in this week.  The stock has been forming bullish pattern of higher top higher bottom since last 7 weeks.  On the indicator front, the RSI plotted on higher time frames is above 50 mark and rising, which indicates bullish sentiment in the stock.  Going ahead, we might see the prices move higher towards Rs 1,000 mark. We recommend a strict stop-loss of Rs 765 on daily closing basis.    ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 273.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 250 | Target: Rs 350 | Return: 28 percent  In ITC, on weekly chart, we witnessed that prices are forming higher high, higher low formation. Prices have shown a bounce back from 20 weeks simple moving average (SMA), which acted as a variable support for the prices.  Around level of Rs 258, we can spot change in the polarity by the prices.  On the indicator front, the RSI plotted on weekly time frame we can spot positive reversal by the prices around over bought zone (70 mark) and the RSI is sustaining above 50 levels, this indicates a bullish sentiment in the stock.  We expect the stock to move higher towards Rs 320 levels and if it managed to cross above Rs 320 then eventually it will move towards Rs 350 levels. One should maintain a strict stop-loss of Rs 250 on daily closing basis for this trade.

ITC,2022-06-24T14:17:33+05:30,2022-06-24,PTI,GST Council may consider changes in monthly GST payment form,"The move would help curb the menace of fake billing, whereby sellers would show higher sales in GSTR-1 to enable purchasers to claim input tax credit (ITC), but report suppressed sales in GSTR-3B to lower GST liability.","The GST Council in its meeting next week is likely to consider a proposal for making changes in the monthly tax payment form — GSTR-3B, which would include auto-population of outward supplies from sales return and non-editable tax payment table, officials said. The move would help curb the menace of fake billing, whereby sellers would show higher sales in GSTR-1 to enable purchasers to claim input tax credit (ITC), but report suppressed sales in GSTR-3B to lower GST liability. Currently, GSTR-3B of a taxpayer includes auto drafted input tax credit (ITC) statements based on inward and outward B2B supplies and also red flags any mismatch between GSTR-1 and 3B. As per the changes proposed by the Law Committee of the GST Council, there will be auto-population of values from GTSR-1 into GSTR-3B in specific rows to establish one-to-one correspondence to a large extent between rows of the two return forms, thereby providing clarity to the taxpayer and tax officers. The change would minimize the requirement of user input in GSTR-3B and ease the GSTR-3B filing process, an official said. The tax payment table in Form GSTR-3B will be auto-populated from other tables in the form and will be non-editable, as per the amended form recommended by the Law Committee of the Council. Noting that amendment in Form GSTR-3B, as far as feasible, should flow from amendment in Form GSTR-1, with regard to outward liabilities, the Committee suggested that for giving more clarity to the taxpayers, separate amendment table (for liabilities) may be introduced in GSTR-3B, so that any amendment made in Form GSTR-1 gets reflected in GSTR-3B clearly. Similarly, an amendment table may also be incorporated in GSTR-3B to show any amendment in the ITC portion, the Committee suggested. Once the changes proposed by the Law Committee gets an in-principle approval of the GST Council, the revamped form will be put in public domain for stakeholder consultation. The GST Council in a meeting later will then approve the final form. Currently, taxpayers file statements of outward supplies in GSTR-1 by the 11th day of the subsequent month, while taxes are paid by filing GSTR-3B between 20th, 22nd and 24th of every month for different categories of taxpayers. Commenting on the proposed changes in GSTR-3B, AMRG &amp;amp; Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said tax filings are set to change for e-commerce operators rendering passenger transportation services, accommodation services, housekeeping services, and cloud kitchens. Such e-commerce players would now be made liable to report supplies on behalf of suppliers in their GSTR -1 and GSTR-3B in separate cells. ”E-commerce players like Uber, Swiggy, Zomato and MMT would see few changes in monthly tax filings that will ensure more data points for the government system for big data analytics,” Mohan added.

In its annual report for 2021-22, the company also highlighted the need for policy interventions that are &quot;sharply focused on supporting sustainable livelihoods and fostering inclusive growth&quot; as the economy faces the immediate challenges of muted consumption, persistently high inflationary headwinds and supply chain disruptions.  The operating environment in FY22 remained &quot;extremely challenging&quot; and was marked by heightened uncertainty and volatility due to the COVID pandemic and unprecedented inflationary headwinds; geopolitical tensions towards the end of the year exacerbated the situation. The year also saw an unprecedented increase in prices of key inputs such as edible oils, packaging materials, soap noodles, fuel, logistics, etc. which exerted considerable pressure on margins.  The unprecedented increase in prices of key inputs was mitigated through focused cost management interventions across the value chain, premiumisation, product mix enrichment, judicious pricing actions and fiscal incentives, it added. During the year, ITC said the FMCG industry witnessed moderation in growth mainly due to subdued demand conditions especially in rural markets, high inflation eating into household budgets and high base effect in certain categories such as staples and convenience foods.  Health and hygiene, personal care products witnessed demand volatility in line with varying intensity of the pandemic, while remaining significantly above pre-pandemic levels. On the challenges ahead, the company said, &quot;Inflation continues to remain a key monitorable for your Company in the near term.&quot;  The company continues to take proactive measures to counter the impact of such headwinds across all nodes of operations and deliver competitively superior performance leveraging its institutional strengths and harnessing advantages of scale, smart buying initiatives and world-class talent in a consumer-centric, agile and innovative manner, it said. On the macroeconomic front, ITC said up until January 2022, near-term prospects for the Indian economy seemed extremely promising with all sectors of the economy, including the contact-intensive service sector, having made a steady recovery.  &quot;However, sustained inflationary headwinds and outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict leading to extended global disruptions and spiralling of commodity prices have led to downward revisions to the growth forecast for 2022,&quot; it said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/inflation-continues-to-remain-a-key-monitorable-in-the-near-term-says-itc-8724841.html,1,1.0
ITC,2022-06-21T10:37:30+05:30,2022-06-21,Shubham Raj,Time to get greedy? Analysts pick these 19 stocks for a volatile market,Analysts advise investors to be cautious if they want to buy at this juncture and say that they should stagger investments over the next few months,"Warren Buffett famously said one should be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful. In the last couple of months, fear has been rising swiftly in the market. Time to get greedy?  A sharp fall in markets is usually a good opportunity to buy shares at cheaper valuations. Thanks to the recent selling, benchmark indices are down 18 percent from all their all-time highs. Stocks from broader markets have fared even worse, some are trading 50-80 percent down from their 52-week high.  Analysts, however, advise caution to those looking to buy and say avoid investing in one go. Staggered buying over the next few months is likely a good idea, analysts Moneycontrol talked to said.  They talked about multiple themes that can create wealth in the medium to long term and identified 19 stocks that are ripe for picking.  Auto in top gear   Akhilesh Jat, Category Manager-Equity Research, Capitalvia Global Research, recommended the auto sector that has outperformed the market in the calendar year 2022 after an underperformance of many years.  The recovery has been led by a growth in the sales of utility vehicles and commercial vehicles, given India is in the midst of revival after Covid 19 resulted in more vehicle usage, Jat said.  Timely and a normal monsoon and the government’s move to reduce steel prices are positive for auto stocks. High food prices favour farmers that may help revive tractors as well as two-wheeler demand in rural areas.  “Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, and Tata Motors are the top stocks among the sectors in which one can invest,” Jat said.  Go defensive  Data shows one in four stocks listed on BSE is down more than 50 percent from its 52-week high. Nine in 10 stocks are down 20 percent from their 52-week highs.  Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, has a cautious view and said the volatile trend will continue in the short to medium-term because of the hawkish policy, which in the worst case can carry to H1CY23.  “Economy is expected to contract and corporate earnings to downgrade. During this phase, investment is suggested in stable entities, large and blue-chip companies with a focus on defensives,” Nair said.  His three recommendations are:  Dabur: Though margins pressure is expected in the short-term due to steep cost inflation, the impact is not significant for Dabur India, as a large part of raw material is non-crude and non-palm commodities. Increasing market share of the company on account of strong brand and distribution will support volumes, though steep inflation can impact overall consumer sentiments in the short term.  HDFC Bank: HDFC Banks future growth trajectory remains positive on lines of the merger prospects and resumption of digital operations. The recent correction along with its strong fundaments have made the bank an attractive investment avenue for long term investors.  Zydus Life Sciences: The company is supported by healthy growth pipeline for its niche products, competitive pricing, and an innovative and diversified portfolio which is in various stages of development. Nair expects earnings to grow at a healthy 16 percent CAGR over FY22-24.  The green sweetener   The other theme that is likely to benefit from market headwinds is the renewable energy. Vinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research, Ventura Securities, said oil and natural gas prices are high and estimated to remain at the current levels due to supply-side disruption, which will accelerate the investments in alternate fuels such as renewable energy and ethanol.  “We recommend Adani Green Energy, Adani Enterprises and NTPC in renewables, while Balrampur Chini, Triveni Engineering Industries, Dwarikesh Sugar and Shree Renuka Sugar in the sugar industry (as ethanol plays),” he said.  The global food shortage will significantly increase the demand for agri-commodities and therefore companies dealing in the agriculture supply chain such as ITC, Adani Wilmar and Uma Exports are expected to gain.  Similarly, some companies that operate in West Asia (Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro, Welspun Corp and DCM Shriram) are expected to get new businesses on the improving prospects for the region amid burgeoning oil prices.

Our channel checks suggest that demand continues to remain robust. There has been relative stability with regard to taxes on Cigarettes in recent years. This has enabled ITC to calibrate its price increases to avoid disrupting demand, unlike the higher tax increase environment between FY13 and FY17. If not for the significant impact of the pandemic, we believe volume growth would have been 3-4% v/s 1-2% over the previous decade. With the intensity of further COVID-19 waves decreasing, we now expect a volume growth of 3-4% over the next couple of years, especially if the tax incidence remains benign. The Cigarette mix has been getting richer, aided by innovation, improved local manufacturing of capsule cigarettes, and better last-mile reach. With lower RM inflation and little evidence of downtrading so far, margin resilience is evidently superior to other Consumer categories. Outlook We value the stock at 21x FY24E EPS.

Although we expect near term margin pressure in FMCG, strong traction in other businesses will enable ITC to sustain double digit profit growth.  We increase the valuation of cigarettes to 16x on improving growth and stable taxation (versus 15x earlier) and assign higher multiples for FMCG and paper business. We increase SOTP (sum of the parts) based target price to Rs 305 (from Rs 285 earlier). Maintain buy.  Sharekhan  Cigarette sales volume are expected to improve in coming quarters. ITC has enhanced focus and redefined growth strategies for all business verticals to improve prospects in the medium to long term.  Strong earnings visibility with improving prospects of core cigarette business, margin expansion in non-cigarette FMCG business and a high cash generation ability with strong dividend payout (dividend yield of 4.3 percent in FY22) will reduce valuation gap in coming years.  We maintain buy on the stock with a revised price target of Rs 320.  Motilal Oswal  ITC’s re-rating would depend on sustained earnings growth going back to high-teens witnessed in the first half of the last decade (18 percent compound annual growth rate) which had slowed to 6.6 percent CAGR over the latter half. Valuation at 17x FY24, although cheap, appears fair.  We value ITC at a 15 percent premium over the global cigarette peer average, aiming for 17x FY24 earnings per share to arrive at our target price of Rs 265. Retain neutral.  Morgan Stanley  We maintain overweight rating on the stock and raise the target price to Rs 293 from Rs 276 as earnings were largely in line with estimates.  The cigarettes and FMCG earnings before interest and tax was ahead of estimates, while hotels and agriculture were weaker.  The strong results and positive near-term earnings augur well for the stock, CNBC-TV18 reported.  Jefferies  We maintain a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 305.  ITC has seen expanding margin, with smart gains in cigarettes and FMCG.  More than 20 percent growth in operating profit is a key positive for FMCG.  The improvement in dividend pay-out drives up return on equity to seven-year high of 25 percent, CNBC-TV18 reported.  At 15:18 hrs ITC was quoting at Rs 275.20, up Rs 8.70, or 3.26 percent on the BSE.

ITC,2022-05-09T06:20:16+05:30,2022-05-09,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"Trade Spotlight | What should you do with Abbott India, ITC, Power Grid Corporation on Monday?",Power Grid Corporation of India is in a strong uptrend across all timeframes and is approaching an all-time high breakout of Rs 241,"The market was caught in a bear trap on May 6 with the benchmark indices falling 1.6 percent. Selling was seen across sectors, with financial services, technology, metal, banks and auto being prominent losers.  The fear of faster policy tightening by US Federal Reserve and recession and inflation concerns raised by the Bank of England weighed on the sentiment. The Sensex fell nearly 900 points to 54,836, and the Nifty plunged 271 points to 16,411. The correction in the broader space was higher than that for benchmarks.  The Nifty midcap 100 index was down 1.8 percent and the smallcap 100 index declined 2.5 percent.  Stocks that were in action included Hero MotoCorp, Abbott India and Power Grid Corporation, which bucked the trend and were among the top five gainers in the futures &amp;amp; options segment. ITC was the fourth biggest gainer in the Nifty50.  Hero MotoCorp rallied 2.5 percent to Rs 2,563.35, Abbott India rose 2.2 percent to Rs 16,984, and Power Grid Corporation of India gained 2 percent at Rs 238.40. ITC climbed 1.8 percent to Rs 266.65.  Here's what Rajesh Palviya of Axis Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Hero MotoCorp  On the daily chart, the stock has rebounded sharply from Rs 2,146 and confirmed “double bottom” trend reversal pattern. In addition, the stock has confirmed higher top and higher bottom formation, which reconfirms bullish sentiments.  The buying momentum was observed from 20-day simple moving average (SMA) at Rs 2,306 and rebounded sharply. The daily “band Bollinger” buy signal reconfirmed positive bias.  The daily and weekly strength indicator relative strength index (RSI) is in a bullish mode along with positive crossover, which supports rising strength in the near term.  Investors should buy, hold and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 2,800-2,850, with downside support at Rs 2,400-2,350.    Abbott India  The stock is in a down trend on the medium-term time frame but on the short-term chart, we observed strong accumulation within Rs 18,500-15,500, representing a sideways trend. Breakout on either side of the range will confirm further direction.  The upper range also coincides with the 200-day SMA (Rs 18,572), hence any decisive breakout above the same may lead to upside momentum.  The stock is sustaining below its 20, 50 100 and 200- day SMAs, which support bearish sentiment. The daily weekly and monthly strength indicator RSI is bearish, signalling the absence of strength.  Investors should wait and watch for trend reversal above Rs 18,500-18,600, and for existing long positions, Rs 16,000-15,500 level will remain critical support.    ITC  The stock is in a strong up trend across all the time frames as it sustains in higher tops and bottoms formation. It has also been well placed above 20, 50 , 100 and 200 days SMA which reconfirm bullish sentiments.  On the weekly time frame, the stock is scaling upwards within the &quot;up-sloping channel&quot; indicating an up trend. The daily, weekly and monthly strength indicator RSI is in a bullish mode, which signals sustained strength.  Investors should buy, hold and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 285-300, with downside support at Rs 250-245 levels.    Power Grid Corporation of India  The stock is in a strong up trend across all time frames, as it continues to form a series of higher tops and bottoms. The stock is approaching an all-time high breakout level of Rs 241.  Recently, the stock recaptured its 20-day SMA and rebounded sharply.  The weekly Band-Bollinger Buy signal indicates increased momentum. The daily, weekly and monthly strength indicator RSI is in a bullish mode along with positive crossover, which supports strength in the near term.  Investors should buy, hold and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 250-275, with a downside support zone of Rs 230-220.

ITC,2022-04-20T09:58:27+05:30,2022-04-20,Devika Singh,Stirring things up: FMCG firms plan to add a dash of spice,Fast-moving consumer goods companies such as ITC and Tata Consumer Products are trying to get a foothold in the country’s multi-crore spices segment. What makes the category a ‘tough nut to crack’ for FMCG players?,"Earlier in March, speculation was rife about the top fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) acquiring one of the oldest players in the spices segment, Mahashian Di Hatti Pvt. Ltd or MDH. MDH and HUL both denied the move but investors enthused with the reports of the deal, which would have given the largest FMCG company a foothold in the rapidly growing spices segment, where only regional companies have successfully built a play so far.  The spices market in India, according to a report by Avendus Capital, is valued at Rs 70,000 crore, in which branded spices command only a 35 percent share. A paper released by the investment bank last year estimated that the branded spices market is set to double in size by 2025 to Rs 50,000 crore. Avendus estimates that by FY30, 15 spice companies are estimated to exceed Rs 1,000 crore in revenue, and of this, four will achieve ₹5,000 crore in annual turnover.  FMCG companies have so far mostly stayed away from the segment due to its commoditised nature, but the rapid shift of consumers to branded products makes the segment ripe for the picking.  “Till 2000, under the government policy only MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) could sell spices, which limited the entry of large players in the segment. Also, consumers preferred buying spices as commodities and grinding them at home. But that’s changing now and this has triggered the interest of large FMCG companies,” said Ankur Bisen, senior partner and head of the consumer, food and retail practice at consulting firm Technopak.  FMCG in the spices space  Though FMCG companies such as Tata Consumer Products and ITC are trying to gain share in this sector through their brands Tata Sampann and Aashirvaad, respectively, regional players continue to rule the segment.  According to market estimates, Everest, MDH, Sakthi Masala, Aachi and Eastern Condiments are the top players in the packaged spices market. Everest has an 11-12 percent share of the market, MDH 8-9 percent, Sakhti Masala 7 percent, and Aachi and Eastern command 5 percent each, as per industry estimates. About 2,000 brands are competing for a share in the rest of the market (over 50 percent), which makes it a tough segment to crack for FMCG brands. Companies such as ITC and Tata Consumer have managed to gain less than 1 percent share in this market organically so far.  The spices segment can be divided into the subcategories of pure packaged spices and blended spices. Both have their own set of challenges.  Pure spices or commodities are prone to price fluctuations which also impact margins. “The price of the commodities fluctuates frequently and it has to be sourced from mandis, which created bottlenecks for FMCG companies that need supplies in large quantities,” said Sanjesh Thakur, partner, Deloitte India.  The blended spices category, on the other hand, though a high-margin and high-growth category, has its constraints given the varied consumer palate of the country.  “The biggest challenge before any company trying to penetrate this segment is the fact that each region has its spice blend. The way fish curry is cooked in Goa is very different from Maharashtra or West Bengal. Hence, a national-level brand is yet to emerge in this category,” said Thakur.  Pure packaged spices command a margin of 30-35 percent, while companies draw margins of as high as 60 percent from blended spices. The packaged spices market has witnessed a growth rate of 12-15 percent in the last five years, according to industry estimates. The blended spices sub-segment on the other hand has grown at 24-25 percent over the same period.  Consumer goods companies, too, have realised these challenges in the pure and blended spices segment and have taken the inorganic route to tap this segment. ITC in 2020 acquired packaged spices company Sunrise for Rs 2,150 crore. The company is a significant player in the eastern region, with a 15-20 percent share. In West Bengal, Sunrise has a 50 percent share, as per market estimates. Its share nationally, however, is below 5 percent. In another major deal in the segment, Norway’s Orkla Foods acquired Eastern Condiments in 2020 and merged it with MTR Foods, the Bengaluru-based food products company it had bought in 2007.  Finding the right blend  Besides the inorganic route, Tata Consumer and ITC are striving to build a play in the segment organically too. The companies have taken several initiatives such as offering innovative packaging and offering unique blends to edge out regional players.  Tata Consumer and MTR have introduced ziplock packaging for spices to retain their freshness after opening the pack. MTR has introduced “innovative blends” in a bid to outdo regional players. The company has launched spice blends such as Bisibelebath Powder, Vangibath Powder, Tomato Rice Powder, etc.  Tata Consumer is also betting on the consumer shift from the unbranded to branded segment to drive its growth in the category. “There is huge headroom for large players to drive conversion. We are seeing great traction for our pure range of spices as the Tata brand name denotes trust and quality and consumers value this increasingly in a category prone to adulteration,” said Deepika Bhan, president, packaged foods (India), Tata Consumer Products.  ITC is strengthening its distribution in the category and modifying its offerings according to the palate of various regions. “We have customised our products in line with the regional tastes and preferences and have adjusted the delivery on the key parameters in terms of pungency, volatile oil, aroma and the core ingredients itself,” said Ganesh K Sundararaman, SBU chief executive, staples, snacks and meals, foods division, ITC.  “Going forward, the idea is to take the regional specialities to newer markets. We are also looking at introducing new culinary solutions in western cuisine,” he added.  Industry analysts say catering to regional tastes is going to be the top challenge before FMCG companies and, hence, the segment is likely to see further consolidation.  “Spices have always been a regional growth story. All regional players have their flavours and are hence attractive acquisition targets for large FMCG companies,” said Thakur of Deloitte.  “Companies are not likely to start from scratch but acquire these small firms,” he added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/stirring-things-up-fmcg-firms-plan-to-add-a-dash-of-spice-8381411.html,2,2.0
ITC,2022-04-14T12:55:16+05:30,2022-04-14,Devika Singh,FMCG Q4 Preview: Staples set to report another disappointing quarter,Consumer goods companies are operating in a challenging environment as inflation continues to impact their margins and demand scenario.,"Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are set to report another disappointing quarter, indicate analysts, as demand remains tepid while inflation on an upward trajectory continues to dent their margins.  “Facing dual headwinds of weak demand and raw material inflation, consumer staples would see weak earnings print in the fourth quarter, characterised by muted volume growth and year-on-year (y-o-y) margin compression,” said a report by Jeffries.  Companies operating in the discretionary products segment, however, are expected to report a better performance in the fourth quarter. Discretionary products have witnessed a surge in sales with the return of normalcy and easing of Covid-related curbs.  “Even as we note growth moderation in certain discretionary categories, we expect discretionary pack to outperform staples on underlying three-year revenue CAGR (compound annual growth rate)—we estimate staples/discretionary (ex-ITC) pack to register 7-14 percent three-year revenue CAGR,” said a note by Kotak Institutional Securities.  The brokerage expects jewellery retailers to report strong revenue helped by market share gains, while it expects further demand recovery for alcoholic beverage companies.  Paints companies, too, indicated brokerages, are expected to report revenue growth as a result of price hikes. Margins, however, will continue to be stressed given the high inflation in crude oil derivatives.  Battered by inflation for several quarters now, FMCG companies were hopeful that a declining trend would start with the closing of FY22 and that pressure would finally ease off in the second half. However, the Russia-Ukraine war, which has triggered a price rise in several key commodities, has dashed these hopes.  Companies such as Marico and Godrej Consumer Products reported a decline in FMCG volumes due to the weak demand scenario.  “During the quarter, consumption trends remained subdued amidst weak rural sentiment and inflation in global commodities aggravating due to geopolitical tensions. While companies effected price hikes across FMCG categories to cope with the cost push, persistent inflation continued to hurt consumer wallets across rural and urban. As a result, FMCG volumes declined in the January-February 2022 period on a year-on-year basis as per Nielsen,” said Marico in its quarterly update.  The company reported low single-digit revenue growth in the quarter, while volumes were marginally positive on an exceptionally high base (25 percent), leading to a double-digit volume growth on a two-year CAGR basis.  Godrej Consumer said it expects to deliver a higher than mid-single-digit sales growth and a two-year CAGR around mid-teens.  “On the profitability front, we expect lower year-on-year EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margins during the quarter. This is due to input inflation and our weak performance in Indonesia,” it added.  The third quarter of the fiscal 2022 had also seen a decline in volumes for several FMCG companies. Companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Godrej Consumer Products, Emami and Marico registered low to flat volume growth as demand for their products declined. HUL reported volume growth of 2 percent in the quarter ended December compared with 4 percent growth in the second quarter.  According to Jefferies, HUL is likely to see 1 percent volume decline, 8 percent revenue growth and a y-o-y margin contraction.  “ITC cigarette Ebit should grow 10 percent, with volume up 9 percent. Britannia, Colgate, Marico and Emami would likely see muted 0-3 percent volume growth, with y-o-y margin decline and weak Ebitda growth,” it said.  Dabur, said the brokerage, is likely to see pressure in health and personal care and healthcare, partly offset by foods. “Margin pressure could dent Nestle's Ebitda, despite good volume growth,” it added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/fmcg-q4-preview-staples-set-to-report-another-disappointing-quarter-8360731.html,1,1.0

The Nifty Midcap index gained 3.6 percent and the Smallcap index rose 2.7 percent during the week, while the Nifty50 gained 0.6 percent to close at 17,784.  The good part was that the Nifty50 managed to hold on to the 17,600 mark, which experts feel can act as an immediate crucial support, with resistance remaining at 18,100, the recent highs touched by the market. Breaking on either side could give firm direction to the market in coming days, experts said. The index also strongly held above 50 DMA (17,140), 100 DMA (17,307) and 200 DMA (17,131).  &quot;In the coming week, 17,600 followed by 17,400 are likely to provide some cushion for the index and till the time, we do not close below these key levels, we would continue with our 'buy on decline' strategy,&quot; Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.  On the flipside, he said, the first sign of strength would be visible after surpassing the 17,900 mark.  This week is likely to be truncated and hence, do not expect any big-bang move in key indices, he feels. &quot;The upside as of now looks limited for the week towards 18,000–18,100. But the way broader market kept buzzing in the challenging phase last week as well, one must continue to focus outside the index.&quot;  The market will remain shut on April 14 for Mahavir Jayanti and Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti, and April 15 for Good Friday.  Here are the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on April 8 closing prices:  Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities  Equitas Holdings: Buy | LTP: Rs 119.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 111 | Target: Rs 132 | Return: 10.5 percent  After showing rangebound action in the last one month, the stock price has moved up sharply in last week. Currently, the stock price has made an attempt of upside breakout of down sloping trend line around Rs 119-120 levels. Hence, a sustainable move above this area could open sharp upside ahead.  The larger degree of higher tops and bottoms is intact as per weekly timeframe chart and the stock price has formed a recent higher bottom at Rs 100 levels. Volume and weekly 14 period RSI (relative strength index) indicates further strengthening of upside momentum for the stock price ahead.  Buying can be initiated in Equitas at current market price), add more on dips down to Rs 114, and wait for the upside target of Rs 132 in the next 3-4 weeks. One can place a stop-loss of Rs 111.    National Fertilizers: Buy | LTP: Rs 60.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 56 | Target: Rs 67.50 | Return: 11.4 percent  The below weekly timeframe chart of National Fertilizers indicates an excellent up-move over the last few weeks. The stock price has witnessed an upside breakout of the crucial resistance of down sloping trend line at Rs 59 and moved up in last week.  The present stock movement could be considered as a crucial upside breakout of an uptrend and a sharp up-move is likely to continue for the near term.  Volume has started to expand during upside breakout in the stock price and weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication. Hence, one may expect further strengthening of upside momentum in the stock price ahead.  One may look to buy NFL at current market price, add more on dips down to Rs 58 and wait for the upside target of Rs 67.50 in the next 3-4 weeks, while placing stop-loss at Rs 56.    Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 106.50 | Stop-Loss: Rs 99.50 | Target: Rs 118 | Return: 10.8 percent  The below weekly timeframe chart of Bombay Dyeing indicates rangebound action over the last 5-6 weeks after a sharp decline of February month. The stock price is currently making an attempt to stage upside breakout of the range movement at Rs 106-107 levels. Hence a sustainable move above this area could open a sharp up-move for the stock price ahead.  The larger degree of positive sequence like higher tops and bottoms is intact and the stock price is now moving up after the formation of new higher bottom. Volume pattern and weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication for the stock price ahead.  One may look to buy Bombay Dyeing at current market price, add more on dips down to Rs 102.50 and wait for the upside target of Rs 118 in the next 3-4 weeks, while placing a stop-loss of Rs 99.50.    Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 741.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 680 | Target: Rs 850-900 | Return: 14.6-21.3 percent  The stock is forming a series of higher tops and higher bottoms, which is extremely positive. The stock has again surpassed its previous highs last week with the decisive dismissal. Such a pattern helps the stock to move into a new bullish segment.  The Rs 680 level will be a great support for the stock and as long as the stock is trading above it, the chances of reaching Rs 850 or Rs 900 will be bright.  The strategy should be to buy at Rs 750 and add more at Rs 710. Place the last stop-loss at Rs 680.    UPL: Buy | LTP: Rs 809.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 780 | Target: Rs 865-900 | Return: 7-11 percent  The stock is forming a V shaped recovery pattern, which indicates a sudden development in the stock, which may lift the stock above its previous highs. This is in contrast to the construction of a circular plane.  The rounding bottom formation enables the stock to make a gradual upward move, while the V-shaped recovery helps the stock to make a rapid upward move.  The stock is a buy at current levels with a stop-loss at Rs 780. At higher levels, resistance would be at Rs 865 and Rs 950 in the coming weeks.    Expert: Pushkaraj Sham Kanitkar, VP Equities at GEPL Capital  ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 267.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 242 | Target: Rs 325 | Return: 21 percent  ITC last week traded at a 52-week high. In the process it has broken out of six-month consolidation pattern spanning around a quadrilateral pattern. The daily chart shows that the prices have a tendency to move up in staggered manner since the panic lows of March 2020.  The first leg of consolidation saw it traded between Rs 160 and Rs 210 during August to December 2020. The next leg saw it consolidated between Rs 200-225. The current leg has traversed between Rs 210 and Rs 260.  The long-term moving averages are positively aligned with 50 DMA (daily moving average Rs 234.50) trading above the 100 as well as the 200 DMA (Rs 224), while the 100 DMA (Rs 228.5) is also in turn trading above the 200 DMA (224).  On the weekly charts, one can see a space in chart for up-move till Rs 325 (2018's high). The extrapolated price patterns target to indicate an up-move till around Rs 315-320 (Height of the quadrilateral).  The above view will get negated only if the momentum is lost and prices trade below the median at Rs 242 on a closing basis.    Bharti Airtel: Buy | LTP: Rs 762 | Stop-Loss: Rs 742 | Target: Rs 900 | Return: 18 percent  Bharti Airtel last week traded at a 52-week as well as an all-time high. In the process it has broken out of 6-month long consolidation pattern spanning around a W-shaped pattern. The daily chart shows that the prices have earlier too shown a tendency to move up in staggered manner. The W pattern may also be envisaged as a part of 'flag and pole', which can culminate successfully if prices cross above Rs 785.  The long-term moving averages are positively aligned with 50 DMA (Rs 714.85) trading above the 100 as well as the 200 DMA, while the 100 DMA (Rs 710.90) is also in turn trading above the 200 DMA (Rs 673.13). The latest cross over is part of parallel move of the 50-100 DMA encompassing over last 3 months, including the zigzags intermittently.  The extrapolated levels in contention would be Rs 900 mark, approximately the depth of W pattern after a breakout above the level of Rs 785. The above view will get negated only if the momentum is lost and prices trade below the median at Rs 742 on a closing basis.    Voltas: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,317.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,220 | Target: Rs 1,581 | Return: 20 percent  Voltas last week traded at a 52-week as well as an all-time high. In the process it is close to breaking out of 6-month long consolidation pattern spanning around a 'Rectangle' pattern.  Similar pattern spanned between February &amp;amp; September 2021, which was then followed by up-move till Rs 1,351 in October 2021.  The long-term moving averages are positively aligned with 50 DMA (Rs 1,231) trading above the 100 as well as the 200 DMA, while the 100 DMA (Rs 1,227) is also in turn trading above the 200 DMA (Rs 1,175). The latest cross over is part of parallel move of the 50-100 DMA encompassing over last 3 months, including the zig zags intermittently.  The extrapolated levels in contention would be Rs 1,581 mark, approximately the depth of rectangle pattern after a breakout above the level of Rs 1,351.  The above view will get negated only if the momentum is lost and prices trade below the convergence of 50-100 DMA at Rs 1,220.    Expert: Astha Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Hem Securities  Bharat Electronics: Buy | LTP: Rs 240 | Stop-Loss: Rs 207 | Target: Rs 260-280 | Return: 8.5-17 percent  On weekly charts, price action shows that after consolidating for 5-6 months, the stock has given strong breakout which signals further upside in stock.  Also MACD (moving average convergence divergence) crossed above its signal line which qualifies bullish trend in stock. Hence we recommend buy with stop-loss of Rs 207 and possible price targets of Rs 260-280.    Havells India: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,268 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,170 | Target: Rs 1,425 | Return: 12.4 percent  On weekly charts, the stock has closed above its all-important moving averages. Also, on volume front, the stock has seen one of highest volumes since December 2021.  Last Friday, the stock has been successfully closed above its major resistance zone of Rs 1,200-1,250 which indicates strength in stock.  Hence we recommend buy with stop-loss of Rs 1,170 and possible price target of Rs 1,425.

Hotels and resorts in popular tourist hotspots like Delhi, Mumbai, Panaji, Kochi, Srinagar, Shimla, Nainital, and Dehradun have even seen advance booking rates climb to above pre-pandemic levels.  “What we are experiencing in the last four to six weeks is a strong revival. I can definitely speak for IHCL that our March, April, and May (2022) business on the books is higher than in March, April, and May of 2019,” Managing Director &amp;amp; CEO of Indian Hotels Puneet Chhatwal, said.  Similarly, Vikramjit Singh, President, Lemon Tree Hotels, said with the way advance bookings are pouring in for April and May he expects bookings to rise beyond pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter of 2022-23.  Vibhas Prasad, Director of Leisure Hotels Group, added that their hotels and resorts are seeing robust demand across all destinations.  Online travel agencies (OTAs) have also seen a rise in bookings and searches for hotels across India. Data from Yatra.com show that bookings for hotels in Goa, Kerala, Puducherry, Rishikesh, Shimla, Nainital, and Dehradun have risen nearly 100 percent compared to March.  Furthermore, search queries for hotels have risen by nearly 250 percent in the first week of April compared to March.  “Leisure travel demand continues to lead recovery, and we are hoping for a promising travel season as summer begins. Goa, Srinagar, Rishikesh, and Mussoorie are some of the destinations that people are currently searching and booking hotel reservations in,” a spokesperson for MakeMyTrip said.  Price hikes  Encouraged by the rising demand, hotel chains have also increased prices across popular destinations. Data collected from OTAs show that the average room rates for metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata, have risen by up to 40 percent.  “Most major hotel chains in India had hiked prices of their rooms by around 5-10 percent on year in February. These rates have risen around 30 percent for April and May,” an official from Yatra.com said.  He added that some popular tourist destinations like Shimla, Goa, and Nainital are even seeing price hikes of 100-150 percent year-on-year.  Pradeep Shetty, Joint Secretary, Federation of Hotel &amp;amp; Restaurant Associations of India, said that currently, hotels at tourist destinations are seeing a spike in bookings, resulting in a rise in average room rates across the country.  “Rates in top business hotels in Mumbai have gone up by close to 50 percent over the past two weeks. Hotel rates in leisure locations are about 2x or 3x of 2019 rates,” an official from ITC said.  The rise in hotel bookings is also due to customers willing to spend more on travel, officials said.  Furthermore, the wedding season in parts of North India, which was interrupted in January and February due to the outbreak of the third wave of COVID-19, is back on the rise.  “There is a lot of bounce-back on weddings; April, May, June, July have a number of auspicious dates,” Ajay Bakaya, Managing Director of Sarovar Hotels, said.  International tourists  While there is a surge in bookings from domestic travelers across India for the upcoming summer, the inflow of international tourists has still been slow.  “A rise in cases in China, coupled with geopolitical tensions across Europe has led to a slower inflow of international tourists than was expected when international flights open up,” a senior official from a large hotel chain said.  He added that the industry was expecting at least a 50 percent rise in international bookings for the upcoming summer period once international flights restart, but till now the rise in international bookings has been slow.  Similarly, data from OTAs show that while queries from international tourists for popular tourist destinations have been on the rise, a large number of these queries have not translated into bookings.  “Travel queries have risen by nearly 70 percent from international tourists, but bookings have risen only 15 percent in the first week of April compared to March,” the official from Yatra.com said.  Hotel chains across India are also seeing international tourists accounting for only 5-10 percent of their advance bookings.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/summer-of-22-april-may-advance-bookings-at-hotels-rise-up-to-60-chains-raise-room-rates-by-25-8336541.html,0,0.0
ITC,2022-04-07T14:58:29+05:30,2022-04-07,Moneycontrol News,"Hindustan Unilever underperforms ITC on fears of slowdown, rising input prices will hurt earnings","ITC has surged over 20% so far in 2022, while Hindustan Unilever has dropped 8%. Analysts say a slowdown in rural consumption and higher raw material prices will affect the consumer goods company’s profitability.","Shares of ITC have outperformed those of Hindustan Unilever so far this year amid margin pressure for the fast-moving consumer goods company due to hardening crude oil prices.  ITC has surged over 20 percent year to date, while Hindustan Unilever shares have dropped 8 percent. The benchmark Sensex and Nifty 50 have gained 1.5 percent each, while the BSE FMCG index rose 1 percent.  The subdued performance of Hindustan Unilever shares can be largely attributed to a slowdown in the rural market, resulting in a moderation of sales volumes since the third quarter of FY22 and higher input costs affecting profitability over the past two quarters, analysts said.  According to brokerage Sharekhan, domestic consumers are switching to low-price units and cutting discretionary spending due to a sustained slowdown in the rural markets and a high inflationary environment. It expects Hindustan Unilever’s sales volumes to decline in the fourth quarter from a year ago. However, India’s largest consumer goods company increased prices across its product portfolio and that may result in low-to-mid-single digit revenue growth during the quarter.  Hindustan Unilever executives had indicated earlier that higher costs of inputs such as crude oil and palm oil would increase pressure on gross margins in the fourth quarter. Price increases of 2-13 percent across the product portfolio, along with an 8 percent increase in Q3, would help in mitigating a rise in input costs in Q4.  War impact  However, a sharp increase in commodity prices following the Russia-Ukraine war and supply disruption would lead to operating profit margins declining in the first quarter of FY23, Sharekhan said. It expects a sharp decline in margins in the first half of FY23, which might improve only in the second half if commodity prices ease.  Nielsen data suggests a high-single digit volume decline and flattish value for Hindustan Unilever in both urban and rural India, with the rural market more impacted. Among all product categories, beauty (skin and hair care) would be impacted more, while laundry and nutrition sales would also be affected.  Prices of palm oil and its derivatives, which are used in Hindustan Unilever’s skin cleansing and hair care categories, have been climbing. So have prices of crude oil and its derivatives, which are key inputs for its laundry and household care products.  Inflation hedge  ITC is the least affected by the rural slowdown because its portfolio comprises mainly foods, analysts said. The company offers the best inflation hedge as its core business is completely immune to inflation risk. With volume growth back in the cigarette market and tailwinds elsewhere, ITC may offer earnings surprises in FY23, the analysts added.  ITC is one of the largest consumer companies in India, with businesses spanning categories such as cigarettes, hotels, paper and agri-commodities. Its branded foods division, with products such as staples, confectionery, noodles, snacks and biscuits, is performing well and gaining strong market share across many categories.  “We expect the volume in cigarettes to revive at a CAGR of 5% during FY22–24E as against a CAGR of -1% during FY11–21; FMCG’s EBITDA margin to scale up to higher single digits; and the hotel, paperboard and agri-commodities businesses to revive. This will lead to an earnings CAGR of 12% in FY22–24E against a mere 7% in the last five years,” Edelweiss Wealth Research said in a note.  The brokerage has set a target price of Rs 450 for ITC shares, which is up 80 percent from the current market price.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hindustan-unilever-underperforms-itc-on-fears-of-slowdown-rising-input-prices-will-hurt-earnings-8328521.html,1,1.0
ITC,2022-04-02T08:46:10+05:30,2022-04-02,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"Daily Voice | Strategy in ITC, Reliance Industries scrips, as explained by Mohit Nigam of Hem Securities","Quarter 4 result season is around the corner and, we believe there will be shrinkage in margins due to rising input cost caused by rising geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine. ","&quot;We believe ITC can be picked up by long-term investors despite the fact that it has run up quite a bit,&quot; says Mohit Nigam, Head of PMS at Hem Securities. ITC shares gained 17 percent in March, the most in sixteen months.  The company is relatively insulated as it has other verticals such as hotels and cigarettes, which cushion the blow to its FMCG segment from the sharp rise in input costs, he says.  In case of Reliance Industries, which hit Rs 18 lakh crore in market capitalisation, he says historically, the stock has managed to deliver returns at the CAGR of 30 percent since FY18 and is expected to continue the similar upward journey in FY23 too.  FY22 ended on a strong note with around 20 percent gains. Do you think considering the current headwinds including commodity inflation and earnings worries, the market can deliver similar kind of returns in FY23?  Markets are bound to rise, the previous peaks will be surpassed by higher highs. Commodity inflation, geopolitical crisis, earnings headwinds are all temporary, one should look at the broader picture. The ongoing reforms in the nation, imposition of technology, promotion of Made in India PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme, increase in exports, China plus 1 strategy and other incentives are some of the key factors that will drive the markets ahead.

However, the degree and time in which these reforms and policies will be successful will decide the time for the market to bounce again. All in all India is working towards improving the environment for investors which will be a key driver for its growth strategy.  Monetary Policy Committee will hold its first policy meet for FY23. Do you think the Reserve Bank of India and governor commentary will give a hint about rate hikes given the expected inflation concerns or will the RBI prefer to stay behind the curve and focus on growth? Do you expect any rate hikes in FY23?  In this time of conflict, the central bank's monetary policy meeting in April will encounter a number of obstacles, including rising prices and the likelihood of a GDP slowdown. We expected a rate hike at the policy meeting, but now expect it to be postponed due to growing geopolitical worries over Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its impact on commodity prices.  The RBI has remained at a stalemate on interest rates for a long time, and at its most recent policy meeting, it decided against a widely expected rate hike to spur growth. Governor Shaktikanta Das is in charge of keeping inflation under control but also protecting the country's still-fragile economy. As a result, rate rises by the RBI are more likely to be delayed until later this year.  Also read - GST collections hit record high of Rs 1.42 lakh crore in March  ITC has run up a lot in the last one month. What are the major reasons behind the same and what is your call on the stock? Is it looking expensive now?  Shares of ITC surged nearly 17 percent in March, the most in sixteen months, even as its peers dropped on fears of margin pressure due to input cost inflation. The scrip has been going up when the entire market was coming down due to various reasons. Firstly, with the rise in tobacco volumes and the excise duty which has been kept unchanged in the Union Budget for FY23 has done well for the steady rise in volumes of both cigarettes and tobacco. Secondly, the hotels business is definitely showing a positive momentum with the lifting of most Covid restrictions post the third-wave that has led to an increase in mobility and therefore augurs well for ITC's hotel business. RIL has managed to deliver returns at the CAGR of 30 percent since FY18 Apart from this, it does have a paper business which is likely to do well in the backdrop of tight paper supplies in the domestic market and a possible surge in paper exports. So all this does point well for ITC and we believe it can be picked up by long-term investors despite the fact that it has run up quite a bit. The company is relatively insulated as it has other verticals such as hotels and cigarettes, which cushion the blow to its FMCG segment from the sharp rise in input costs.

Also what is your allocation to largecap, midcap and smallcap in the equity space?  We all know that asset allocation is the key in any portfolio. An investor can allocate its portfolio in debt, equity, gold, real estate etc. based on the investor's risk-return profile, horizon and investment objective. Equity leads to growth in your wealth over the long term, and debt lends stability in the portfolio as well as growth in wealth i.e. investors who prefer relatively higher returns are heavy on equity and those who prefer relative stability are more into debt investments.  An investor can allocate its fund in the pattern: 65 percent to equity, 20 percent to debt and 15 percent to gold. FY23 can be a good year for equities and investors can allocate their major chunks in equities and among equities approximately 50 percent should be invested in Large cap, 30 percent should be in Mid Cap and remaining should be in small cap for multibagger returns.

How do you approach the stock and will it give similar kind of returns by end of FY23 too?  Reliance Industries, the largest Indian company by market capitalisation, has given decent correction after hitting Rs 18 lakh crore mark. The stock managed to end the FY22 near life highs after a strong breakout in the month of March. The stock seems to be getting ready for the next rally as fundamentally the company has never been stronger.  After achieving the net debt mark ahead of the targeted timeline, the company is now focusing on reducing the funding cost and has raised the debt just before interest rates started rising globally primarily to refinance high-cost debt. The oil-to-retail conglomerate is expected to have an eventful FY23 with the upcoming 5G auction and is expected to perform well across all the business segments.  Historically, the stock has managed to deliver returns at the CAGR of 30 percent since FY18 and is expected to continue the similar upward journey in FY23 too.  Given the commodities prices are rising, and inflation is a big headwind, what is the impact on overall corporate earnings and also will the impact last for two or more quarters?  Quarter 4 result season is around the corner and, we believe there will be shrinkage in margins due to rising input cost caused by rising geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine. Petrol and diesel prices are continuously hiked thus, increasing logistics cost. Important raw materials like aluminium and copper have risen by 26 percent and 7 percent respectively in the last three months. Whereas, natural gas rose by 47 percent in the last three months. Going forward, we believe there might be some relief in input cost and some improvement in corporate earnings can be witnessed from Q1FY23.

The stock has been an underperformer for the past few years due to stagnant financials, ESG concerns and exposure to COVID.  Peers such as Godrej Consumer lost 8% in March, Nestle India dropped 3%, Hindustan Unilever declined 8%, Dabur India 7.6% while Marico fell 5.4%. Godrej Consumer, Nestle India and Hindustan Unilever have dropped for the third consecutive month while Dabur India declined for the fourth month. Marico fell for the fifth month.  Many FMCG stocks are under pressure due to an increase in input prices amid rising crude and global commodity rates and global supply chain disruption during COVID as well as the Russia-Ukraine war. The firms are also facing lower demand due to increased prices, said Vinit Bolinjkar, head of research, Ventura Securities.  However, analysts expect ITC to be least affected by the rural slowdown as its portfolio comprises mainly foods. The company offers the best inflation hedge as its core business is completely immune to inflation risk. With volume growth back in the cigarette market and tailwinds elsewhere, ITC may offer earnings surprises in FY23, analysts added.  ITC is one of the largest consumer companies in India, with businesses spanning categories such as cigarettes, hotels, paper and agri-commodities. Its branded foods division, with products such as staples, confectionery, noodles, snacks and biscuits, is performing well and gaining strong market share across many categories.  In the cigarette business, analysts say legal cigarette players gained market share from illegal players (almost one-fourth of the market), as no tax hike was announced for the second consecutive year.  ITC's agri commodity businesses are likely to benefit from wheat exports because of the Ukraine crisis. Analysts say Russia and Ukraine account for 30% of global exports if the Indian wheat crop is good, regulators have a conducive policy and India’s food inflation does not become a big challenge.  The firm's hotel sector is likely to see strong recovery in fiscal year 2023 after continued falling COVID cases and recently India started international flights. According to Omkar Mistry, analyst with Choice Broking, faster recovery in hotel business is expected given the vaccination drives and improving economic indicators.  ITC's paper business is likely to benefit after re-opening of offices, educational institutions and courts; this has led to regularisation of demand, sales volume coupled with higher realisation. This was despite a sharp increase in major input costs in the recent period, analysts added.  Although gross margins in ITC's FMCG sector are likely to remain under pressure, cost optimisation and price hikes will help. Considering these factors and a dividend yield of 4-5%, brokerage firm Edelweiss Securities has maintained a buy rating on the stock.  Of the 36 brokers tracking the ITC stock on Bloomberg, 27 have recommended a buy rating, seven have a hold on the stock and one has a sell rating.  &quot;We expect the volume in cigarettes to revive at a CAGR of 5% during FY22–24E as against a CAGR of -1% during FY11–21; FMCG’s EBITDA margin to scale up to higher single digits; and the hotel, paperboard and agri-commodities businesses to revive.

ITC,2022-03-09T15:07:26+05:30,2022-03-09,Devika Singh,FMCG companies turn to social media for new product development,"Companies such as ITC, Godrej Consumer Products and Tata Consumer Products are using insights drawn from social chatter and customer feedback on social media to launch new products and variants.","A few years ago a charcoal soap or an onion hair oil would typically be a product found on a new-age direct-to-consumer (D2C) company’s website. Now, these innovations can be found on the shelves of supermarkets and even daily kirana stores.  Thanks to digital and social media, FMCG companies have an ear to the ground and are constantly launching new products developed using insights and customer feedback from these platforms.  Take for instance, ITC, which launched frozen snacks and cooking pastes under the ITC Master Chef brand during the pandemic after identifying a consumer trend towards convenience foods. Godrej Consumer Products, similarly, introduced a charcoal soap under the Cinthol brand as it found customers searching for the product on its direct-to-consumer platform.  “Digital media and social media are powerful tools that help understand what consumers want, work on new products and develop them,” Somasree Bose Awasthi, Chief Marketing Officer (India), Godrej Consumer Products, told Moneycontrol.  A sound new product development (NPD) strategy, experts point out, is essential for the long-term growth of an FMCG company, especially in a market like India, where consumers are constantly looking for innovation.  “NPD traction is more than just a ‘few percentage points of extra growth (for a year)’. While the general perception is that the benefit of increased NPD traction is limited to a few percentage points of extra growth (for a year or so), we believe it is much more than that,” said a recent report by ICICI Securities.  “We believe the success of NPD is essential to provide longevity to an organization,” it added.  Social Listening  Several FMCG companies have roped in digital marketing companies for ‘social listening’, a way to draw insights from social networking platforms, while others have set up in-house teams for the purpose.  “ITC has set up a marketing command centre called Sixth Sense which delivers on multiple pillars encompassing insights, data, moment marketing, tracking social media metrics and even industry benchmarking,” said Shuvadip Banerjee, Chief Digital Marketing Officer, ITC Limited.  According to Banerjee, Sixth Sense helps the company understand conversations on social media platforms, which leads to the identification of key trends and, in turn, product development and packaging ideas.  “The traditional way to get feedback from customers is through customer trials and market research, which would take three-four months. But now, through digital and social media, consumer goods companies can get a more data points to build feedback into product design and in a more cost-effective way,” said Dipankar Maganty, Principal, Kearney.  Tata Consumer Products, too, has launched a slew of products after popular demand on social media. The company marked its entry into the premium coffee space last year by launching D2C brand Sonnets. While the range initially offered only French Press and coffee filter grinds, six months after the launch the company also introduced Moka Pot, given the consumer demand on social media.  “Over the last few months, several customers reached out to us via direct messages and comments, enquiring about whole bean coffee. Based on this feedback, we recently launched the whole beans range of Sonnets,” said Puneet Das, President – Packaged Beverages (India &amp;amp; South Asia), Tata Consumer Products.  The company also plans to soon launch a range of teas under the 1868 by Tata Tea brand, based on consumer feedback on social media.  “We also actively take polls on social media to understand consumer preferences. Polls are a quick and easy way to gauge consumer interest or get feedback in real-time. Actively listening to consumer conversations on social media has helped us keep our product assortment exciting and desirable,” said Das.  Taking on D2C  The emergence of digital-native brands, which are agile in launching products, has also made it imperative for FMCG companies to keep up with trends and launch innovative products.  Companies such as Marico, Emami and Bajaj Consumer Care have launched products such as onion hair oil and onion shampoos as they try to compete with D2C brands.  Players such as Dabur, Marico, Emami and Tata Consumer Products are launching products exclusively for their D2C platforms and marketplaces as they compete with digital-first brands. Dabur India, for instance, aims to clock Rs 100 crore in sales from its digital-native brands in FY23. Dabur plans to launch superfoods such as chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other healthy snacks under its Real Health brands on the e-commerce channel.  “If you look at our overall NPD-to-sales ratio in the quarter (Q3), it stood at 3.6 percent. However, in the e-commerce space it is around 10 percent. Hence, we are poised to exit at a rate of around Rs 100 crore from NPD in the e-commerce or digital space. We will end this year at around Rs 60-70 crore but next year we should be crossing around Rs 100 crore on the NPD of the digitally native brands,” Mohit Malhotra, CEO, Dabur, had said while addressing an investor call in February.  NPD-to-sales ratio determines what percentage of a company’s sales are being drawn from its new product launches.  However, this has also emerged as a way for companies to test-market their products on the masses via online channels. “Online offers you the opportunity to test market some of these niche products in a cost-efficient way,” said Dipankar Maganty of Kearney,” said Maganty of Kearney.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/fmcg-companies-turn-to-social-media-for-new-product-development-8211821.html,2,2.0

The Nifty50 fell 2.5 percent or 413 points to 16,245 during the week, the lowest closing level since August 6. The index has formed a bearish candle on the weekly scale and, considering the current war situation, the index falling below 16,000 amid current elevated volatility can be possible in the short term before getting bottomed out, but in case that happens then that would be great buying opportunity, experts feel.  &quot;Although such war scenarios are always tricky, we can clearly see a negative trend on the weekly time-frame charts,&quot; said Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One.  In addition, the falling slope of RSI-smoothened oscillator is an indication of further weakness. So, though the Nifty has reached the initial target of 16,200, we do not want to pre-empt a near-term bottom here, he says, adding 16,000–15,900 is to be seen as an immediate support, while on the higher side, 16,450, followed by 16,600, will be strong resistances.  &quot;Looking at the war situation, we will not be surprised to see the Nifty enter sub-16,000 terrain, but we do not expect the index to slip below 15,500–15,200, as of now,&quot; Chavan said.  From an investor's point of view, he feels this is certainly an excellent opportunity to bag quality stocks in a staggered manner but for traders, it will be difficult to say that worse is behind.  Here are the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on March 4 closing prices.  Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities  Hindalco Industries: Buy | LTP: 583.80 | Stop-Loss: Rs 550 | Target: Rs 660 | Return: 13 percent  The stock had spent a lot of time below the Rs 550 level. On the decisive break of Rs 550, the stock is set to move towards Rs 660 in the near future.  On Friday, the stock corrected at Rs 580 after hitting a high of Rs 619. As the trend is strong, we need to buy on each of the major support with a stop-loss at Rs 550.    Jindal Steel and Power: Buy | LTP: 435.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 420 | Target: Rs 470-500 | Return: 15 percent  The stock is forming a double bottom formation. Our view is that the stock is moving towards a low of Rs 470. It is available at Rs 435, which is the major support for the stock and if Rs 475 is decisively crossed then we can also see Rs 500 levels which was its previous level high.  In short, the stock is gaining momentum and the strategy should be to add long positions at each of the major support. To keep the long position safe, we need to place a tight stop-loss at Rs 420.    ACC: Sell | LTP: Rs 2,010.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,050 | Target: Rs 1,900-1,850 | Return: 8 percent  The stock has broken the key Rs 2,000 support, above which it has spent more than 9 months. This is a decisive breakdown.  The stock is trending lower according to the Directional Moving Index Oscillator (DMI), suggesting that we should have a seller at each resistance. The broad formation of the stock is between Rs 2,000 and Rs 1,975. Place a stop-loss at Rs 2,050.    Expert: Astha Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Hem Securities  Birlasoft: Buy | LTP: Rs 437.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 380 | Target: Rs 485-510 | Return: 16 percent  After making high of Rs 585 on January 10, 2022, the stock has fallen and touched the level of Rs 380 on February 24, 2022. Afterwards, the stock is continuously forming higher highs &amp;amp; higher lows in last few trading sessions &amp;amp; has successfully close above 10 &amp;amp; 20 EMA (exponential moving average).  Also, on daily charts, MACD (moving average convergence divergence) crosses above its signal line which qualifies bullish trend in stock while on weekly charts, a bullish Engulfing pattern is formed. Hence, we believe that stock is poised for upside rally with medium term target of Rs 510.    Tips Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,090.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,800 | Target: Rs 2,450-2,610 | Return: 25 percent  On daily chart, MACD crosses above its signal line which qualifies bullish trend in stock while on weekly chart, stock has formed strong base at around Rs 1,800 level.  Any sustainable close above Rs 2,270 will bring further strength in stock and lead the price movement upwards towards Rs 2,450-2,600 level. Hence, we believe that stock is medium term buy opportunity with possible price targets of Rs 2,450-2,610.    Expert: Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities  Wipro: Buy | LTP: Rs 575.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 555 | Target: Rs 610 | Return: 6 percent  The stock has surpassed the crucial resistance of its 20-day EMA. There has been series of positive divergences registered on the daily RSI oscillator, which shows the accumulation in the stock.  Other indicators like daily MACD has also been trading above its equilibrium line. IT sector has been showing strength in the current scenario and depreciating rupee against dollar could also help the sector to outperform.    Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,711.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,765 | Target: Rs 1,625 | Return: 5 percent  The stock has been forming lower tops and lower bottoms on the daily charts. Stock has breached crucial support of its 200-day EMA. Indicators and oscillators like RSI, MACD and DMI (directional movement index) have turned bearish on the short term charts.  Indicators and oscillators have been indicating bearish trend for the medium term. Stock price has broken down below 5-day of consolidation along with rising volumes.    Shriram Transport Finance: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,089.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,125 | Target: Rs 1,010 | Return: 7 percent  After a big bearish candle on February 24, 2022, the stock went in to consolidation phase for next four trading sessions.  Considering the primary trend, stock is on the verge of breaking below the recent swing low, which will result in to breakdown from the consolidation. Stock has been trading below is important moving averages.    Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com  Bajaj Finance: Sell | LTP: Rs 6,537.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,725 | Target: Rs 6,300 | Return: 4 percent  Recently, the stock has consolidated in a range above its '200-DMA. However, towards the end of the week the prices gave a breakdown below the support with a gap down. The 'RSI' oscillator is indicating a weak momentum while the short term moving average is below the medium term indicating a short term downtrend. We expect further correction in the stock in the short term and hence, short term traders should look to sell the stock on any pullback move.  Hence, short term traders can look for shorting opportunities in the range of Rs 6,570-6,590 with a stop-loss placed above Rs 6,725 for potential short term targets of Rs 6,300. (The given levels are of cash segment which can be used as reference to trade in futures segment)    ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 225.50 | Stop-Loss: Rs 210 | Target: Rs 242-250 | Return: 11 percent  While the stock did not participate in the recent market uptrend, it is now witnessing buying interest in such an uncertain environment due to its low volatility. The prices up move during the week have been supported by rising volumes while the momentum oscillators are indicating positive traction. Prices have given a breakout above its 'Bollinger Bands’ which are rising now and hence, we expect a positive trend in the stock in the near term.  Hence, traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy the stock in the range of Rs 225-220 for potential targets of Rs 242 and Rs 250 in the near term. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 210 on long positions.

ITC,2022-01-27T11:48:22+05:30,2022-01-27,Shantanu Guha Ray, EXCLUSIVE: Digital and sustainability are mega trends that will shape the post-pandemic future: ITC...,"Market forces willing, Puri claimed, ITC is keen to invest Rs 10,000 crore over the next three years for acquisitions in the FMCG and IT business","ITC Chairman Sanjiv Puri is not averse to the idea of demerger of the conglomerate’s fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) business. Puri is also open to the idea of listing the company’s information technology (IT) businesses — ITC Infotech — as long as it creates sustained value for shareholders.  In a detailed interview, Puri said the company has also not shelved demerger plans for the hotel business. But he wants the market to recover. Puri made it clear that ITC has enough cash for investments but everything will depend on how market forces change over the next few years. Excerpts:  Let’s talk about the key tenets of the “ITC Next Strategy”. What’s in store?  The ‘ITC Next’ strategy focuses on the structural drivers that will power the company’s next horizon of growth and ensure that the enterprise remains future-oriented, consumer-centric and agile. New vectors of growth have been identified for each business to drive scale and profitability.  The key tenets of ‘ITC Next’ include leveraging ITC’s institutional synergies and power brands, a future-ready portfolio to create strong growth platforms, purposeful and agile science-based innovation, and accelerated investments in digital and sustainability. We will also be exploring additional opportunities for growth through value accretive M&amp;amp;As as well as enhanced investments to drive exports. A strategy reset over the last 3-4 years has led to structural interventions to drive margin expansion and capital productivity. Recognising digital and sustainability as two mega trends, ITC will explore disruptive business models at the intersection of Digital and Sustainability Recognising digital and sustainability as two mega trends that will shape the post-pandemic future, ITC will continue to explore opportunities to craft disruptive business models anchored at the intersection of Digital and Sustainability, leveraging its institutional strengths. We have already articulated a bold and ambitious Sustainability 2.0 Vision to build further on our exemplary ESG performance. The strategy of the organisation has been redefined to build integrated and empowered teams driven by a spirit of professional entrepreneurship — ‘Proneurs’ — that is aimed at sharpening consumer centricity, agility and focus.  How is your FMCG business shaping up? You must have drawn up a plan to drive margin expansion?   ITC has been one of the largest incubators of FMCG brands in India. We have built a portfolio of 25 mother brands that today have a consumer spend of over Rs 22,000 crore. Over the last four years, our revenue from the FMCG business has increased from Rs 10,500 to Rs 15,000 crore with several of ITC’s FMCG brands having already achieved leadership positions.  In the last four years, margins have gone up by 640 basis points through strategic interventions that include product-mix enrichment, bringing in back-end efficiencies, increasing focus on value-added segments and leveraging digital. Sharp-targeted structural interventions encompassing smart sourcing, development of an agile supply chain and robust capacity utilisation through a distributed manufacturing footprint have led to superior back-end efficiencies. The FMCG portfolio has been revitalised to make it future ready, address emerging trends and develop categories of the future The FMCG portfolio has been revitalised to make it future-ready, address emerging trends and develop categories of the future. Business segments that were incongruent to our growth aspirations have been shrunk. Investments have been made to enable agile and purposeful innovation through identified R&amp;amp;D platforms to power our brands. Besides deepening and widening reach, new routes to market have also been developed, which include strategic partnerships like Amway, a climate controlled supply chain, and scaling up foods services, among others.  ITC has also strengthened its direct-to consumer platform, the ITC e-store, which showcases the wide array in the company’s product portfolio under one roof, besides enabling trend spotting and gaining consumer insights.  So will there be more acquisitions in the FMCG space?   ITC will continue to evaluate value-accretive and synergistic inorganic opportunities as an additional pillar of growth. Acquisitions are guided by considerations such as strategic fit, valuation, financial viability and ease of integration. In recent times, the company has acquired brands such as ‘Savlon’, ‘Nimyle’ and ‘Charmis’ to strengthen its presence in the Personal Care Products Business.  In July 2020, the Company acquired 100 percent of the equity share capital of M/s Sunrise Foods Private Limited (Sunrise), an Indian company primarily engaged in the business of spices. Savlon has grown 14-fold and Nimyle has also grown 5 times since acquisition. ITC will continue to evaluate value accretive and synergistic inorganic opportunities as an additional pillar of growth So what are the focus categories for ITC, and in which areas will you lower focus?  We have identified FMCG segments where there is tremendous headroom to grow given low penetration by branded players. Experts have estimated that the overall addressable market segment for our FMCG portfolio would be about Rs 5 lakh crore by 2035. A multi-pronged approach has been adopted to revitalise the company’s FMCG portfolio. First by fortifying and scaling up our megabrands like Aashirvaad, Sunfeast and others. Secondly by addressing adjacencies through brand extensions, and thirdly by incubating new categories.  The choice of category is guided by its growth prospects, profitability profile and the ability of the company to effectively leverage its institutional strengths with a view to achieving leadership status within a reasonable time-frame. For example, Aashirvaad has emerged as a strong centre-of-plate brand, straddling many value-added categories, including multigrain atta, Superfoods range with multi-millet mix, ragi flour, gluten-free flour, organic atta, vermicelli, ready-to-cook options like poha, upma, suji halwa and so on.  Recognising the undercurrents of hygiene and naturals, our Personal Care Products Business has successfully expanded its portfolio under the ‘Savlon’ and ‘Nimyle’ brands. To address evolving consumer preferences for guilt-free snacking, ITC has launched a delectable range of frozen snacks under the ITC Master Chef brand. A number of new categories have been incubated, including chocolates, coffee, beverages and dairy, among others. The strategy in building such new categories of the future is to first validate the concept and business model in select beachheads and then progressively scale up these segments, creating new vectors of growth for the future.  As I have mentioned earlier, business segments such as LifeStyle Retailing, which are incongruent to our growth plans, have been shrunk. Overall addressable market segment for our FMCG portfolio would be about Rs 5 lakh crore by 2035 FMCG e-commerce contributed to 8 percent of sales in the June quarter. Can this increase? If yes, how? What’s happening on the digital front—on b2b and b2c e-commerce, and digital marketing?   Recognising the rapid pace and evolution of technology in India, ITC is investing in cutting-edge digital technologies to shape a new paradigm of competitiveness, create innovative business models and leverage newer opportunities. ITC’s digital transformation is being built on a foundation of an agile ‘Digital First’ culture. Accelerated digitalisation is being pursued across the entire value-chain with significant focus on digital marketing, digital commerce, digital products and digital operations.  ITC has, over the last few years, strengthened its engagements in e-commerce. ITC also revamped its direct-to-consumer platform, ‘ITC e-Store’, reaching consumers in 15 metros. The ITC e-Store, currently comprising 800 products across 45+ categories, provides a single platform to showcase the wide array of ITC’s product portfolio. Powered by its ‘Sixth Sense’ Marketing Command Centre, ITC is ahead of the curve in digital marketing with focus on three core pillars, including content, commerce and community.  The company has leveraged relevant technology and digital platforms to deliver meaningful impact in consumer engagement and experience, product development and process efficiencies. ITC is also progressively introducing more ‘digital first’ brands such as Dermafique’ and ‘Fiama’ to leverage the growing e-commerce space. ITC’s digital platforms like the Mangaldeep App, with over 1 million downloads, as well as the first-of-its-kind ‘digital puja’ initiative during the pandemic have also received immense appreciation.  In addition, Classmateshop.com offers mass personalisation of notebook covers as a first-to-market digital initiative. To ensure last-mile connectivity for all our distributors and uninterrupted supply of products to consumers, we have also developed apps like UNNATI (eB2B App) and VIRU (Virtual Salesman App), which facilitate digital ordering and end-to-end trade engagements. ITC is also progressively introducing more ‘digital first’ brands such as Dermafique’ and ‘Fiama’ to leverage the growing ecommerce space The pandemic wrecked India’s hospitality business. Has the situation changed for ITC? How would you cope with the changed situation? What is your strategy to address the issue of capital allocation?  The hospitality business, which was significantly impacted by the pandemic, had begun to witness a recovery. However, fresh restrictions following the new wave may cause further disruptions in the short term. For accelerated growth, we have adopted an asset right approach for the hospitality business wherein a large part of incremental room additions is expected to accrue through management contracts.  We have also renovated the Welcomhotel brand, and this portfolio of owned and managed properties will move up to 25 by the end of this year. The Business has also launched two new brands — ‘Storii’ for curated nature-based experiences and ‘Mementos’ which is a collection of unique luxury hotels across varied destinations. Already, four MOUs have been signed under the Storii brand and thee properties have been onboarded under Mementos.  Responding to the challenges and disruptions arising out of the pandemic, our Hotels Business has launched a host of curated offerings that will leverage and sweat existing assets besides augmenting new revenue streams. These include the introduction of innovative staycation packages and in-home dining offerings such as ‘Gourmet Couch’ and ‘Flavours’. Recently, the Business also piloted a signature ‘Sleeep Boutique’, leveraging extensive research to ensure superior experiences to discerning guests in this crucial area.  The business continues to leverage digital investments towards facilitating guest acquisition, enhancing the guest experience, augmenting revenue generation and driving operational efficiency.  What are the new levers of growth for your agri business?   ITC, as you are aware, has a large footprint in the Indian agricultural space. Our deep engagement in the agricultural sector through the ITC e-Choupal, has led to the empowerment of over 4 million farmers. As part of the ITC Next strategy, ITC is pursuing accelerated value addition anchored on NextGeneration Agriculture to build yet another pillar of growth. The objective is to foster demand-responsive value chains, promote climate-smart agriculture and digitally empower farmers.  ITC is working with farmers to develop robust models for value-added segments, such as food-safe IPM Chillies, organic mango pulp traceable to farms, specialty coffee certified for fair trade, end-use-specific wheat flours, medicinal and aromatic plant extracts and so on. Going forward, the company proposes to foster inclusive agri value-chains through nearly 4,000 FPOs, benefiting around 10 million farmers across multiple crop clusters. For accelerated growth, we have adopted an asset right approach for hospitality, where incremental room additions is expected to accrue through contracts To bring the power of cutting-edge digital technologies to farmers, ITC will launch a Super App during the year, called ITC-MAARS — Metamarket for Advanced Agriculture and Rural Services. Accordingly, a new vertical has been created in the business. ITC-MAARS will offer a full complement of agricultural solutions while its micro-services structure will enable plug-ins by a range of agtech solutions.  This will be delivered through a robust ‘phygital’ ecosystem. Some pilots at scale on an integrated chilli value-chain initiated in Andhra Pradesh have validated the concept and benefited farmers with an additional income of 26 percent in the ongoing season.  ITC Infotech seems to have delivered a strong performance over the last couple of years. What are your strategic areas of focus for this business?   We remain deeply committed to this business. The recent disruptions in digital technologies lend immense opportunities for agile players like ITC Infotech that possess domain-centric depth and capabilities. Living by its credo of offering business-friendly solutions, sharper focus is being provided in its chosen areas of specialisation such as Automation, Cloud-based Services, Digital Banking, Smart Manufacturing and Digital Workplace among others. The pillars of operational excellence and customer centricity have  led to an encouraging performance with the EBITDA margin growing from 8 percent to 25.2 percent from FY19 to FY21.  Can you elaborate on your plans for the Paperboards business? Is it easy to drive revenue and profitability?  Our Paperboards business has made significant progress in recent years with strategic investments in areas such as pulp import substitution, proactive capacity augmentation in the Value Added Paperboards segment where ITC is a distinct leader, as well as in decarbonisation of operations. As part of the ITC Next horizon, the focus is on three key vectors — value-added paperboards, where we are a distinct market leader, cutting-edge innovation in sustainable packaging to substitute single-use plastics, and investment in digital technologies like Industry 4.0, AI, ML and advanced analytics to drive process and operational efficiencies.  In sustainable packaging, the business has introduced an innovative portfolio comprising recyclable paperboards under the ‘FiloPack’ and ‘FiloServe’ series and biodegradable paperboards in the ‘OmegaBev’ and ‘OmegaBarr’ series.  The business is also developing antiviral and anti-microbial paper for applications in pharma and the education &amp;amp; stationery businesses, as well as moulded fibre-based products that are biodegradable and compostable. To bring the power of cutting edge digital technologies to farmers, ITC will launch a Super App during the year, called ITC MAARS Metamarket for Advanced Agriculture and Rural Services Are investors happy with ITC’s performance? What is your broad message to investors?   We are sharply focused on creating long-term sustained value for stakeholders, delivering superior performance and enhancing competitiveness of each business. During the three pre-pandemic years from FY17 to FY20, ITC’s EPS grew by 47 percent. Return on Segment Capital Employed has moved up from 61 percent in 2017 to 72 percent in 2020. A strategy reset with structural interventions has been put in place to sustain higher levels of competitiveness, growth and profitability.  As I have mentioned earlier in this interview, we are building an FMCG business at scale leveraging unique enterprise strengths, purposeful innovation, investments in digitalisation amongst others.  In other segments like Agriculture and Paperboards, we continue to strengthen our leadership position and build new levers of growth and competitiveness. Overall, the focus will continue to be on enabling sustained long-term value creation for shareholders.  We have embarked on an ambitious journey for the future and I am confident that the ‘ITC Next’ strategy will provide new wings to the company to make it even more agile, resilient, innovative and compassionate.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/companies-2/exclusive-digital-and-sustainability-are-mega-trends-that-will-shape-the-post-pandemic-future-itc-chairman-sanjiv-puri-7990261.html,0,0.0

ITC,2022-01-09T13:40:04+05:30,2022-01-09,Abhishek Mande Bhot,Fine dining came home during the pandemic; no more soggy salad (or pizza),"The moment the home delivery option was turned on, it freed up restaurateurs to think beyond their pre-existing menus. The field was wide open.","Just a couple of weeks into the national lockdown in March 2020, IHCL, the holding company of luxury hotel brands such as Taj, figured that if it had any hope of doing business in the coming months, it would have to find a way to home deliver food from its many award-winning restaurants. Hotel stays were down to zero and were likely going to stay that way, so restaurants were the key source of income now.  Fine-dining restaurants, especially the kinds that are part of luxury hotel chains, place as much importance on the venue, ambience, service, presentation, etc., as on the food itself. It also isn’t unusual for a fine-dining restaurants to refuse requests to pack leftovers to preserve the sanctity of the dish. So, the very idea of running a fine-dining business on the same model as a roadside delivery restaurant was unthinkable. Then again, so was the idea of the entire world grinding to a halt.  Taj would go on to launch Qmin, an app that would home-deliver food from its restaurants. Other hotel chains such as ITC and Marriot also launched their food-delivery services, albeit through phone calls and WhatsApp messages. For anyone remotely connected to the food and beverage (F&amp;amp;B) industry, it was evident that to survive, they’d have to home deliver their food, fine dining or not.  For Gauri Devidayal, director of Food Matters, the company that runs a handful of restaurants including The Table, a fine-dining restaurant, and Mag St Kitchen, a cool experimental space, an unlikely opportunity presented itself.  Mag St Bread Co started out as a bakery supplying breads and other basic baked goods to some of the best-known cafes and restaurants in Mumbai. With the 2020 lockdown causing restaurants to shut down, Mag St Bread Co’s business was affected, too, at first. “But as soon as delivery of essential items was allowed, the demand for breads and baked goods increased,” Devidayal recollects. And just like that, a brand that was essentially B2B (business to business), began retailing to individual customers. “For a while, Mag St Bread Co was our only fully-functional brand,” she says.  The unexpected success of Mag St Bread Co made Devidayal realise that she’d have to make the menus of some of her other restaurants delivery-friendly, too. This was easier to do for some restaurants; for others, it took a little creative thinking.  Devidayal relaunched Miss T, an Asian restaurant that boasted of a cool mixology programme but had shut long before the pandemic, as a delivery kitchen. The drinks went out but gyozas, sobas, pho bowls, and salads stayed. “But instead of just sending them as a regular delivery restaurant would, we packed the ingredients separately with assembly and/or heating instructions,” she says. This ensured that ingredients in dishes such as salads or pho, remained fresh, didn’t get soggy, and the diner could have their meal by assembling it at their convenience instead of gulping it down as soon as it arrived.  Devidayal followed the same model for her other restaurants including The Table, whose original menu was not designed for delivery. “We launched a separate delivery-only menu with dishes we knew could travel and relied on our customers to follow the DIY assembly instructions,” she says. Today, all of Devidayal’s restaurants home deliver, some even as far as Alibaug, a 50-minute ferry-ride across the Arabian Sea.  The moment the home delivery option was turned on, it freed up restaurateurs to think beyond their pre-existing menus. The field was wide open. For Devidayal it meant launching Mag St Pizza Co, a gourmet pizza brand that likely wouldn’t have opened if it weren’t for the pandemic. In home dining has to be exciting in that it should bring as much of the restaurant and its philosophy as possible to the diner’s home. - Radhika Dhariwal, co-founder, Passcode Hospitality Pizza was also the direction which restaurateur A.D. Singh took when it came to home delivery. Singh runs Olive Bar and Kitchen, with restaurants in most Indian metropolises. After experimenting with social distancing using mannequins in designer outfits and creating booths around tables, and offering chef-at-home services, Singh is launching Olive Pizzeria. The gourmet pizza kitchen will add to his roster of brands like Fatty Bao that already deliver nationally and by his own account “helped us reach some level of survival during the pandemic”.  With Olive Pizzeria, Singh’s aim is to not just create recipes that can travel better but also create packaging that survives the journey and stands out in his diners’ memory. Branding, he says, is key.  Also read: A.D. Singh: &quot;About 30% of restaurants will shut down&quot;  Also building menus for delivery and rethinking packaging is Radhika Dhariwal, co-founder of Passcode Hospitality that’s best known for launching PCO, a speakeasy in Delhi, in 2012.  Curating the right menu was easy for some of Passcode Hospitality's restaurants like Pings, an Asian street food restaurant that lends itself to delivery. For others, like SAZ, a brasserie specialising in elevated American cuisine, it was a little difficult. So, like Devidayal and Singh, she leaned in on traditional favourites that she knew would get picked up easily and would travel well. In the case of SAZ this included pastas, pizzas, soups, sandwiches, and burgers.  Besides curating the menus, Dhariwal and her team also spent time developing packaging: think eco-friendly boxes, cloth bags that could be reused. “Because in-home dining experience can’t just be about the food,” she says. “It has to be exciting in that it should bring as much of the restaurant and its philosophy as possible to the diner’s home.”  In this, Zorawar Kalra agrees with Singh and Dhariwal.  Kalra owns Massive Restaurants that runs over 32 restaurants across the country and a few overseas too. He says, “We’ve spent a lot of time and money in developing packaging for the meals we home deliver. Sushis go with gel packs, burgers go in boxes with magnets, etc. A lot of thought has gone into the look and quality of each packaging because it’s the best way to showcase your brand and give your customers a high-end experience at home.”  During this time, Kalra has also launched two delivery-only brands – Louis Burger and Butter Delivery. He’s been bullish on cloud kitchen for the higher return on investment (ROI) it tends to fetch compared with a brick-and-mortar restaurant.  “If there is a third wave (of Covid-19),” Kalra says, “it will be devastating to the restaurant industry. Cloud kitchens help make organisations leaner, control expenditure and so cloud is an important play for us.”  It isn’t surprising, therefore, that Kalra is looking to raise fresh capital to expand his cloud kitchen footprint to a dozen new cities by the end of March 2022.    Kalra has been heralding the end of fine-dining culture and the beginning of the gourmet comfort food trend. “The age of fine dining is coming to an end,” he told me somewhat dramatically in 2019 at the launch of Younion a hip bar that was clearly aimed at Gen Z and millennials. To be sure, he hasn’t launched a new fine-dining brand since, but a large part of his empire does comprise those restaurants. And like everyone else, he’s had to rethink his menu along the lines of what can travel and what can’t. While he doesn’t get into the details of how much tweaking he’s had to make to each of his menus, he says that sometimes it involves changing the cooking process of some dishes “like double frying something so it doesn’t get chewy by the time it reaches you”.  Also read: It's all gravy: Restaurateurs dial up focus on more premium cloud kitchens  Today, delivery contributes anywhere between 20% and 35% to the businesses of those with whom we spoke, a sharp rise from a meagre 5-10% at the beginning of 2020. But everyone agrees that it can likely never replace in-restaurant dining.  Kalra, somewhat dramatically, calls restaurant dining the last bastion of human interaction. But Sanjay Vazirani, who runs restaurants such as China Bistro, India Bistro, and Glocal Junction, says, “Convenience will be key, and the focus will have to be on building out hybrid models of restaurants.”  So, while like the others, Vazirani has also curated special delivery menus and put a lot of thought in packaging, he’s also repurposing a part of his restaurant kitchens to support newer delivery-only brands like Art of Dum.  “Experiential brands like Glocal Junction (a sprawling, all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant chain) will rely on in-restaurant diners, but we also have to acknowledge that a lot of people may not want to have comprehensive meals. So, we see an enormous potential in delivery too,” he says, adding that there’s no easy answer to what the future holds. “We’ll have to be agile and shift our SOPs (standard operating procedures) as per the needs and expectations of the times.”  Also read: “Minimalism coupled with great styling and single cuisine menus will rule Indian weddings”: Sanjay Vazirani",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/lifestyle-trends/fine-dining-came-home-during-the-pandemic-no-more-soggy-salad-or-pizza-within-minutes-of-delivery-7915801.html,2,2.0
ITC,2021-12-30T17:40:05+05:30,2021-12-30,Devika Singh,Inflation to remain a worry but demand will be strong in 2022: FMCG players,"Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) makers such as ITC, Parle and Agro Tech Foods weigh in on major trends lie inflation that would have an impact on the industry in 2022.","Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) makers are bracing for inflation in key inputs in 2022, but expect it to be offset by strong demand for their products in the coming year.  Two major trends in 2022 will be an uptick in discretionary spending and consumer movement towards branded products, several companies in the FMCG sector told Moneycontrol.  “While we expect the overall inflationary trends to continue, the discretionary spends have picked up in the last few quarters. In the last six-eight months, we have seen a good uptick in categories like snacks, juices, premium biscuits, deodorants, and premium soaps. We see this trend continuing in the upcoming year as well,” said an ITC spokesperson.  Inflation lingers  FMCG companies have been battling price inflation in several key commodities such as palm oil, tea and packaging material since the onset of the pandemic. In 2021, the prices of most commodities rose to unprecedented levels.  “Edible oils climbed by 50-60 percent, wheat prices went up by 10-12 percent, packaging material costs, because of the rise in crude prices, rose by 20-24 percent and freight charges jumped by 17-18 percent in the last on year,” said Mayah Shah, senior category head at Parle Products Pvt. Ltd.  As a result, he said, you see inflation in one or two products, but this kind of price rise across commodities become difficult to handle.  Shah expects the situation to continue unabated in the coming months.  “We don’t see prices going down; prices of most commodities will continue to climb,” he added.  Asheesh Sharma, vice president of marketing at Agro Tech Foods Ltd, believes the prices of locally-sourced commodities will come down at the start of the financial year 2023; prices of imported commodities such as edible oils will take time to subside.  Rural India to bounce back?  Rural India, which proved to be a life-saver for FMCG companies as urban India struggled with disruptions due to the lockdowns and two waves of the pandemic, showed signs of plateauing in the second quarter of the financial year 2022.  According to data, insights and consulting company Kantar Group, rural areas reported 1.5 percent growth in the September quarter compared to 4.5 percent growth in the year-ago period.  Companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd were hurt by the slowdown.  “Rural demand in the past few quarters has been resilient thanks to government initiatives such as higher spending on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, food subsidies, direct cash transfers to farmers and a decent harvest,” said Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director of HUL, India’s largest FMCG company.  “Now, as mobility improves and urban markets see a pick-up, rural centres, though they are still growing, their growth rates have moderated,” he said.  FMCG companies expect this to be a minor blip and predict that the hinterland would bounce back in the coming year.  “We expect rural to continue to show resilience given the increased government spending in rural and agri-sector in FY 2021-22 and the multiplier effect it will have on the rural economy going forward,” said the ITC spokesperson.  Discretionary categories to lead  Consumer goods companies like ITC and Agro Tech Foods project that discretionary categories will continue to lead the segment in 2022. Agro Tech, in fact, is betting on its newly launched products in the non-essential segments to revive its margins.  “We see a significant opportunity in both our cereals and chocolates categories we have entered into with our superior differentiated offerings and therefore the ability to fully harness the benefit of superior margins offered by these categories,” said Sharma of Agro Tech.  Analysts concur. A recent note by ICICI Securities said: “Companies operating in the discretionary category will maintain a better growth trajectory in 2022 driven by factors such as sharp demand recovery (mostly priced in), store expansion and (some) cost efficiencies driving operating leverage and industry tailwinds (QSR, jewellery). “ QSR is short for quick-service restaurants.  The brokerage has a neutral stance on staples. “Demand uncertainty during periods of high inflation is a tough challenge to navigate as companies look to manage growth and margins,” it wrote.  “Peak margins for most with increasing salience of e-commerce and modern trade likely means years of margin headwinds for FMCG. We reckon most companies are getting distracted from their core agenda of penetration-driven growth as they worry about disruption in all facets of operations. That said, we expect the industry formalisation thesis to sustain,” ICICI Securities wrote about companies operating in the staples category.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/inflation-to-remain-a-worry-but-demand-will-be-strong-in-2022-fmcg-players-7883531.html,1,0.5
ITC,2021-12-24T20:19:32+05:30,2021-12-24,Shreeja Singh,"MSMEs fear harassment, misuse of power by officials under new GST regime",The rules were amended to empower GST officials to initiate recovery proceedings against businesses without providing a show-cause notice for any mismatches in forms GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B.,"Small businesses are fearing increased harassment by tax officials in the New Year when the amended Goods and Services Tax (GST) rules will come into effect. The rules were amended to empower GST officials to initiate recovery proceedings against businesses without providing a show-cause notice for any mismatches in forms GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B.  Until now, the tax officials were required to issue show-cause notices before initiating recovery proceedings.  The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) recently notified January 1, 2022, as the effective date for implementation of this new rule. Several other changes will also come into effect from that day. The changes meant to tighten the tax regime were announced in the Union Budget for 2021-22. The amended rules were notified only on December 21.  The move is aimed at curbing instances of fake billing by the buyers whereby the sellers show high sales under the GSTR-1. Such practices allow buyers to claim input tax credits (ITC) and underreport sales in the GSTR-3B form to reduce their GST liability.  The original Central GST Act provided for forms GSTR-1 for details of outward supplies, GSTR-2 for inward supplies data or purchases made, and GSTR-3, a document containing electronically collated details of all transactions in a particular month, filed in GSTR-1 and GSTR-2, and tax liability.  However, associations representing the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and legal experts fear that the new stricter form of GST may lead to misuse of power and harassment by the authorities.  They observed that the incoming stricter GST rules would not only increase the compliances and litigations for the MSMEs but will also lead to harassment at the hands of tax authorities.  Fear of harassment, misuse of power  Rakesh Chhabra, Vice President, Federation of Indian Micro and Small &amp;amp; Medium Enterprises (FISME) observed that businesses will face harassment by the tax authorities even in the instances wherein an honest clerical error has occurred causing a mismatch in the forms. This, he said, would ultimately lead to expensive court proceedings forcing the sellers to shut shop.  &quot;The government itself has been having problems with its tax portal for so many months. Can a clerical error not happen by the MSMEs?&quot; questioned Chhabra.  An MSME entrepreneur from Coimbatore who did not wish to be named said, &quot;The government has been saying so many things about bringing ease of doing businesses. But this is just the opposite of it, more like inspector raj.&quot;  The entrepreneur feared that in the instance of mismatch, the tax authorities will not give notice and instead arrive at the factories unannounced to harass.  Vinod Kumar, president of India SME Forum said that the incoming rule would give exclusive power to the officials in the GST department because the new system does not delve into the reasons behind the mismatch in the forms.  He explained that there are several instances wherein the buyers return the products to the seller and demand a refund. However, the same would not reflect in the form GSTR-3B which had originally captured the transaction. This, he said, would result in a mismatch in the two forms which would ultimately invite the tax authorities despite no fault on the part of the seller.  &quot;So while the seller has to give a refund to the buyer, he will also be forced to give the GST on the same transaction,&quot; said Kumar.  Right to hearing   Sameer Jain, Managing Partner, PSL Advocates &amp;amp; Solicitors said, &quot;The mismatch can be for various reasons, some of which are explainable. Not issuing a notice essentially takes away a right of hearing where an assessee has an opportunity to explain its position qua non-payment and/ or mismatch.&quot;  Sharing a similar sentiment, Ashok Saigal, Co-Chairman at CII’s (Confederation of Indian Industry) National MSME Council noted that the new rules go against the natural course of justice where the seller would not even get the opportunity to make his argument.  &quot;Ultimately, the MSMEs would have to bear the brunt because they don't have the right infrastructure or a computerised system unlike the big businesses to keep a check of all the transactions and invoices. Moreover, genuine clerical mishaps can happen,&quot; he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/msmes-fear-harassment-misuse-of-power-by-officials-under-new-gst-regime-7862571.html,1,1.0

The company’s demerger plans and its strategy for the FMCG business were other highlights of the occasion, analysts told Moneycontrol.  Puri indicated the company is open to look at a demerger of the FMCG business or a separate listing of its IT business to unlock further potential.

Morgan Stanley  Maintain &quot;overweight&quot; rating on the stock with target at Rs 251.  The management is focussed on creating sustained shareholder value.  The company remains committed to its plan of restructuring the hotels business as the industry stabilizes.  Jefferies  Maintain &quot;buy&quot; call on ITC with target at Rs 300.  The digital interventions are touching all aspects of its business.  The maiden analyst meet shows how the management is working towards making the company a future-ready enterprise.  JPMorgan  Keep &quot;neutral&quot; rating on the stock with target at Rs 238, as the valuations at 17x FY23E are not demanding.  Revenue recovery momentum is improving across cigarettes, hotels and the paper business.  The budget session will be keenly watched for any potential tax change on cigarettes.  Motilal Oswal  The analyst meeting was a welcome move by the management as it provided a platform for a comprehensive discussion on the prospects and concerns of its various businesses.  While the stock has delivered ~8% return over the last three months, it has considerably underperformed its benchmark and consumer peers over the last five years.  We value ITC at 15x Dec'23E EPS. We maintain our target price of Rs 240 per share and our neutral rating.  Sharekhan  ITC’s management has enhanced focus and redefined growth strategies for all its business verticals to improve its growth prospects in medium to long term.  The company has sustained ESG rating of AA by MSCI-ECG, the highest among global tobacco companies.  The management is committed towards restructuring of its hotel business post recovery in the industry, and it will evaluate unlocking value in the Infotech and FMCG businesses once it attains scale. However, there is no stated timeline for the restructuring.  We maintain our buy recommendation on the stock with an unchanged price target of Rs 280.  Prabhudas Lilladher  We remain positive on the business strategy, although uncertainty on cigarette taxation and global aversion to investment in tobacco stocks remains an overhang.  ITC trades at 16.3x Sept23 EPS, with ~4.5% dividend yield and 10.7% EPS CAGR over FY21-24, 55% discount to coverage universe. Maintain &quot;buy&quot; with SOTP based target price of Rs 270.

ITC is evaluating the demerger of the FMCG business and separate listing of the IT business to unlock more opportunities, Puri indicated.","ITC’s top management discussed taxation on cigarette business, demerger plans and the strategy for the FMCG business going ahead in its first-ever investor meet on December 14, said analysts. The company’s top management stressed that the health ministry makes regular recommendations annually, as it tried to allay concerns about higher taxation on its mainstay cigarettes business.  “I hope a reasonable perspective emerges out of all the deliberations and expect any increase in taxation to be well spaced out in any case,” said ITC Chairman Sanjiv Puri, according to analysts attending the event. He also highlighted that the health ministry's recommendation this time is much wider and covers tobacco products other than cigarettes as well.  Investors have been worried about ITC’s performance since the government formed an expert panel to prepare a tax policy on all tobacco products. A decline in cigarette consumption globally has also been concerning investors. However, Puri said sales volumes for cigarettes are already back to pre-pandemic levels. Though there have been significant disruptions in categories like cigarettes since the pandemic's onset, it has now recovered well, said the executive. ITC expects to gain market share due to government's action on illicit cigarettes given the taxation remains stable.  The company’s demerger plans and its strategy for FMCG business were other highlights of the occasion, analysts told Moneycontrol. Puri indicated the company is open to look at a demerger of FMCG business or a separate listing of IT business to unlock further potential. He also talked about the demerger plans of its hotel business and said the company plans an action once the hospitality industry recovers.  FMCG: A key growth lever  During the event, analysts said the company discussed its plans for FMCG business at length. ITC said it is looking for merger and acquisition opportunities, especially, for its FMCG business after seeing a good performance of its recent acquisitions -- Savlon, Nimyle, Sunrise. The company has set a Rs 1 trillion revenue by FY30 for its FMCG business and Puri said the company is committed to building a large FMCG business in the country.  The company also discussed its investment plan, under which it plans to invest Rs 10,000 crore in the next three years to create growth vectors. Of this, 35-40 percent would go towards FMCG capacity expansion, while 25-30 percent towards ITC Paperboards. About 10 percent of the capital would be spent on completing its major hotel projects and the rest of the sum on building digital capabilities.  Under its FMCG plan, Puri outlined, the company will continue to scale and fortify power brands and leverage them to address adjacencies. “We will continue having regionally strong brands and building segments of the future to achieve ambitious FMCG plans,” he said.  ITC also discussed inflation and the stress on its margins due to high input costs during the event. The company’s management said that though it is witnessing unprecedented inflation in edible oil, palm oil, packaging, it has been able to sustain 9 percent EBITDA margins in the first half of FY22.  Other businesses  ITC has witnessed a strong recovery in the hotel business with improvement in consumer sentiment and mobility. Leisure travel, it indicated, is doing well but business travel is still weak and is currently at 40-50 percent of the pre-COVID levels. However, hotel occupancy, ITC said, is already back to pre-pandemic levels and it expects the third quarter to be better than the second quarter for its hotel business.  Giving an outlook for its infotech business, the company said it sees tremendous potential in the IT business, especially, in the current environment.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/itc-allays-concerns-about-higher-tax-on-cigarettes-discusses-demerger-plans-in-first-ever-investor-meet-7826191.html,0,0.0

ITC,2021-12-10T07:56:39+05:30,2021-12-10,"Karan Pai, CMT"," Hot Stocks | Double-digit returns from ITC, Aditya Birla Capital and Zee Entertainment likely in short...","Karan Pai of GEPL Capital believes that Nifty50 might continue to hover around the 20-week SMA (17,344) and might remain rangebound between 17,200 (multiple touch point levels) and 17,800 (3-week high).","Nifty seems to have halted its fall, at for now. It found support near the 16,891-mark on December 6, 2021, and since then it has been moving higher.  The price action on the shorter time frame suggests that currently the prices are moving out of a range (16,782-17,490) and attempting to move higher.  On the options open interest front, (December 16, 2021) highest open interest addition was seen in the 18,500 Call and 2nd highest open interest addition was seen in the 17,200 Put contracts, thus we can expect the broader range of the index to be 17,200-18,500.  We believe that in the sessions to come, the prices might continue to hover around the 20-week SMA (17,344) and might remain rangebound between 17,200 (multiple touch point levels) and 17,800 (3-week high). If the prices breach above the 17,800-mark, we might see a move towards the 18,500 (multiple touch point level) and 18,600 (previous swing high) level.  The key level to watch for on the downside will be the 17,200 level. If the prices breach below the 17,200 we might see a drop towards 17,000 (psychological support level) and 16,800 (recent swing low) mark.    Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:  Aditya Birla Capital: Buy | LTP: Rs 124.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 115 | Target: Rs 161 | Return: about 29% from the current level.  Aditya Birla Capital for the past 9 months had been moving lower in well-channelized manner. In the week starting November 29, 2021, the prices not only broke but also closed above the upper trend line of the channel. In the current week, the prices managed to sustain above the previous week high and move higher.  On the indicator front, the RSI (relative strength index) plotted on the weekly chart can be seen moving higher towards the overbought level, indicating increasing bullish momentum in the prices.  Looking at the prices action and the technical parameters mentioned above we expect Aditya Birla Capital to move higher immediately towards Rs 149, post which we might see the prices test Rs 161.  Aditya Birla Capital seems to be a good buying candidate with upside targets of Rs 149 and Rs 161, we recommend a stop loss level of Rs 115 on daily closing basis for this setup.    ITC: Buy | CMP: Rs 235.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 215 | Target: Rs 282 | Return: 20 percent  ITC on the short term time frame can be seen moving higher after finding support near the Rs 217 mark on December 6, 2021.  The stock gained momentum on December 9 and managed to capture the 20-week SMA (simple moving average).  On the indicator front, the RSI plotted on the weekly time frame witnessed a range shift and has been above the 50 mark since November 2020 with mild whipsaws. Currently it is placed above the 50 mark and is moving higher towards the overbought level, indicating increasing bullishness in the trend.  The prices action and the technical parameters mentioned above point towards the possibility of the prices moving higher towards the Rs 259 mark. If the prices sustain above Rs 259 mark we might see the prices move higher towards the Rs 282 and Rs 310 eventually.  ITC is currently bouncing off a support level and is moving higher. So the risk-reward level is very favourable for an investor. One can buy ITC at current levels and hold it with a target of Rs 259 and Rs 282 with a strict stop-loss of Rs 215 on daily closing basis.    Zee Entertainment Enterprises: Buy | LTP: Rs 367.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 333 | Target: Rs 440 | Return: 20 percent  Zee Entertainment Enterprises for the past couple of months has been drifting higher after finding support near the Rs 285 mark. In the week started December 6, 2021 the prices gained momentum and managed to move and close above the previous swing high of Rs 362.  The RSI plotted on the weekly chart can be seen moving higher as the prices resume its uptrend after a correction, indicating increasing bullish momentum as the prices resume its up move after a correction.  The momentum indicators and the technical parameters all point towards the possibility of the prices moving higher towards the Rs 406 mark immediately. If this level is breached, we might see the prices move towards Rs 440-480 level eventually.  Our bullish view will be negated if the prices breach below Rs 333. We also recommend this level to be a strict stop loss on closing basis.

Developed by scientists at ITC Life Sciences and Technology Centre (LSTC), Bengaluru, the company plans to market the nasal spray under the Savlon brand once it gets all the requisite regulatory approvals, according to sources.  When contacted for comments, a spokesperson of ITC said, &quot;We are unable to share more details at the current moment as the clinical trials are underway.&quot;  The spokesperson declined to comment on a detailed query on where is the clinical trial being done, from where the commercial production would be done when approved and under what brand the nasal spray would be marketed.

They further said the product has the potential to be effective and safe in preventing infection and transmission of COVID-19 along with the existing measures of hygiene recommended by health authorities.  ITC’s LSTC has been at the core of the company’s drive for science led product innovation to support and build its wide range of product portfolio.

Cigarette volumes for ITC and even other players globally have been on a declining trend, given the increased health consciousness among consumers over the last decade. With the government having recently (Oct'21) set up an expert panel tasked with preparing a comprehensive tax policy proposal for all forms of tobacco from a public health perspective, the overhang of a policy change that may affect cigarette volumes remains on the stock. The rumored demerger of ITC Infotech, even at INR200-250b, is only 6-8% of ITC's current market capitalization and is partly factored in the price already. In our opinion, it does not portend demerger of other FMCG or the Hotels business in the near term, nor does it reduce the dependence on its Cigarette EBIT.

ITC's food business chief Hemant Malik told The Economic Times that the company had launched breakfast staples including rawa, suji and vermicelli.  They will also introduce categories such as dalia, poha and millet cereals. With this foray, the company will compete with established brands such as Kellogg, Nestle, MTR and Gits Food in the segment.  &quot;Aashirvaad has largely been a brand with products for meal occasions, be it atta, salt, pulses or ghee. We are extending the brand into other value-added segments with which one can cook breakfast or snacks,&quot; the report said quoting Malik.  &quot;Some of these categories have huge scope and have the capacity to generate good margins by leveraging our scale, wheat adjacencies and supply chain efficiency,&quot; Malik added.  ITC's non-cigarette FMCG business contributed to 27 percent of the company's overall revenue in Q2 FY22 at Rs 4,036 crore, whereas its cigarettes business contributed to 38 percent of revenue at Rs 5,642 crore.

ITC,2021-11-19T17:22:24+05:30,2021-11-19,Subhayan Chakraborty,Farm laws fiasco: Much ado about nothing or a lost opportunity?,Farmer unions might press for statutory guarantee of remunerative prices for all agricultural produce and for all cultivators.,"The government’s decision to repeal the three contentious farm laws may not negatively impact business on the ground because they were not actively implemented in the first place, said industry executives.  &quot;The three farm laws repealed by the central government, were not executed on the ground level like the government had intended when they were introduced in 2020, due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and farmer agitations across the country. Hence, their repeal will not have a major impact,&quot; a senior official from packaged food major ITC Ltd said.  After a year long protest by farmers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday the repeal will be completed in the winter session of Parliament.  The three laws gave farmers the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country, sought to destroy the monopoly of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees,  and provide a legal framework for contract farming among other things. The government also proposed to scrap its powers to impose stockholding limit on food items, except under extraordinary circumstances.  With small and marginal farmers comprising over 80 percent of the agricultural class, cultivators felt the contract farming model would be skewed to favour large companies. They also felt this signalled the end of the minimum support price (MSP) system of procurement by the government, the largest buyer of farm produce.  Not everyone agreed with the ITC officer’s assessment though. Officials from sugar companies such as Shree Renuka Sugar Ltd and Bajaj Hindustan Sugar Ltd said that the repeal of the three farm laws is a backward step when trying to move towards a market-driven agriculture economy.  They added that logistical bottlenecks in procurement of raw materials, which the farm laws were going to address, will remain and raw material costs will remain high due to lack of market driven rates.  &quot;Sugarcane procurement rates will once again be determined by central government set prices rather than a market-driven scenario, which was proposed under the now-repealed farm laws,&quot; an official said on condition of anonymity.  Others were optimistic of structural reforms emerging from the new committee that has been announced.  &quot;The decision to form a committee to address  farm issues would go a long way to identify the actual pain points of the farmers and help the government to make adequate farm policy to enhance the income level of the farmers,&quot; Pradeep Multani, President, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI).  This would particularly help marginal farmers who comprise 80 percent of total farmers and hold less than 2 hectare of land, he stressed. PHDCCI is the largest industry association in the northern states of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.  Farmer organisations also said the move would change little on ground. &quot;We have to see what happens going forward. But what I believe is that the unions and protestors should suspend the agitation and give the government time to deliver,&quot; said Ajay Vir Jakhar, agri policy expert and former Chairman of the Punjab State Farmers' &amp;amp; Farm Workers' Commission.  Jakhar has been longtime Chairman of Bharat Krishak Samaj (Indian Farmers Forum) and said that in case the farmers are not happy, they can return to Delhi before the 2024 national elections.  However, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha on Friday said it will wait for the announcement to take effect through due parliamentary procedures before declaring victory.  &quot;If this happens, it will be a historic victory of the one year long farmers' struggle in India. However, nearly 700 farmers have been martyred in this struggle. The central government's obstinacy is responsible for these avoidable deaths, including the murders at Lakhimpur Kheri,&quot; it stressed.  Saying that further decisions will be announced soon, the SKM said the farm agitation was not just for the repeal of the three laws, but also for a statutory guarantee of remunerative prices for all agricultural produce and for all farmers.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/industry-view-on-farm-laws-repeal-some-say-not-much-impact-others-rue-lost-opportunity-7739911.html,2,2.0

ITC,2021-11-04T13:42:48+05:30,2021-11-04,Pallavi Pengonda,Value Stocks: The low-risk way to grow your wealth,"Four value stocks that could give you the benefit of high dividend, healthy cash flows and even an option value","The Indian stock market staged an outstanding performance since last Diwali, primarily on the hopes of faster recovery from the adverse impact of the pandemic. Of course, ample liquidity also helped matters.  The upshot: stocks are richly valued across the board. For conservative investors for whom capital protection is a priority, buying value stocks makes tremendous sense. Value investing is about buying stocks that are trading at prices lower than the company’s worth fundamentally.  Of course, what goes into that valuation could be divergent but largely the idea is not to pay excessively for growth expectations. This Diwali, we have picked up the following four value stocks for you. ITC In a market where valuations are elevated, it’s a rarity to find a bluechip stock available cheap. But tobacco major ITC fits into this bracket. The stock has been undervalued for sometime, testing the patience of investors waiting for the value to unlock. That has not happened so far because not only tobacco as a business is loathed by global investors for the health hazard that comes with it, markets also fear declining tobacco sales as a threat to growth.  The government’s move to continuously raise taxes will depress volume growth in the business that delivers around 85 percent of profits (earnings before interest and tax) for ITC. But then, cash flows are for real and stock market probably can’t ignore that for long, especially in a market where stocks offering stable growth are overpriced.  “ITC offers an attractive 5 percent FY23 dividend yield and we expect double-digit earnings CAGR over FY22-24,” wrote Kunal Vora of BNP Paribas Securities India Pvt Ltd in a report on October 28. CAGR refers to compound annual growth rate. ITC cigarettes business is seeing a good recovery after the second COVID wave. ITC has said cigarette volumes saw smart recovery during the September quarter (Q2FY22) with volumes towards the end of the quarter at near pre-pandemic levels. This sets the stage for better recovery from Q3 unless a third wave hits the country. As the economy normalises, ITC’s other businesses too are expected to see a decent bounce back. At some point, a spin-off of the various businesses may unlock value embedded in the different businesses. NTPC If banks are a proxy for the economy, power is the proxy for the manufacturing sector. In fact, it is a proxy for the economy, too. NTPC Ltd in that sense is really a play on the economy, except that being a utility, its returns are capped. NTPC has been going cheap, again because the market is enamoured by renewables and unenthused by thermal energy, which is NTPC’s mainstay now. But NTPC actually offers the best of both worlds.  “While the high concentration of coal-thermal projects had raised ESG (environment, social and governance) concerns on the company, we see incremental efforts toward RE expansion,” said analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a report on October 31. The brokerage further added, “This, along with an improvement in the RoE (return on equity) profile, should lead to a re-rating in the stock.” NTPC’s ambitious RE expansion is expected to assuage ESG concerns. NTPC plans to have around 15GW RE capacity by financial year 2024 (FY24) and another 45GW capacity by FY32. As such, NTPC’s low cost of funding is a distinct advantage for its RE expansion.  “Potential monetisation of its RE and power trading subsidiaries could further improve shareholders’ returns in the coming years,” said a recent report from Sharekhan Ltd.  NTPC’s shares have appreciated by around 38 percent so far this calendar year, reflecting the bright outlook to some extent. But it trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 8 times for FY23 estimates based on average estimates of a few brokerages and its price-to-book ratio stands at 0.9 times. That’s cheap. NMDC The NMDC Ltd shares have underperformed the broader markets in the past six months. To that extent, valuations of the iron ore producer are cheap. NMDC is a play on strong iron ore prices and volumes. It plans to raise its production meaningfully over the coming years. According to its FY21 annual report, the company plans to reach the capacity of 67 mtpa (million tonnes per annum) by 2025. In FY21, production stood at 34.1 mtpa. NMDC is primarily an iron ore producer but it is also a rare earth elements play. In 2018, NMDC signed an MOU with Indian Rare Earths Ltd, which proposes to explore opportunities in rare earths in India and abroad. This could provide some option value in the stock. Indian billionaire investor Radhakishan Damani is amongst top 25 shareholders of NMDC.  In its Q4FY21 investors presentation, NMDC informed Damani owned 34 lakh shares of the company or 0.12 percent equity. According to NMDC’s Q1FY22 presentation, as on July 31, Damani owned around 54 lakh shares or 0.19 percent holding. Further, investors should watch the progress on the commissioning of the 3 mtpa steel plant at Nagarnar, Chhattisgarh. Analysts believe the demerger of the steel plant would create value for shareholders. For the September quarter (Q2FY22), NMDC is expected to report strong set of numbers year-on-year on the back of healthy realisations and higher sales volume. NMDC has said, “With a 56% increase in production and a 37% increase in sales over CPLY (corresponding period last year), the Navratna PSE surpassed its previous best Q2 performance.” Container Corp of India Container Corp of India Ltd (Concor), trading about 10 percent away from their 52-week highs of Rs 754.40, has a solid presence in the logistics sector. For now, Concor expects volumes to get a boost from the partial commissioning of the DFC (dedicated freight corridor).  Further, pleased with the growth momentum seen in the half year ending September, Concor’s management has revised its FY22 guidance for revenue to 15 percent (from 12 percent earlier). The company now expects its profit after tax to more than double year-on-year for FY22. Going ahead, the full commissioning of the DFC is positive from volume perspective. “The DFC potential has started unlocking and the much-awaited divestment (potentially in FY23) could be the trigger that further re-rates the stock,” said analysts from Edelweiss Securities Ltd. “We expect significant earnings growth in FY23-25E and hence expect the upside to materialise.” This state-owned company is a candidate for disinvestment. Thus, needless to say, investors would do well to monitor news flow on the divestment, going ahead. Further, investors should also keep a close eye on land policy by the government for long-term leasing.  “Land policy finalisation is awaited (Cabinet approval awaited) which will allow the company to pay upfront for 30 years LLF and lock in the present rates,” said ICICI Securities’ analysts. Based on the average FY23 estimates of a few brokerages, the Concor stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 30 times.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/value-stocks-the-low-risk-way-to-grow-your-wealth-7678261.html,0,0.0

ITC,2021-10-29T08:37:45+05:30,2021-10-29,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"Trade Spotlight | What should you do with ITC, IndusInd Bank, United Spirits stocks?",Here's what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities advises investors holding these stocks on trading today.,"Bears took full control over Dalal Street on October 28 with all sectoral indices caught in their trap, driving the benchmarks down nearly 2 percent. It was the biggest single-day fall since April 2021, as global brokerage house Morgan Stanley downgraded Indian equities to equal-weight from overweight due to expensive valuations.  The BSE Sensex fell below the psychological 60,000 mark, down 1,158.63 points, to close at 59,984.70. The Nifty50 also closed well below the crucial 18,000 milestone, falling 353.70 points, to close at 17,857.30.  Bank Nifty, metal and realty were prominent losers with more than 3 percent correction. Pharma and FMCG indices corrected around 2 percent each.  Stocks that were in focus included United Spirits, which was one of the outperformers in the broader space, hitting a record high of Rs 944.75 before closing with 1 percent gain at Rs 892.55. IndusInd Bank was the biggest gainer in the BSE Sensex as it touched a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,242 before closing with 2.93 percent gains at Rs 1,176 after September quarter earnings.  ITC seems to have reacted negatively to its September quarter earnings, falling 5.6 percent to close at Rs 225.10. It was the biggest loser in the BSE Sensex.  Here's what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  ITC  The stock witnessed a sharp price correction from Rs 265 resistance level. On the daily and intraday time frames, it has formed lower high and lower low formation which is broadly negative for the ITC.  However, the medium-term structure is still on the positive side. Over 15 percent price correction from the monthly highest level, currently the stock is trading near 50-day SMA (simple moving average).  We are of the view that, 50-day SMA and Rs 219 would act as a key support level for the positional traders. A sharp pullback rally up to Rs 240-245 is not ruled out if it succeeds to trade above Rs 219.  IndusInd Bank  On Thursday, the stock opened with a gap and made a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,242. But one more time it took the resistance near Rs 1,240 and corrected sharply.  The stock sees non-directional activity now. Traders are waiting for the either side breakout. For the bulls, Rs 1,220-1,240 would be the important breakout level to watch.  And if, the stock manages to close above the same, we can expect quick uptrend rally towards Rs 1,270-1,300. On the flip side, trading below Rs 1,140 may increase further weakness up to Rs 1,100-1,070.  United Spirits  In this week so far, the stock rallied over 8 percent. After a yesterday sharp reversal move, on Thursday, the stock opened with a gap up and registered a fresh all-time high of Rs 944.75.  On the weekly charts, the stock has formed strong bar reversal bullish candle along with strong modest volume. Further, on daily charts, it has formed higher bottom series pattern which also support further uptrend from current levels.  For the positional traders, Rs 850-830 would be the key level to watch. If it manages to trade above the same then we can expect uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 1,000.

Cigarette sales/EBIT grew 10% yoy, recovering to 95% of pre-Covid levels. FMCG grew 3% yoy on high comparables (2-year CAGR 11%) and maintained 10% EBITDA margins. Cigarette recovery appears healthy with exit volumes at near pre-Covid. A further increase in mobility and ITC’s initiatives on portfolio expansion should drive a healthy recovery. However, a stable taxation policy remains key to sustaining steady growth ahead. FMCG sequential trends indicate a likely pick-up in growth in H2 as the base normalizes. Increasing cost pressure may, however, limit margin gains in the immediate term. Other divisions (Hotels/Agri/Paper) saw strong growth (EBIT up 63%), led by Paper/Hotels.

ITC,2021-10-20T13:12:33+05:30,2021-10-20,Sunil Shankar Matkar,ITC corrects 6% after 26% rally. What should investors do now?,"Any increase in tax on tobacco related products hits the margin of ITC, but the company has power to pass on the cost to consumers by hiking products prices.","A seven-session rally, the market faced a drag from ITC off its record peak on Tuesday. It was perhaps the news of health ministry reviewing the taxation structure for tobacco products that had pulled the share down 6 percent. On October 20, ITC was trading 1 percent down.  The cigarettes business, which accounted for more than 40 percent to the total revenue for ITC, has seen a major relief at least since the Covid period as the government has not majorly tweaked any tax with respect to the tobacco segment.  A revival in consumption demand took the stock up 26 percent in more than a month, making it one of the major contributors to the market rally.  The Union Ministry for Health and Family Welfare has set up an expert panel to review the taxation policy for tobacco products. The panel will develop a proposal for comprehensive tax policy for tobacco products with a public health perspective, the health ministry said on October 19.  Any increase in tax on tobacco-related products erodes the margins for ITC, but the company has always passed on the cost to consumers by hiking products prices. &quot;The demand is inelastic and does not change much due to increase in price as smokers are addicted to it. There can be a knee-jerk reaction but prices move up soon,&quot; said Jay Prakash Gupta, Founder at Dhan.  Likhita Chepa, Senior Research Analyst at CapitalVia Global Research feels the proposed tax structure on tobacco products is expected to put a strain on the margins of the company as cigarettes form a significant chunk of the total business of the conglomerate.  The inflationary pressure, reflected in Hindustan Unilever's operating margin for the September quarter, was also one of the reasons for the correction in ITC, though experts feel the consumption demand is getting improved. HUL was also down over 4 percent in the previous session.  &quot;Most of the FMCG counters are continuously facing the heat of unprecedented input cost inflation and subdued consumer sentiment in the short term. A sell-off in broader markets has halted the stocks' rally and it could be profit-booking,&quot; said Ankur Saraswat, Research Analyst at Trustline Securities.  Apart from tobacco business, ITC also operates in several other businesses such as FMCG, hotels, paperboards and speciality papers, packaging, agri products and IT.  &quot;ITC's business verticals are diverse and each of the verticals have potential to create enormous wealth and value for shareholders,&quot; said Jay Prakash Gupta.  He further said ITC as a stock has underperformed over the years. The stock is not overpriced given the kind of cash flow it generates. &quot;ITC must spin off its businesses and if that is done it would create a lot of value for shareholders.&quot;  Ankur Saraswat feels the stock is available at very attractive valuations. &quot;With rapid vaccination drive leading to reopening of economy and gradual recovery in consumers demand in urban and rural areas, revival of its education and stationary products business, expected revival in hotels business, focusing on cost-saving programmes with richer business and category mix,&quot; he explained.  The net profit margin of the company for FY21 has come down to 28.65 percent from previous year's 33.17 percent but the revenue from the operations have been growing YoY. &quot;Therefore, investors can add this stock to their portfolio after a healthy correction,&quot; said Chepa of CapitalVia Global Research.  Experts expect its net profit and sales to improve going ahead, though there could be a bit of strain on margin (in cigarette business) if there is a change in tax structure.  ITC will release its second-quarter earnings on October 27. &quot;ITC is expected to see a swift recovery in cigarette volumes and other discretionary business with normalisation of our out-of-home activity. Consolidated revenues are likely to grow at 13.4 percent with an expected 9.4 percent growth in cigarettes sales,&quot; said ICICI Direct.  The brokerage expects cigarettes volumes growth of 7 percent. The hotels business is estimated to double over its low-base quarter and the FMCG and paper division is likely to grow 13.4 percent and 12.2 percent, respectively. &quot;We estimate the agri business growth at 6.5 percent on a relatively high base. We estimated 118-bps improvement in operating margins at 35.1 percent and the net profit is likely to grow 12 percent.&quot; Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment expert on Moneycontrol.com are his own and not that of the website or its management.

The price action maintained its higher top-higher bottom formation on all the timeframes like daily, weekly and monthly charts, signalling the possibility of a continuation of the uptrend in coming days.  However, the momentum indicator RSI or relative strength index is forming a series of negative divergence on daily as well as on weekly charts, indicating some caution at higher levels.  Looking at the chart, we believe the index is currently moving in a strong uptrend. We can expect the index to move higher towards 18,382 (38.2 percent extension level of 15,513 – 17,947 projected from 17,452) followed by 18,670 (50 percent extension level of 15,513 – 17,947 projected from 17,452) and eventually towards 18,957 (61.8 percent extension level of 15,513 – 17,947 projected from 17,452).  The stop loss level for the Nifty would be the 18,000 mark on closing basis.    Here are three technical buy calls for next two to three weeks:  ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 256.55 | Stop Loss: Rs 230 | Target: Rs 310 | Return: 21 percent  ITC has given a triangle pattern breakout on the weekly charts with volume confirmation a few weeks ago that shows a strong bullish undertone for the stock in the medium to long term.  Looking at the price action, momentum indicators and other technical parameters, we believe this stock has a lot of upside potential left.  Going ahead, we expect the bullish momentum to accelerate if the price goes above the previous swing high of Rs 310. If this level is breached, we might see the stock move towards Rs 322 followed by Rs 367.  The stop loss for this trade setup would be Rs 230 levels on closing basis.    Tata Consumer Products: Buy | LTP: Rs 849.60 | Stop Loss: Rs 796 | Target: Rs 960 | Return: 13 percent  The stock had entered a corrective phase after hitting a lifetime high of Rs 889 and moved lower towards Rs 796, which coincides with the 20-week simple moving average and 23.6 percent retracement level of Rs 458 to Rs 889. For the past three weeks the prices have been finding support near the same and bounced back sharply.  If this level holds, we might see prices gain momentum and move higher toward the recent lifetime highs of Rs 889 and eventually towards Rs 960 (38.2 percent extension level of Rs 458 – Rs 889 projected from Rs 796).  Investors can accumulate Tata Consumer at this point and hold with a target of Rs 889 and Rs 960, and maintain a stop loss of Rs 796 on closing basis.    Federal Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 93.10 | Stop Loss: Rs 85 | Target: Rs 110 | Return: 18 percent  Federal Bank has given a triangle pattern breakout with volume confirmation this week on the weekly charts which indicates strong positive sentiment for the medium to long term.  The momentum and technical indicators all point to the possibility of the prices moving higher towards the Rs 98.55 mark immediately. If level is breached, we might see the prices move towards the Rs 110 level eventually.  The stop loss for this trade setup would be Rs 85 levels on closing basis.

ITC,2021-09-30T21:23:26+05:30,2021-09-30,PTI,"India's agri exports can be doubled in 'medium term', says ITC Chairman","'I think the most important sector that we need to deal with is really the agriculture value chains. And to that I would also add the wood-based value chains as an opportunity,' Puri said. ","India accounts for only 2.5 per cent of the global agriculture exports, and there is an opportunity to double it in the medium term and improve the economics of the sector, ITC Chairman Sanjiv Puri on said on Thursday.  There is an urgent need to deal with the agriculture value chain, which would help in improving the quality of income in rural areas and ushering in socio-economic transformation in the country, Puri said while virtually addressing an event organised by industry body PHDCCI.  The sector also needs &quot;immediate and substantive transformation&quot; because it is also the most threatened by global climate change, he added.  &quot;I think the most important sector that we need to deal with is really the agriculture value chains. And to that I would also add the wood-based value chains as an opportunity,&quot; Puri said.  &quot;Presently, because of our productivity and limitations on quality, sustainability and limitations of value addition, India merely accounts for only two and a half per cent of the global exports,&quot; the ITC chairman said.  &quot;The opportunity is very clearly to be able to double it in the medium terms, and doubling this offers the opportunity to actually improve, and improve the economics of this sector,&quot; he said adding that it needs a lot of policy reforms.  Some has been already undertaken at the centre and states level on agri infrastructure, funds, regulations, the marketing linkages, etc, Puri noted.  &quot;What we have to envision is to move away from a production centric agriculture system to the next generation agriculture, which is demand-responsive,&quot; he said.  The dependence of the workforce on the agri value chains in India is also immense. Nearly two-thirds of rural livelihoods come from the sector and about half of the workforce of India is engaged in the sector.  &quot;Despite such a large workforce being engaged in agriculture, its share in the GDP is under 20 per cent, reflecting the endemic problems of productivity and low incomes. So, this is really a serious concern in terms of the quality of incomes here,&quot; he added.  The food processing industry which lies at the intersection of agriculture and active manufacturing is an &quot;enormous economic multipliers&quot; and has the best employment to capital ratios, Puri observed.  &quot;It is an industry which creates an enormous amount of post-harvest management livelihood. It also brings efficiencies, and also positively impacts farm incomes,&quot; Puri said.  According to him, agriculture is a sector threatened by climate change, though it is a small contributor to it.  &quot;We have witnessed the extreme weather events, year on year, and the devastation they have caused on many facets of economic activity, but certainly substantially to agriculture, and experts actually predict that by 2050, if climate change continues unabated in the trajectory that it is progressing today, extreme weather events will multiply 75 times,&quot; he added.  For example, wheat yields could drop by 50 per cent after climate change, he added.  Moreover, India is already a water stress country, with 54 per cent of the country falls in that.  According to Puri, agriculture is a sector, which has &quot;immense opportunity&quot;.  By 2050, the world is going to be home to 9 billion people and by 2027, India is going to be the most populous country with 1.5 billion people.  &quot;And by that time, people would have better incomes better consumption, and therefore the world would need an enormous amount of food to manage the requirements and India will be the largest arable land in the world and a leader in many commodities,&quot; he said adding it will have a &quot;unique opportunity to partake in the growing requirements and service of the world&quot;.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/indias-agri-exports-can-be-doubled-in-medium-term-says-itc-chairman-7528711.html,2,1.0

ITC,2021-09-17T08:09:40+05:30,2021-09-17,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"Trading Spotlight: What should investors do with ITC, IndusInd Bank and Avenue Supermarts?",Here's what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities Ltd recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today.,"Bulls are roaring again as the market had a strong run-up with benchmark indices hitting fresh record highs on September 16, extending uptrend for the third consecutive session, which is attributed to the government's announcement for telecom and auto sectors.  The BSE Sensex closed above 59,000 mark and Nifty50 above 17,600 levels for the first time, gaining 418 points and 110 points respectively, outperforming the broader markets which closed with moderate gains.  Among sectors, the Nifty Bank gained the most with 2.22 percent rally as PSU Bank index spiked 5.4 percent and Private Bank rose 2.67 percent, while FMCG and Financial Services rallied over a percent each.  Stocks that were in focus or action included cigarette-hotel-to-FMCG major ITC that rallied 6.83 percent to close at Rs 230.75, private sector lender IndusInd Bank, which rallied 7.34 percent to close at Rs 1,131.25. Also, hypermarket chain Avenue Supermarts shares hit a fresh record high of Rs 4,099 on Thursday, before closing with gains of 2.82 percent at Rs 4,094.35.  Here's what Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities Ltd, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  ITC  The stock has rallied over 7 percent on September 16. After a strong opening, the stock quickly surpassed Rs 220 medium-term resistance level with strong volume activity. Post breakout it maintained positive momentum throughout the day and succeeded to close above the same which is broadly positive for the ITC.  In the short term time frame, the stock has formed a strong price volume breakout pattern. The texture of the pattern suggests breakout action will continue in the near term if it succeeds to trade above Rs 220 level.  For the swing traders, Rs 220 would be the sacrosanct level, above the same, we can expect an uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 240-247.  IndusInd Bank  On September 16, the stock registered a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,186.50. In this month so far, it rallied over 13 percent, and on daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed a breakout continuation pattern which is grossly positive for IndusInd Bank.  However, on the intraday time frame, momentum indicators indicate the stock is in the overbought zone and high chances of quick short term price correction can not ruled out if stock trading below Rs 1,095.  For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,095 could be the trend decider level for the bulls. If it sustains above the same, we can expect a continuation of uptrend up to Rs 1,185.  Further uptrend may also continue which could lift the stock to Rs 1,225. On the flip side, dismissal of Rs 1,095 could possibly trigger a quick short term correction to Rs 1,040.  Avenue Supermarts  Post strong uptrend rally from Rs 3,600 to Rs 4,000, the stock was trading in a narrow range. But after a strong opening, bulls again took control and due to sharp incremental volume activity, it successfully clear the resistance of Rs 4,020.  On the weekly charts, the stock has formed a strong bullish candle which is broadly positive. Further, on daily charts, the stock has formed a higher bottom series pattern which suggests a strong bullish structure is likely to continue in the medium term.  For the positional traders, Rs 3,950 should be the key level to watch, if it manages to trade above the same, then we can expect an uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 4,300-4,500.

ITC,2021-09-16T15:20:14+05:30,2021-09-16,Sunil Shankar Matkar,"ITC, long-undervalued stock, jumps 8%; experts see strong returns amid recovery in FMCG, cigarettes","A laggard in the ongoing rally in the stock markets, ITC is also seen benefitting from attractive valuations, a strong product portfolio and unlocking of value from a possible restructuring, analysts say","ITC, a long-undervalued stock, surged as much as 8 percent on September 16 to the highest level in seven months, after a period of consolidation since the beginning of 2021. The stock climbed to a high of Rs 233.50 on the BSE, the highest since February 9. It had consolidated in a range of Rs 200-225 since February. The Nifty 50 has gained more than 25 percent and the FMCG index has jumped over 19 percent since the start of the calendar year. ITC, with interests in segments including fast moving consumer goods, hotels, cigarettes, agri-business and information technology, has added only 3.3 percent in the year ended September 15 and was the lowest gainer among Nifty FMCG stocks. Hindustan Unilever rallied 16 percent, Britannia Industries 14 percent and Dabur 19 percent in the same period. Attractive valuations, expected improvement in business outlook, lower lockdown impact on the FMCG and cigarette segments, a strong portfolio of FMCG brands, and the potential of value unlocking could be driving the stock, experts said. They advised investors to hold the stock for a couple of years, given the expected returns along with good dividend yield. “Today is the big payoff day for investors of the meme favourite and laggard stock – ITC,” said Aprajita Saxena, a research analyst at Trustline Securities. “This sudden rally is on the backdrop of expected improvement in business outlook for ITC. The stock was lagging behind in terms of performance. So, from a valuation perspective, this is one of the cheaper consumption-theme stocks in the FMCG space.” She said that according to information provided by company officials, there’s no ruling out the possibility of ITC restructuring its various businesses, including demerging the hotel division and the listing of ITC Infotech. ITC Hotels has more than 100 hotels in over 70 destinations. “This would be a value unlocking of hotels and other businesses. It is expected that the spun-off businesses would get a better valuation,” she said. Atish Matlawala, a senior analyst at SSJ Finance &amp;amp; Securities, said there could be many reasons for the sharp gain in ITC shares – it was one of the very few Nifty stocks that hadn’t participated in the rally, is attractively valued, and has a very good dividend yield of more than 5 percent. “ITC shares have been long undervalued in the market and it has not participated in the ongoing rally in the market, so the sudden jump in the stock prices was along expected lines,” said Ashis Biswas, head of technical research at CapitalVia Global Research. “The stock has seen a very small rise in prices compared to its peers in the rally.” What should investors do? Matlawala said ITC will give good returns over at least three years. “ITC has built a very strong portfolio of FMCG brands like Aashirvaad atta, Bingo!, Sunfeast, B Natural and Savlon. In the next few years, we believe this will be reflected in the financials,” he said. Saxena of Trustline said the reduced impact of pandemic-induced restrictions and the faster recovery trend seen in cigarettes are positives, while rising FMCG business profitability will offer an incremental upside potential. “If ITC is able to break the barrier of Rs 240, then the rally can be expected to continue till the level of Rs 265 in a small period of time,” said Biswas of CapitalVia.

The company plans to invest across its FMCG, hospitality, agriculture, education and stationery businesses, chairman and managing director Sanjiv Puri said at a press conference on August 12.  “We will be investing to expand our capacity, for example, as the sales of a particular category increase, we have to add regional lines. Similarly, we will invest in upgrading technology to remain contemporary. We have also identified new growth areas such as plastic substitutes, a super-app for farmers, and scaling up of food processing. All of these will have their investment plans,” said Puri.  ITC is also looking at inorganic opportunities across businesses for the next leg of growth. In FMCG, the company is scouting for acquisitions in the food and personal care segments, Puri told Moneycontrol.  “We have a wide portfolio in both food and personal care and we are open to looking at opportunities that are aligned to our strategic plan. We are looking at something that helps us address recent consumer trends and has a strategic fit with our existing businesses,” he said.  While addressing the company’s 110th annual general meeting, Puri shared the ‘ITC Next’ strategy and efforts being taken to drive growth in the years ahead. ITC plans to soon launch a super-app for farmers and is scaling up initiatives across the value chain to become a digital-first company.  Eye on HUL’s throne  ITC plans to dethrone Hindustan Unilever as the country’s top FMCG company and is making efforts on all fronts to achieve this goal. The company has identified potential growth areas across segments and plans to tap them by extending current brands such as Sunfeast and Aashirvaad or launching products. It’s also eyeing the inorganic route.  The company wants to tap consumer trends towards healthy eating and convenience foods. It has introduced ITC Master Chef Frozen Snacks in 120-125 towns and cities and initially aims to drive their adoption in these towns.  “Slowly, we will take the category wider but it will not go deeper quickly. We want to build it in markets where its penetration is low and hence there is tremendous headroom for growth,” said Puri.  At the same time, it is extending the Aashirvaad brand to cater to adjacent staples categories.  “Aashirvaad started as an atta (flour) brand and then we ventured into specialised atta. We have also launched gluten-free millet mixes, vermicelli and now we plan to launch ready-to-cook chapatis in Kerala under the brand,” he said.  Smart solutions for homes, health, wellness and hygiene, convenience foods, and indulgence foods are some growth areas that the company has identified.  Growing FMCG pie  ITC, of late, has been trying to shake off its image as a cigarette company, which has impacted its market performance. It has been pushing its FMCG business towards this end, which, according to the company, has yielded results.  The company’s FMCG unit garnered consumer spending of over Rs 22,000 crore and reached more than 150 million households in FY21, Puri told shareholders at the AGM on August 11.  According to Puri, the company’s EBITDA margins in its FMCG business in the past four years have improved by 640 basis points, while revenue increased to almost Rs 15,000 crore from about Rs 10,500 crore. In the past year, FMCG revenue recorded an industry-leading growth of about 16 percent on a comparable basis, he said.  The FMCG business’s gross revenue and profit after tax for FY21 stood at over Rs 48,000 crore and Rs 13,000 crore, respectively.  ITC faces several hurdles on its journey to becoming the top FMCG company in the country. Puri, too, acknowledged this.  “It takes a lot of effort, it takes a lot of resources and not just investments in the brand-building but also in research and development, innovation and to get the right kind of talent and distribution. So, it is not an easy business but quite challenging. But we have made progress so far and are the largest incubator of world-class Indian brands and we are optimistic of delivering good performance going ahead too,” he said.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/itc-to-invest-2-billion-to-create-vectors-for-next-leg-of-growth-cmd-sanjiv-puri-7323781.html,0,0.0

FMCG and paper segments, aided the rise in profit. The COVID-19 second wave had limited impact on the segments, compared to the first wave, the company said.","Better-than-expected cigarette sales lit up ITC’s first-quarter earnings for FY22 as the company reported a 37 percent jump in net revenue to Rs 12,217 crore as compared to Rs 8,911 crore reported in the corresponding period last year. Its net profit for the period stood at Rs 3,013.5 crore (standalone) -- a rise of 28.6 percent as opposed to Rs 2,343 crore in Q1FY21.  The growth in topline was largely led by the company’s cigarette, FMCG and paper segments. The second wave of COVID-19 had limited impact on the segments, especially when compared to the first wave, which coincided with the first quarter of FY21.  “Pandemic-led disruptions impacted most consumer companies but weighed heavily on ITC, which reported a sharp earnings decline in FY21. ITC enjoys a low-base benefit but the first-quarter performance has been sharply ahead, led by cigarettes (and paperboards),” brokerage firm Jefferies said in a note.  Cigarette sales recover  ITC’s revenue from the cigarette segment, its mainstay, jumped 33 percent during Q1FY22 to Rs 5,122 crore in comparison to Rs 3,854 crore a year ago. The company registered a 37 percent jump in earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) in Q1FY22 to Rs 3,221 crore.  Cigarette sales contributed 65 percent to ITC’s revenues.  The jump came on a low base as the first quarter of FY21 had witnessed a significant decline in sales due to the onset of COVID-19 and a nationwide lockdown.  “Cigarette EBIT was up 36.7 percent YoY in Q1FY22 on a weak base (38.8 percent decline in Q1FY21). However, it was still 16.2 percent lower than the Q1FY20 levels, and there is little indication of segmental EBIT growth returning to over 10 percent levels anytime soon,” Motilal Oswal Securities said in a note.  The company, however, informed that after severe disruptions in May, there has been week-on-week improvement in market conditions from mid-June, with most markets returning to normalcy and witnessing faster recovery compared to the first wave, consequent to the easing of restrictions, even as certain parts of Kerala, Odisha and the North-East remain partially impacted.  “The pace of volume recovery is better, compared to the previous wave of COVID-19, aided by improved mobility, distribution expansion, and new launches. Also, restrictions were not as severe as previous lockdowns,&quot; said Mehul Desai, Analyst, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.  ITC introduced several new cigarette variants, such as Gold Flake Excel, Wills Navy Cut Filter and Berkeley Hero, during the quarter, in focus markets. “Gold Flake Premium and Capstan Special 5’s packs were launched in line with evolving consumer preferences,” it said.  This, too, aided growth in the category.  FMCG category remains resilient  The FMCG category, which include several essential products, has helped the company tide over a difficult year. Though ITC registered over a 10 percent growth in FMCG in Q1FY22, it came over a high base of the corresponding period in FY21. Being essential in nature, FMCG had comparatively been less impacted by the first wave. Hoarding by consumers as the government announced lockdowns also led to a sales spike for several FMCG companies in the first quarter of FY22.  Its revenue from the segment stood at Rs 3,726 crore during the quarter as compared to Rs 3,375 crore in the year-ago period (Q1FY21). The FMCG EBITDA grew 16 percent YoY while EBIT was up 38 percent.  “The modest growth has been due to a high base of last year as categories like staple/foods benefited from pantry loading coupled with disruption in the current quarter,” said the note by Jefferies.  ITC had reported a 26 percent decline in net profit in Q1FY21 over Q1FY20, but its revenue from the FMCG segment had grown 10 percent YoY in the quarter as consumers scrambled to stock up essential products.  Despite continued growth in FMCG, ITC continues to draw the highest share of its revenue from cigarettes, a matter of concern for analysts.  “With the cigarettes business likely to contribute over 82 percent to ITC’s overall EBIT even in FY23E (from 85 percent in FY20), there is no material reduction in the dependence on this segment – which is beset by concerns of a) weak EBIT growth for several years now, b) the overhang of a possible GST increase. going forward, and c) ESG-related issues over tobacco, leading to a reduction in valuation multiples,” said Motilal Oswal Securities.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/itc-earnings-results-cigarette-business-recovery-low-base-covid-19-impact-7225231.html,0,0.0
ITC,2021-07-24T20:06:48+05:30,2021-07-24,Moneycontrol News,"ITC Q1 profit rises 28.6% to Rs 3,013.5 crore, revenue jumps 36.4% to Rs 12,959 crore",ITC said strong sequential recovery momentum in cigarettes led to volumes reaching nearly pre-Covid levels in Q4 FY21.,"Cigarette-FMCG-to-hotel major ITC on July 24 has reported a 28.6 percent year-on-year growth in standalone profit at Rs 3,013.5 crore in the quarter ended June 2021, partly driven by low base in the year-ago quarter. The Q1FY21 quarter was impacted by first wave of Covid-19.  Profit was at Rs 2,342.76 crore in corresponding period previous fiscal.  Revenue from operations in Q1FY22 increased 36.4 percent year-on-year to Rs 12,959.15 crore, and revenue (excluding excise duty) jumped 37.1 percent YoY to Rs 12,217.13 crore during the quarter. The topline was led by cigarettes, FMCG and paper segments.  &quot;Localised lockdowns and mobility restrictions imposed by States in a bid to contain the sharp increase in daily Covid-19 infections in the second wave rendered the operating environment during the quarter extremely challenging and impacted the strong recovery momentum witnessed in recent quarters. The situation continues to improve with the progressive easing of restrictions and increased mobility from mid-June 2021,&quot; said ITC.  Segmentwise Update  ITC said cigarette business registered a 32.9 percent year-on-year growth at Rs 5,122.19 crore and its earnings before interest &amp;amp; tax (EBIT) jumped 36.7 percent to Rs 3,220.94 crore in Q1FY22.  &quot;Strong sequential recovery momentum in cigarettes led to volumes reaching nearly pre-Covid levels in Q4 FY21, and the second wave caused disruptions in convenience store operations during the quarter,&quot; said ITC.  The company further said certain markets in Kerala, Odisha and North East remained partially impacted.  FMCG-Others segment's revenue grew by 10.4 percent to Rs 3,725.55 crore driven mainly by hygiene products, fragrances, spices, snacks, dairy and agarbattis, and EBIT shot up 38.3 percent to Rs 173 crore in Q1FY22, compared to corresponding period last fiscal.  &quot;In respect of FMCG-Others segment, EBITDA for the quarter ended June 2021 is Rs 298.73 crore, against Rs 257.34 crore in June quarter 2020,&quot; said ITC.  Hotels business reported a massive 463.5 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 127.24 crore as year-ago quarter impacted the business badly. ITC has narrowed its EBIT loss of hotels business to Rs 151.45 crore from Rs 242.58 crore in the same period.  &quot;After severe disruptions during the quarter, hotels business is rebounding with the easing of restrictions led by leisure destinations, staycations and weekend getaways. Structural cost management actions aid in mitigating impact,&quot; ITC reasoned.  Agri business segment revenue in Q1FY22 at Rs 4,091.27 crore grew by 9.2 percent driven by wheat, rice and leaf tobacco exports, leveraging strong customer relationships and robust sourcing network, YoY. And its EBIT at Rs 195.74 crore increased by 9.5 percent compared to corresponding period last fiscal.  Paperboards, paper and packaging segment registered a 54.2 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1,582.65 crore and 145.3 percent increase in EBIT at Rs 392.83 crore in the quarter ended June 2021.  The growth in paper business was driven by value added paperboards, décor paper and carton packaging, said ITC, adding significant improvement in profitability was driven by richer product mix, higher realisations on the back of surge in global pulp prices and structural cost saving interventions.  ITC said there was strong rebound across operating segments despite operational constraints in the wake of the second wave. Standalone earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) shot up 50.8 percent to Rs 3,992.16 crore compared to year-ago quarter.  Other income during the quarter fell 52.2 percent to Rs 428.99 crore.  ITC shares gained 1.6 percent in the current calendar year 2021, and climbed 6.4 percent in last one year to close at Rs 212.4.

There is heightened uncertainty around the timing and shape of the recovery trajectory of overall economic growth in India due to the virus, the company said in its Annual Report for 2020-21.  In terms of consumption, urban-led recovery may be relatively muted compared to the first wave as consumers switch to precautionary savings mode and rising healthcare costs eat into household spending, while rural demand may also be blunted by the large-scale spread of the virus to the hinterland in the second wave.  &quot;The severity of the second wave of COVID-19 infections in the country poses a key challenge and remains a key monitorable for the FMCG industry in the near-term,” the directors of the company said in the report.  Follow our LIVE blog for latest updates of the novel coronavirus pandemic  There is a perceptible shift with consumers adopting a more precautionary savings approach with resources being set aside for medical needs.  &quot;The spread of the virus to rural areas on a relatively higher scale as compared to the first wave, is also expected to weigh on industry growth outlook,” the report added.  Stating that ITC continues to monitor the &quot;evolving situation”, the company said it &quot;will respond with agility to enhance its market standing while managing risks associated with the heightened uncertainties in the business environment.”  While the supply chain is fully operational, constraints in the number of operating outlets and limited hours of operation continue to pose front-end challenges for the FMCG industry, it added.  &quot;Recent learnings in dealing with the pandemic spanning sales and distribution, supply chain operations, innovation and product development will continue to be leveraged in this regard,” the company said.  Commenting on the country’s economic growth prospects, the company said while earlier estimates of India’s GDP growth for 2021-22 ranged between 11 percent to 13 percent, &quot;the ferocity of the second wave in India since February, 2021 has adversely impacted economic prospects”.  &quot;High frequency indicators point to economic activity having fallen by (around) 25-30 percent from nearly pre-COVID levels in February-March 2021. This has led to sharp downward revisions to the earlier growth projections by 200 to 300 basis points,” the company’s annual report said.  Stating that &quot;there is heightened uncertainty around the timing and shape of the recovery trajectory”, ITC said, &quot;a rapid scale up in the pace of vaccination and gearing up of the healthcare infrastructure to mitigate the impact of possible future outbreaks would be critical going forward.”  On the consumption side, ITC said, &quot;urban-led recovery may be relatively muted compared to the first wave as consumers switch to precautionary savings mode and rising healthcare costs eat into household spending.”  The report further said, &quot;rural demand, which remained strong in FY 2020-21, on the back of robust agricultural output, government support and reverse migration, may also be blunted by the large-scale spread of the virus to the hinterland in the second wave.”  On the other hand, ITC said &quot;less severe restrictions, a more prepared organised sector and a pick-up in vaccination coverage present some of the key mitigating factors going forward”.  Robust recovery in advanced economies and other emerging markets could provide the much needed tailwind from an external demand perspective, it added.  The company, however, said even as the Indian economy faces multi-dimensional challenges in the short term, &quot;it remains one of the most dynamic major economies in the world with huge potential”.  &quot;With structural drivers of growth firmly in place, the pace of economic growth is expected to pick up over time,” the report added.

ITC,2021-06-08T12:54:02+05:30,2021-06-08,Ashish Kyal,Stuck with ITC? Here's why the stock is a tough bet to play,ITC can continue to meander in a range of Rs 220–200 for now and positive traction can be witnessed on this stock post July 14. Read on to know what changes in July that can trigger an up move in the stock,"ITC stock has been a major underperformer since March 2021.  There have been many memes circulating with ITC being labelled as an “immovable asset”. It is interesting to see that so many investors or traders are now stuck in this stock and it is simply testing their patience.  It is best to apply Time Cycles to understand the possible reversal dates and also the probable pattern under formation in the stock.  Below is the chart of ITC with Hurst’s Time Cycles    We can clearly see that the stock is forming classic lows near around 55 days Hurst’s Time cycle and reversing back on upside from there. Since March 2021, majority of the lows are around this cycle dates.  However, the desired momentum is not seen. As of now we can see that the stock is now moving to the second half of the cycle which is usually the sell mode. The chances getting bleak for the stock to rally with each passing day until the next cycle low kicks in which is likely only post 14th July 2021.  This means that there is high probability traders and investors who are stuck in ITC might have to wait for more than a month before some action starts. Also, the overall pattern is also forming the shape of topping Head &amp;amp; Shoulder with neckline near 200 levels. Any breach below it might result into panic among traders and there can be some serious selloff that can then kick in until July 14.  For any momentum to gather on upside we need to see the stock breaking above Rs 220 decisively with strong momentum but with cycle entering into the sell mode it might be tough bet to play with.  In a nutshell, ITC can continue to meander in a range of Rs 220–200 for now and positive traction can be witnessed on this stock post July 14, 2021. Traders or investors should be careful once Rs 200 is taken out as that can kick in real panic across.

ITC,2021-06-07T08:01:35+05:30,2021-06-07,Gaurav Choudhury,"In strategic shift from tobacco, FMCG now increasingly powering ITC’s growth",ITC appears to be increasingly looking at acquisitions in FMCG to accelerate growth. The company’s presentation clearly identifies ‘value accretive M&amp;A’ as one of its strategic pillars to grow the FMCG business. ,"Diversified conglomerate ITC appears to have identified the rapidly expanding fast-moving-consumer-goods (FMCG) segment as its main growth driver, with financials showing encouraging performance in the group’s overall matrix.  The latest fourth quarter and full year results for 2020-21 show some interesting trends. Revenues from the FMCG business (ex-tobacco) grew 16 percent for ITC in 2020-21 compared with a peer group average of 8 -9 percent. The comparative figures stand out even more on a quarter-on-quarter sequential basis over the last four quarters.  In the first quarter of 2020-21,  ITC’s FMCG segment revenues grew 19 percent compared with a decline of about 2 percent reported by the peer group.; followed by 15 percent in the second quarter against peer group average of around 8  percent. In the third quarter, ITC’s FMCG business segment grew 11 percent compared with an industry average of around 10 percent.  It is only in the fourth quarter that the industry average growth of 20 percent outperformed ITC’s FMCG business growth of 16 percent. This is mainly because of a low base—peer-group revenues had fallen (-) 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019-20 compared with  ITC’s 5 percent growth in the segment revenues on a comparable basis.  For The Future  ITC 2.0, under new chairman Sanjiv Puri, who completes two years at the helm of the tobacco-to-hotels conglomerate, is turning out to be a story of a major improvement of the FMCG business with a sharper focus on innovation, bold acquisitions, and impactful marketing campaigns.  A disaggregated analysis points towards a strategic tilt towards FMCG in recent years, with consistent improvement in margins - a key concern over the years.  Sample this.  Between 2017-18 and 2020-21, earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins in the FMCG segment have improved by 500 basis points. In 2020-21, the EBIDTA margin stood at 9 per cent, up 180 basis points over the previous year.  The company appears to be shedding its traditionalist approach on acquisitions in the FMCG space, which may well hold pointers of what could be coming. ITC appears to be increasingly looking at acquisitions in the FMCG space to accelerate growth. The company’s presentation clearly identifies ‘value accretive M&amp;amp;A’ as one of its strategic pillars to grow the FMCG business.  Acquisitions Are The Way  The company’s quarterly presentation clearly identifies “value-accretive M&amp;amp;A” as one of its strategic pillars to grow the FMCG business.  In May last year, it announced the decision to acquire Kolkata-based spice maker Sunrise Foods Pvt. Ltd (Sunrise), seen as part of a broader strategy to fortify its position in the country’s highly competitive FMCG market.  The acquisition, which was completed in July, involved buying out Sunrise in an all-cash deal of Rs 2,150 crore.  Recent acquisitions such as Savlon and Nimyle have added product strength to ITC’s FMCG business portfolio.  ITC acquired Savlon from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson in 2015, foraying into the disinfectant and antiseptic products market. Savlon crossed Rs 1,000 crore in consumer spends in 2020-21, from Rs 250 crore in the previous year, making it the largest brand in the company’s personal care products portfolio, overtaking Vivel.  What has driven this performance in the (ex-tobacco) FMCG segment? The company’s quarterly presentation holds some clues.

People are more conscious about the products they are consuming, especially food, forcing packaged food and beverage companies to re-examine strategies.  The recent developments in the FMCG industry — Nestle acknowledging that about 60 percent of its products are unhealthy and Amul-PETA vegan row— show that the discourse on “health” has gone mainstream in India. This is a radical shift as Indian consumers were perceived to be value or cost-conscious by businesses.  Amul vs PETA  The standoff between Amul and People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) took an ugly turn earlier this week after the milk cooperative’s former vice chairman Valamji Humbal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to ban the non-governmental organisation.  While the recent flashpoint has been an advertisement by Amul, it all started when the country’s largest dairy brand objected to companies labelling plant-based beverages as milk.  At the core is the global discourse on vegan, vegetarian and non-vegetarian lifestyles and which is more eco-friendly. The two sides—the dairy industry and PETA that advocates a plant-based lifestyle —claim their products are healthier.  Watch this space, as the last word has not been said in this battle.

According to a report by the UK-based newspaper The Financial Times, the presentation, which was shared among the company’s top executives earlier this year, said only 37 percent of Nestle’s food and beverages by revenues, excluding products such as pet food and specialised medical nutrition, achieve a rating above 3.5 under Australia’s health star rating system.

However, with the second wave of Covid, we expect some impact on the performance of cigarettes, discretionary FMCG portfolio as well as hotels and paper divisions. Better traction in health, hygiene and essential food portfolio could offset some of the decline. Post Covid, we expect segments like Hotel, paper and packaging to witness growth with healthy profitability. Going forward, the concern remains whether ITC will be able to maintain and increase its market share in the cigarette business in the face of competition and cheaper imports. Based on the FY22E and FY23E earnings, ITC is trading at a P/E multiple of 17x and 16x, respectively. Despite its huge discount to the FMCG universe, ethical considerations have prompted some long-only investors to avoid ITC.

With the number of COVID-19 patients rising, this demand is expected to rise. Moloy Banerjee, head of gases - South Asia of Linde Plc, one of the largest industrial gas companies in the world and a major supplier of oxygen in India, believes that distribution remains the bigger challenge for producers across the country. He added that the current production in the country is enough to meet the demand.  Linde – through its affiliates Linde India and Praxair India – is in the process of ramping up production in India. Linde has a combined capacity of more than 2000 metric tonnes per day (MTPD), while India’s overall production is around 9,000 MTPD now.  Edited Excerpts  Q. India is facing an unprecedented oxygen crisis. What is Linde India’s contribution to tide over the situation?  A: Linde India Limited and Praxair India Pvt. Ltd. are subsidiaries of Linde Plc. and collectively, are one the leading suppliers of medical oxygen. In addition to optimizing our operations to maximize output and diverting our industrial redirect supplies of oxygen from most industries to healthcare services, we are working on several large-scale initiatives in cooperation with the Government of India, relevant authorities, and industry partners at a national level to address the current crisis.  Our main focus is currently on increasing supply and improving distribution efficiency, and thankfully many such measures are already in place. For example, Linde is working with various partners to urgently import cryogenic ISO containers from different international locations to India. We are also converting liquid argon and liquid nitrogen tankers to liquid oxygen instead, as well as building new/augmenting existing capacities installations at various partner hospitals. Our teams are working round the clock to ensure that delivery is not interrupted.  Q. Is the availability of oxygen or supply-side bottleneck the real issue behind the current oxygen shortage in India?  A: The rise in oxygen demand is much higher compared to last year. However, the current demand can be met with the volume manufactured collectively in India. But this volume is not available uniformly across the country and the demand is higher in certain parts of India compared to others. Hence, distribution remains the bigger challenge to solve to address the issue of oxygen shortage. As discussed in the third quarter, distribution bottleneck is currently the primary challenge.  Linde India and Praxair India collectively manage and operate several plants with Air Separation and manufacturing capabilities. These plants currently have a combined capacity of more than 2,000 metric tonnes per day (MTPD) and are located across India.  Q. You tied up with Tata Group and ITC to make cryogenic tanks available across the country. What is your strategy in this regard?  A: Linde India is already in the process of importing Cryogenic containers available from SE Asia &amp;amp; the Middle East. We are also exploring other geographies for the availability of cryogenic containers.  Linde is collaborating with various Indian industry partners to transport ISO cryogenic tankers from across the region to India. These containers can carry up to 20 tons of Liquid Oxygen over long distances, and upon arrival, the containers will be conditioned and certified for liquid medical oxygen transport from Linde facilities. The tankers can also act as interim oxygen storages in remote areas that are facing oxygen scarcity.  Q. Are you looking at further tie-ups to ensure the availability of such tankers?  A: The company is currently having discussions with other stakeholders and industry partners so that more containers and necessary equipment can be brought into the country. Linde is in the process of ramping up production in India through its affiliates Linde India and Praxair India All collaborations that lead to productive solutions to combat this pandemic is much needed and welcome now – we are having discussions with various stakeholders and industry partners for possible partnerships in providing greater support to the nation  Q. How effective is the role being played by EG II in terms of coming out of this crisis?  A: As part of Empowered Group 2 (EG2), we are closely working with the Government of India to produce and supply medical oxygen to various parts of the country. All possible efforts are being undertaken to address supply and transportation challenges and we are thankful to our international counterparts and industry partners for providing the necessary support.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/interview-solving-oxygen-crisis-distribution-bottleneck-primary-challenge-says-moloy-banerjee-head-gases-linde-south-asia-6851191.html,2,2.0
