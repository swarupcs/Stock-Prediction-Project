In addition, the conglomerate, which is into oil refining, telecommunications and retail, is also facing unfriendly tax proposals that could hit its businesses.Shares of the company have slid almost 8% since reaching a record high in mid-December. A spokesman for RIL declined to comment. Here are four challenges the company is facing:Aramco deal delay:Mukesh Ambani told shareholders in August that RIL would sell 20% of its oil and petrochemicals unit to Aramco in a deal valuing the business at $75 billion. The sale is crucial to reduce the group’s net debt, which was about $22 billion at the end of March 2019.But in December, the government requested a court to stop the proposed sale to help ensure the Mumbai-based company has enough assets to pay claims in an arbitration case related to profit sharing and royalty payments between Reliance Industries and its partners. RIL says the government’s plea isn’t tenable legally and should be dismissed.RIL expected to complete the Aramco transaction by March 2020 subject to due diligence and regulatory approvals, but said in January that although the talks with Aramco were making “good progress,” a definitive pact is still a few months away. The talks have gathered pace in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.Income tax (I-T) investigation:The tax department has widened a probe to find whether some Ambani family members have evaded tax, according to people familiar with the matter. The conglomerate has denied that they have dodged taxes.The investigation is based on information the government received from French authorities in 2011 about 700 Indians who had accounts at HSBC Holdings Plc’s Swiss branches, the people said, asking not to be named citing rules.While tax probes are common in India and are, in many cases, driven by politics, the country’s richest family becoming the subject of an investigation is unprecedented and has surprised many. Ambani is Asia’s richest person, with a net worth of about $58 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.A spokesperson for the tax department didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.Protective tariff scrapped:Reliance Industries, the country’s largest producer of a chemical used to make polyester yarn, will face more competition in the segment after a proposed cut in import duties for purified terephthalic acid. In her February 1 budget speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government is getting rid of the duty to help ensure the easy availability of the commodity at competitive prices.Tax on investment trusts:The government has also proposed a change to dividend distribution tax, a step that could slow efforts of companies, including Reliance Industries, to raise funds through selling units in investment trusts.The conglomerate has been trying to raise funds and pare debt by selling a stake in trusts that hold its telecom towers and optical-fiber network.The change in rules will curtail returns for investors in the trusts by forcing them to add dividends to their total income and paying tax. The impact of higher tax for unit holders may make equity raising challenging, according to Shubham Jain, a senior vice president at ICRA Ltd, the local unit of Moody’s Investors Service.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mukesh-ambanis-plans-to-make-reliance-industries-debt-free-hit-multiple-snags/articleshow/74278747.cms,1

The country is in the middle of a major digital transformation and organisations like Jio have played a big part in getting hundreds of millions of Indian people and small businesses online.This is especially important right now, because small businesses are the core of every economy and they need our support.

All of us at Reliance are therefore humbled by the opportunity to welcome Facebook as our long-term partner in continuing to grow and transform the digital ecosystem of India for the benefit of all Indians.

And local retailers are at the heart of it as well. The local arm of the Seattle-based e-tailer said it has on-boarded 5,000 offline retailers across categories on its platform under what it calls 'Local Shops'. Started as a pilot six months back, local standalone stores selling grocery, consumer electronics ,apparel and other products are live on Amazon across metro and non-metro markets like Delhi, Mumbai,Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Coimbatore, Surat, Indore and Lucknow. This also includes relatively better known retailers like Sangeetha Electronics, Croma, Vishal Megamart among others.The local stores selling online would also fulfill most of the deliveries on their own as they would be enabled with Amazon's technology to serve local orders first based on pin-codes where they can deliver the same day or next day. If a retailer is willing to sell nationally, they will be able to sell through Amazon’s fulfillment services. Gopal Pillai, head of seller services, Amazon India, said the company would be committing about Rs 10 crore for the Local Shops programme to scale it up further. “This would leverage the best of local stores and Amazon’s network. Local stores are known for fast deliveries within short distances while Amazon’s wide reach would bring more traffic to these retailers, who have good stock availability. A retailer can choose to deliver certain pincodes on its own or by hiring a third-party, and rest can be done through Amazon---in a different part of the same city or other cities,” Pillai said. In light of ongoing lockdown due to the virus outbreak, this could plug the drop in footfall at stores partially, at least, he added. Over the last one month, kiranas and local shops have come to the rescue of Indian consumers as the lockdown crippled the supply chain of essentials across large-scale retail stores while online platforms struggled to fulfill rising demand of essentials. On Wednesday Ambani said nearly 3 crore kiranas in the near future will be able to transact digitally with their consumers in their neighbourhood through JioMart -- the new commerce platform which it has already launched in Mumbai's suburbs like Navi Mumbai and Thane. The orders are expected to be placed through WhatsApp. This is being seen as a potential game-changer for how online-to-offline (O2O) commerce could work. With Amazon’s serious play, going forward, this space would see an intense action. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, earlier in January, announced a $1 billion investment in India to digitise small and medium businesses by 2025. The company has already invested over $7 billion in this market. TOI reported on Thursday saying Reliance has already started roping in kiranas in its network by offering them merchandise, working capital loans, and digital payment solutions, including point-of-sale (PoS) machines.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-rils-kirana-play-amazon-moves-to-woo-neighbourhood-stores/articleshow/75323461.cms,2

The online-to-offline (O2O) commerce initiative could potentially change the landscape of retail, given WhatsApp’s reach of over 400 million customers in India.Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani said nearly 3 crore kiranas in the near future will be able to transact digitally with their consumers in their neighbourhood through JioMart — the new commerce platform, which it has already launched in Mumbai’s suburbs like Navi Mumbai and Thane. The orders are expected to be placed through WhatsApp, while Reliance had already started roping in kiranas in its network by offering them merchandise, working capital loans, and digital payment solutions, including point-of-sales (PoS) machines.  75307566The idea is to make the best of the “high-quality front end” of WhatsApp and Jio’s feet-on-the-street execution. “With this partnership what WeChat has done in China becomes a possibility. Facebook is a technology company and is not into handling logistics or moving goods, very clearly what they wanted was a partner who can handle all of it,” said a person involved in the transaction.  The mini-apps inside messaging app WeChat, which has 1.15 billion users, did business of $115 billion in 2019 in China across online retail, food delivery, ride-hailing, paying bills and booking tickets. Besides tie-ups with kiranas, Reliance has 11,316 stores across consumer electronics, fashion & lifestyle, and grocery (as of December quarter). The development comes as consumers, amid the virus outbreak, are starting to warm up to the idea of ordering essentials from their local shops through individual WhatsApp chats, albeit at a small scale.“They have started work on WhatsApp collaboration. While Ajio (fashion and lifestyle) is fully operating on the O2O model, Reliance is in the process of taking it to the wider retail businesses in other segments. The O2O model, where supply is linked with the inventory at nearby retail stores and not large warehouses, works better with unstructured categories, like grocery and other essentials,” a person aware of Reliance’s O2O plans said.Grocery is a thin-margin business and the model should be scalable, which has led to multiple pilots in different cities across the country, this person added.  75308253The cautious approach is preceded by on-ground challenges that companies in India have faced while trying the O2O model in the country. It hasn’t got the kind of traction that it did in China. “The opportunity is immense but the execution at every small store is critical. The demand pattern is different across cities and stocking adequately in right locations is a challenge. This would impact the timing of delivery — which is important for day-to-day items,” said a senior e-commerce executive who has worked on this model.All said, the final interface of JioMart and WhatsApp would play a differentiator as consumers are used to the easy-to-use design of how WhatsApp messaging works. To bring chat-based commerce and customer services, it would be a challenge to keep the design framework simple.Reliance’s bullishness on the model is further seen in a spate of acquisitions — Fynd, an O2O startup that was backed by Google; Grab, a hyper-local logistics company, and chatbot platform Haptik, among others.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-plans-to-bring-kiranas-closer-to-you/articleshow/75306938.cms,2

RIL’s debt has ballooned to $43 billion (Rs 3.06 lakh crore) following its aggressive entry into the telecom sector four years ago. It has invested more than Rs 3.50 lakh crore in building digital infrastructure which included splurging on acquisitions. In the recent past, concerns were raised about RIL’s mounting liabilities but the company debunked those by saying it has a clear roadmap for debt reduction. Read also: Level the field — News producers can’t keep incurring costs while digital platforms drain away profitsAt the annual shareholder meet last year, Ambani announced plans to make RIL a “zero net debt” company by March 31, 2021. But, legal roadblocks, among other factors, have hindered his asset monetisation deals. Last August, RIL had said that it will complete the $15 billion investment by Saudi Aramco by March but a closure to the deal seems to be away.  75314658Analysts believe that RIL is on track to reduce its net debt this fiscal after Jio Platforms’ deal with Facebook and its fuel retail joint venture (JV) with BP got the European Union regulator’s approval on Monday. RIL will receive Rs 7,000 crore from BP in lieu of the 49% stake in the JV and the deal is expected to be closed this quarter.  75307566“The two transactions will accelerate RIL’s deleveraging story and give the company more time to work in closing other deals involving Aramco and Brookfield (in telecom towers),” said Narendra Solanki, head-equity research, Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers. RIL is also looking to unlock value in its entertainment channel business and has held talks with Sony Corporation for the same. RIL has a net debt of Rs 1.53 lakh crore ($20 billion) and according to foreign brokerage firm CLSA, the company’s net debt will come down by 20% in this quarter. “Leverage is getting more manageable and concerns around this should diminish,” wrote CLSA in its report post the Facebook-Jio Platforms announcement. Of the total $5.7 billion investment by Facebook, Jio Platforms will retain $2.14 billion (Rs 15,000 crore), while the remaining $4.08 billion (Rs 28,574 crore) will be used to retire debt it owes to RIL. “The Facebook deal will be a major cash boost for RIL since the current uncertainties in the crude oil market may cast a shadow on its deal with Aramco,” said Rajeev Shah, MD, RBSA Advisors.

The Facebook investment values Jio Platforms--which runs apps like JioSaavn and JioCinema and holds investments in Reliance Jio Infocomm, operator of the world’s third largest mobile services network—at $57 billion (and $66 billion based on Reliance’s assumption of an exchange rate of Rs 70/$).If Jio Platforms were to be listed today, it would be the fifth most valued company in India after RIL, TCS, Hindustan Unilever and HDFC Bank. It is valued higher than India’s second and third largest technology companies - Infosys and Wipro - combined. Jio Platforms will also be 70% more valuable than its closest rival Bharti Airtel, which had a closing market capitalisation of Rs 2.73 lakh crore on Wednesday.In October 2019, RIL consolidated the digital platform business under a separate subsidiary to mirror the structure of global companies like Alphabet-Google, Tencent and Alibaba which are largely debt-free, making it easier to attract investors into the new entity.75312727The RIL-FB transaction has been in the works since last year, with the first few meetings between the top teams including Ambani and Zuckerbeg revolving around understanding the potential areas of business collaboration. The conversations progressed with the initial target of closing the deal on March 31. But the outbreak of Covid-19 delayed the final lap of due-diligence.Facebook will get a board seat and an “observer seat” on Jio Platforms. The deal is a binding agreement, according to RIL, but will need approval from antitrust watchdog Competition Commission of India. The announcement boosted RIL’s shares to close at Rs 1,363.6, up by 10.2% on the NSE. The deal will also see a tie-up between RIL’s retail unit and Facebook’s WhatsApp to leverage each other's platforms to allow consumers to order items from their local kirana stores. This would enable Facebook to monetise its large user base, while also potentially serve as a platform to drive adoption of its payment business under WhatsApp which will compete with Google Pay, Alibaba and Softbank-backed Paytm and Walmart-owned Phonepe.“India has more than 60 million small businesses and millions of people rely on them for jobs. With communities around the world in lockdown, many of these entrepreneurs need digital tools they can rely on to find and communicate with customers and grow their businesses,” Zuckerberg said.Ambani, said industry observers, wants Jio to be known as a digital services platform like US-based Google and China’s Alibaba, and not just as a telecom player.

All of us have remote access and most records are today stored digitally. And therefore, while it is obviously not the same as working in the office, I guess we in the finance world are lucky that we can work from home and can operate with a great deal of efficiency,"" Balakrishnan told PTI in an interview over telephone.Bank of America Merrill Lynch has managed a number of equity and debt market deals in India in the recent past, including SBI Card IPO, HDFC Life block deal, Avenue Supermarts share placements and a US debt placement worth $310 million for Adani Transmission.Globally, it has helped Petronas and Carnival Cruises raise funds, among other big deals.Giving a perspective about the lockdown and its impact on investment banking business globally and in India, Balakrishnan said most of the world is under lockdown right now and China is the only place where people have started coming back to office, but they went into lockdown in January itself and they are getting back after more than three months.""We (in India) have been under lockdown for only one month,"" he said.The veteran investment banker said while markets corrected significantly, most companies across the world went out and drew down their credit lines and improved their liquidity positions.Secondly, as soon as markets started falling, bond markets almost shut down for a while after a very strong bond market activity through January and February, he said.""But, the bond market rallied quickly around the middle of March. Through the second half of March and April, we had a very strong period for global investment grade bonds. Highly rated companies with investment grade ratings, went out and tapped the bond market and raised liquidity. So, after drawing on revolving credit lines, bond market fund raising happened,"" he said.Similarly, deal activity began in the US and spread to Europe and then to other places. Last week, Bank of America helped Petronas -- despite the stress in oil prices -- successfully raise $6 billion from the bond market. This indicates that for a quality issuer, even for a hard hit sector, a large bond offering even now, Balakrishnan said.He further said the leveraged finance market has also begun seeing a revival, while companies have started raising equity and doing other equity-linked transactions.""One major transaction Bank of America did in this space recently is for a US-based cruise company, Carnival Cruises,"" he said.""In India, we have had an excellent run in the last four months. In March, we successfully reopened the Indian equity capital markets by pricing a $300 million block trade in HDFC Life for Standard Life Aberdeen on a sole basis.""Also, we helped SBI Cards raise $1.4 billion via an IPO, which was the largest in the last ten years. In February also, we had helped D-Mart raise over $1 billion through a QIP and an OFS route,"" he said.Balakrishnan said many companies are right now waiting to declare their results and after that they will look to raise funds through equity or bonds and shore up their capital structure. At the same time, M&A dialogues continue as companies evaluate assets and deals which are of strategic importance.""Deals which made strategic sense before COVID-19 will do so even after COVID-19 too,"" he added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/all-locked-down-but-dealmakers-ensure-show-must-go-on-billion-dollar-deals-aplenty-for-right-biz/articleshow/75413360.cms,2

In contrast, Reliance Trends, which is into more affordable products, can use the Facebook platform to reach out to more consumers.”Questionnaires emailed to Reliance Retail and Facebook did not elicit responses till the time of going to the press.Commenting on the deal, for which Facebook is paying around $5.7 billion for buying 10% in the digital arm of Reliance, a Credit Suisse report on Monday said the partnership could later be extended into other retail categories such as medicine distribution, fashion & lifestyle stores and food delivery, as the Jio investment signals social media giant’s intention of capturing India’s vast ecommerce potential.The investment provides Facebook with a chance to onboard the large small and medium businesses and drive ecommerce via the JioMart venture, the report showed.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/jio-facebook-alliance-may-go-beyond-kirana-stores/articleshow/75419265.cms,0

The company has not disclosed the amount of money it plans to raise through the rights offer, or any other details about it.Through a stock exchange notice on Monday, RIL said its board will meet on April 30 to “consider a proposal to issue equity shares to existing shareholders on rights basis”. Early this month, RIL had said that the board had approved a proposal to raise Rs 25,000 crore through non-convertible debentures (NCDs).RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani will lead a board meeting on Thursday to consider the proposal of issuing new shares to existing shareholders, currently numbering over 23 lakh, according to data from the BSE. Ambani and his family owns 50% in RIL, which currently has a market capitalisation of nearly Rs 9.1 lakh crore.  75416764During rights offers, the promoters can avoid diluting their stake in the company by subscribing to their share of quota in the offer. In case other shareholders do not subscribe to their individual quota, even those shares could be bought by existing shareholders, including the promoters.The RIL’s rights issue proposal comes days after it inked India’s largest FDI deal, in the technology sector, with social media giant Facebook to raise Rs 43,574 crore by selling 9.9% in Jio, its digital platform business. Analysts see the rights issue proposal as RIL’s move to reduce its debt of $43 billion further. RIL had also planned to use the proceeds from the sale of its stake in Jio Platforms to deleverage its balance sheet.The last time RIL tapped the public for funds was in 1991 when it had issued convertible debentures. The debentures were subsequently converted into equity shares at Rs 55 apiece.Apart from the rights issue proposal, the board of RIL will also consider the financial statements of the $90-billion explorations-to-telecom company. Fiscal 2020’s fourth quarter results of RIL’s core business could be impacted as demand for transportation fuels have slumped due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Retail (specifically grocery) and telecom could see limited impact because of the increased consumption during the lockdown.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-to-finalise-first-rights-offer-in-29-years-on-apr-30/articleshow/75416765.cms,2

The fund’s investment in Jio Platforms establishes a new pricing benchmark for the Indian company that will see more external investors in the coming months. In its quarterly earnings commentary on April 30, RIL said that it has received interest from multiple global investors to buy additional stakes in Jio Platforms and that it would announce investments similar to the Facebook transaction. In that context, though the Silver Lake investment is positive, the size is very small compared to the Facebook deal and hence investors would like to see more marquee transactions in Jio Platforms, wrote analysts at JP Morgan in their research report. While RIL has not specified the total quantum of stake it intends to sell in Jio Platforms to outside parties, the share sales form part of chairman Mukesh Ambani’s broader plan to take the unit public in the future. Last October, RIL placed the entire digital and telecom assets in its 100% arm Jio Platforms in order to bring in external investors. Foreign investors now have a holding of 11.14% in Jio Platforms, a startup launched in late 2016 and that has become a force to reckon within the telecommunications industry with 388 million subscribers. The digital services business earned an operating profit of Rs 14,363 crore on an annual revenue of Rs 68,462 crore—up 64% and 41% from fiscal 2019. RIL has launched an aggressive programme to augment its balance sheet, which includes stake sales in its subsidiaries, rights offering and slowing down on fresh investments. The nation’s most valued enterprise, which is shifting its positioning from an energy-driven player to a consumer/technology-focused company, has a debt of Rs 3.36 lakh crore as on March 31, 2020. Ambani had said that he plans to make RIL a net debt-free company by the end of this financial year. Founded in 1999, Silver Lake, which manages assets worth $40 billion, places its bet mainly on technology and tech-enabled opportunities. The fund has investments in Dell Technologies, Twitter, Airbnb and Alibaba, to name a few. Its portfolio of investments collectively generates an annual revenue of over $230 billion and employs 3.7 lakh people worldwide. “Silver Lake has an outstanding record of being a valuable partner for leading technology companies globally. We are excited to leverage insights from their global technology relationships for the Indian digital society’s transformation,” said RIL chairman Ambani. Jio Platforms is Silver Lake’s third deal in the past one month after online travel booking firm Expedia and home-renting company Airbnb. “Jio Platform’s incredibly strong and entrepreneurial management team have brought extraordinary engineering capabilities to bear on bringing the power of low-cost digital services to a mass consumer and small businesses population. The market potential they are addressing is enormous, and we are honoured and pleased to have been invited to partner with Mukesh Ambani and the team at Reliance and Jio,” said Silver Lake Co-CEO Egon Durban.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-fb-us-firm-to-pay-750m-for-1-2-stake-in-jio/articleshow/75544478.cms,0

The deal may see Reliance, through one of its subsidiaries, pay $130-150 million for the asset, which may also include a fresh infusion to expand the operations, said one of the sources mentioned earlier. “The deal is happening at a slight premium to their last funding round valuation,” said the source. Netmeds, which started operations in 2015, has till date announced three rounds of funding totalling about $100 million. The company was started by Pradeep Dadha, whose family was one of the first distributors for Sun Pharmaceuticals. The distribution business was later acquired by Sun Pharma. Besides Dadha’s family office, the Netmeds backers include healthcare investor OrbiMed, investment bank MAPE Advisory, Sistema Asia Fund and Singapore-based Daun Penh Cambodia Group. “As a policy, we do not comment on media speculation and rumours. Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis,” said a Reliance spokesperson, adding that it will inform exchanges according to Sebi on any developments.  75564361“It would not be productive to comment on media speculations at this stage,” said Dadha in an emailed response, while adding that Netmeds has tied up with Reliance Retail for supplying essentials like groceries to its customers.The conversations between Reliance and Netmeds, which had also held talks with Walmart-owned Flipkart, had been going on before the coronavirus lockdown, sources said. This will be the second major move by Reliance in the pharma sector as last year it acquired 82% in Bengaluru-based C-Square Info Solutions, which makes software for distributors, retailers and sales force in the pharma sector, for a total of Rs 82 crore. Some of the clients of the company include Apollo Pharmacy, Adcock Ingram and other players. The development comes as Reliance is ramping up it’s online-to-offline (O2O) commerce business, first with grocery with the tie-up between Reliance Retail and WhatsApp last month. That deal came after WhatsApp’s parent company Facebook agreed to invest $5.7 billion for a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms, the telecom and digital services business of Reliance. Netmeds generates 90% of its revenue from prescription medicine and over-the-counter drugs. This is similar to other medicine delivery platforms like 1MG, Medlife and Pharmeasy who drive 80-90% of their revenue from selling medicine, focused on chronic customers who make repeat purchases regularly. Last year, Netmeds announced it would add a dozen new warehouses to take the total to 26 as it expanded across India. A RedSeer report in February said it has a base of 6 lakh monthly transacting users. According to the RedSeer report, a market research firm, the e-pharma industry, including consultancy and diagnostics, is about $1.2 billion. This is expected to reach about $16 billion in five years. While over 4 million households were already opting for buying medicine online, this space has become one of the few beneficiaries of the virus outbreak as more consumers are opting to buy medicine online. By the middle of March, e-pharmacy platforms saw a strong spike in sales of masks and sanitisers. 1MG co-founder and CEO Prashant Tandon had said sales of these products were up by 10-20 times before the virus outbreak. “Order volumes are still higher than before Covid-19. But going forward, we are looking at supply issues and manpower crunch to meet the rising demand,” said CEO of another e-pharma platform. Typically, consumers on average transact 1.5-2 times from these companies, while average ticket size of purchase is Rs 1,400-1,700.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-plans-to-buy-e-pharmacy-netmeds/articleshow/75564362.cms,2

India, which has imposed the world's biggest shutdown to battle the spread of the coronavirus, last month launched the Aarogya Setu (Health Bridge) app -- a Bluetooth and GPS-based application which alerts users who may have come in contact with people who later test positive for COVID-19. The app, which has been downloaded more than 83 million times so far, was initially available to India's roughly 500 million smartphone users on Google's Android and Apple devices, but not to around 400 million users of more basic feature phones. Within a week, a version of the app will be rolled out to more than 100 million users of the $9 JioPhone - a cheap, internet-enabled feature phone that runs on a mobile operating system named KaiOS, a senior government official told Reuters. Launched by Reliance Industries' telecoms unit in 2017, the phone gives users access to 4G mobile data and apps including Facebook Inc's popular WhatsApp messenger.  ""We are pushing it ... the testing is going on,"" said the official who declined to be identified as the plan is not public. India's technology ministry and Reliance Jio did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.  Contact tracing apps such as Aarogya Setu are being used in an attempt to speed up the process of identifying, testing and isolating people exposed to the virus before they spread it to others. While many countries around the world are using similar apps, some such as Australia and Colombia are turning to technology from Apple and Alphabet's Google amid citizens' privacy concerns and glitchy state-backed systems.

The sensex lost 886 points, or 2.8%, before closing at 31,123 points. Selling was led by foreign funds and across the broad, with Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, HDFC and Infosys accounting for most of the loss.The day’s fall more than wiped out the 637 points the sensex had gained on Wednesday on hopes of a stimulus package. Since the immediate spends of the fiscal stimulus package that was announced on Wednesday were relatively small, there were doubts if economic growth will revive soon. This was a concern for the market, HDFC Securities MD & CEO Dhiraj Relli said. 75749535On the other hand, in the US on Wednesday, its central bank’s chief Jerome Powell had said that the Covid-19 pandemic may leave a lasting impact on the global economy. This also spooked investors and US stocks closed lower, which in turn had an impact on Asian markets.As foreign funds led the selling, Thursday’s session here recorded a net outflow of Rs 2,153 crore, while domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 802 crore, according to BSE data. The day’s strong selling also left investors poorer by a little over Rs 2 lakh crore, with the BSE’s m-capitalisation now at Rs 122.6 lakh crore.According to Religare Broking VP (research) Ajit Mishra, the rise on Thursday in the number of Covid-19 infections in India and lack of clarity over the impact of the stimulus package weighed on sentiment. Going forward, “the focus would remain on the FM’s announcements over the next few days”, which will detail the probable beneficiaries of the stimulus package.“Markets will react to those announcements in the following sessions.” In addition, the guidelines for the next phase of lockdown will also be on the mind of market players, Mishra said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-dives-886-points-as-stimulus-disappoints/articleshow/75749538.cms,1

However, the Rs 4.9-lakh-crore equity valuation represents a 12.5% premium to Facebook’s investment in Jio. 75798901The money from General Atlantic will help reduce RIL’s debt, which stood at Rs 3.36 lakh crore as on March 31. “I have known General Atlantic for several decades and greatly admired it for its belief in India’s huge growth potential,” said RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani.The 1980-established General Atlantic, which manages assets worth $34 billion, has placed its bets on disruptive companies like Airbnb, Snapchat, Uber, Box, ByteDance. “General Atlantic has a long track record working alongside founders to scale disruptive businesses, as Jio is doing at the forefront of the digital revolution in India,” said the fund’s CEO Bill Ford.There are reports that Saudi Arabia’s $320-billion Public Investment Fund too may purchase a stake in Jio. While RIL has not commented on this, it had said earlier that it received strong interest from various investors to acquire a stake in Jio. The four foreign firms together own 14.8% of Jio with RIL holding the balance 85.2%.RIL launched Jio in 2016 by offering free voice calls and ultra cheap 4G data plans. Since then, it has transformed India’s telecom sector, emerging as the largest player with 388 million subscribers.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/general-atlantic-picks-1-3-in-jio-for-rs-6598-crore/articleshow/75796185.cms,0

Excluding reinvested earnings, inflows were 14% higher at just a shade under $50 billion, which is also an all-time high.

This means one can run any task — grocery delivery, medicine delivery, pickup-and-drop — by using the Dunzo tab inside the payments app.Dunzo, where Google is also an investor, is believed to be clocking over 1 lakh orders a day amid high demand for essential needs. For Dunzo, this would mean getting access to a large set of new users. For Google Pay, which is seeing higher usage in areas like utility payments but fewer payment volumes overall amid the lockdown, more consumers would frequent its app to use services like Dunzo and pay digitally. In 2019, Google Pay had announced it has 67 million monthly active users (MAU) in India. Last month, TOI reported, quoting SimilarWeb data, that it had 115 million MAU in March, growing by 45% from February. As the number of Covid-19 positive cases are still rising in India, more consumers are going for online delivery of essentials.Last week, Reliance Industries’ JioMart, which is running a pilot with Facebook-owned messaging application WhatsApp, announced that it has opened services in 200 cities. Other platforms like Swiggy, Zomato, Amazon India and Bigbasket are also scaling up their grocery play, with many of them offering deliveries in 2-4 hours from kirana stores. “Consumables (grocery and other essentials) is now 75% of the total volumes for Dunzo, which was around 45% when the first lockdown was imposed in March. Fundamentally, it (shopping) has become need-based and there is no impulse that you can create as there is enough demand already. What this also does is you don’t have to discount,” Dunzo co-founder and CEO Kabeer Biswas told TOI last week. Biswas added that this had led to customer acquisition costs coming down to zero for the Bengaluru-based startup. While Dunzo is trying to service higher volumes, it also took a decision of pausing deliveries in select geographies in the outskirts of cities to serve higher demand coming from within the city. This would be 5-6% of its total geographical reach. It is present in eight cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai.A Google Pay spokesperson confirmed the Dunzo storefront on its platform. “The launch of the Dunzo Spot and the addition of LPG service providers are all examples of how we’re solving this (customer and business needs),” it added. Google Pay recently expanded the footprint of the Nearby Stores Spot to 35 cities, where users can find if nearby stores, selling essentials, are open and make digital payments if the store offers delivery. Google Pay rival PhonePe also has a similar offering on its platform named Stores. A Dunzo spokesperson did not respond to TOI’s emailed query till the time of going to the press. Some other storefronts, or ‘Spots’, on Google Pay include MakeMyTrip and Urban Company (formerly UrbanClap).",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gpay-ties-up-with-dunzo-for-essentials/articleshow/76079163.cms,2

He said these figures provide confidence that the country is poised for a turnaround.Goyal said the contraction rate is coming down despite the fact that the country was under lockdown during large part of May.Further talking about June exports, he said the situation gets even more exciting as ""our export in the first week of June, is at par with what it was in June 1-7, 2019"".Exports during June 1-7 this year dipped by only about 0.76 per cent to $4.94 billion from $5.03 billion in the same period last year, the minister said.He added that some stress could be there on certain discretionary spending sectors, and segments like textiles may take a little longer to recover.""I hope that by the time we close March 2021, we would have recovered the lost ground of April and May. It will be a loss of close to USD 30 billion in two months....I have the confidence that our exporters and logistics companies together will make that happen,"" he said.Contracting for the second straight month, India's exports shrunk by a record 60.28 per cent in April to $10.36 billion, mainly on account of the coronavirus lockdown.Imports also plunged by 58.65 per cent to $17.12 billion in April, leaving a trade deficit of $6.76 billion as against $15.33 billion in April 2019.The webinar was organised by digital freight forwarding startup Freightwalla.Talking about migrant workers, Goyal said now the industry needs to take proper care of them when they return for work.""...you cannot leave them in the lurch, you cannot let them fend for themselves. I think there will be lot of good coming up out of this lockdown that we faced.

But in the halls of Reliance Industries Ltd, Manoj Modi has quietly become one of the most powerful forces behind the corporate empire of Asia’s richest man.Reserved and mostly invisible to the public, Modi is viewed by many insiders and others in India’s business world as the right hand of billionaire Mukesh Ambani. He played a key role during negotiations for a $5.7 billion deal with Facebook Inc in April, backing Ambani and his children as they hashed out an agreement with the social networking giant, people familiar with the matter said.As Ambani, 63, shifts his sprawling conglomerate’s focus from petrochemicals to internet technologies, Modi is seen as a particularly influential voice. Facebook’s investment in the group’s Jio Platforms was followed by similar deals from a slew of private-equity funds, injecting $13 billion into the business and placing it firmly on Silicon Valley’s radar.The sixty-something, diminutive Modi -- who isn’t related to India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- rarely gives interviews and there’s little in the public realm about his private life. Yet he illustrates how lesser known personalities in India with long-running ties to corporate dynasties can have an outsized impact.“It’s not a company that advertises its organizational structure but the industry knows that Ambani and Modi are a strongly-bonded team -- and together drive deal negotiation and relentless execution to the last level of detail,” said Vani Kola, managing director of venture capital firm, Kalaari Capital Partners, who persuaded Modi to make a rare public appearance at a conference last year, albeit by video.A Reliance spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comments from the company and Modi.Making moneyModi is a director at Reliance Retail Ltd and the group’s telecom carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. At Kola’s conference, he downplayed his skills. “I don’t really negotiate,” Modi said. “I don’t understand strategy,” he went on. “In fact, people internally know that I don’t even have a vision.” He described his role, saying, “I deal with our internal people, coaching them, mentoring them and guiding them on how something can be done.”But then came a hint of his thinking: “Our principle at Reliance is very simple: Unless everyone makes money while working with us, you cannot have a sustainable business.”In interviews, more than half-a-dozen executives in the technology industry, who have had dealings with Reliance, said Modi has a reputation for driving hard bargains. When dealing with startups, he often controls negotiations from behind the scenes by instructing executives how far to push, making an appearance nearing deal fruition, they said.While Reliance’s recent mega investments have drawn the spotlight, the conglomerate also began an acquisition spree to buy smaller firms some years ago to build expertise in newer technologies from artificial intelligence to blockchain. The idea is to create a digital business that wields power in everything from online retail to streamed entertainment and internet payments.Modi has a big say in every deal and often a meeting with him signals the final stamp of approval, four different startup founders said in interviews.“He derives his power in the organization not just because of his loyalty, but because of his very astute, smart and able negotiator skills for Reliance Industries,” GR Gopinath, founder of budget carrier Air Deccan, who had sold a stake in his cargo airline to Reliance in 2010. “Significantly, though without formal education from Ivy League universities, he has a very sharp mind and a rare insight and native genius to grasp modern technology in the Indian context.”Gopinath said Modi is “ruthlessly efficient” and manages to get the best possible deal for Reliance in mergers and acquisitions.Modi is one of the few who have been with the company since the 1980s when Ambani’s late father was building the oil-and-petrochemicals giant. A few years earlier, Manoj Harjivandas Modi and Ambani had studied at what was then called the University Department of Chemical Technology in Mumbai and become fast friends.That’s allowed Modi a chance to work with three generations of the Ambani dynasty: The late patriarch Dhirubhai, then Mukesh and his wife Nita, and now his children Isha and Akash, who are playing more prominent roles on deals like Facebook.Over the years Modi became known as the execution man, overseeing large projects. He broke new ground by managing Reliance’s retail reach to smaller cities and expanded it to India’s largest retailer. But it was with the pathbreaking telecom service that Ambani built up that Modi came into his own.Telecom talksHis negotiating skills were very visible when Reliance Jio raced to launch its wireless services in 2016 and built its fiber optic cable network.One of the people who participated in the negotiations described a scene where select vendors were summoned to the headquarters for talks. The bait dangled in front of each was the massive scale of the project. Unknown to vendors at that time, multiple Reliance teams negotiated simultaneously in separate rooms with Modi as the interface guiding executives, that person said.These days, after crushing its rivals, Jio is the largest telecom operator in India with nearly 400 million users. It’s also increasingly important to global businesses like Facebook and WhatsApp as it serves as an entryway into an exploding digital economy and an e-commerce ecosystem that includes payments, education and health care.“Their work in expanding access to affordable mobile broadband has been phenomenal,” Ajit Mohan, vice president and managing director in India for Facebook, said of Ambani’s company.Among the skills Modi has honed is working with senior executives at Reliance, like Anshuman Thakur, head of strategy at Reliance Jio Infocomm and a long time banker, who plays a key role on deals and regularly briefs the press.Consumer spendingDuring the negotiations for the Facebook deal, Ambani, his children Isha and Akash, and Modi were key right through the discussions, one of the people familiar with the transaction said. Once Ambani gave the go ahead, Thakur worked to structure the deal, one of the people said.In recent weeks, Jio’s investor list has included big private equity names like KKR & Co, Silver Lake Partners, Vista Equity Partners and General Atlantic. Still, the global coronavirus pandemic is poised to put India on track for a sharp economic contraction, which means Modi and Ambani will have their work cut out for them growing digital sales while consumer spending slows.Meanwhile, a crash in oil prices caused uncertainty in negotiations to sell an estimated $15 billion stake in Reliance Industries’ oil and chemicals division to Saudi Arabian Oil Co, or Aramco, as part of its bid to pay down its formidable debt pile, which stood at more than $20 billion as of March last year. Reliance recently said the Aramco talks are progressing.Very little is known about the actual plans of Jio Platforms as the digital business rolls into the next phase of its expansion.

The deal was to be concluded by March 2020 but has been delayed.""Reliance is working to complete the contours of a strategic partnership with Saudi Aramco,"" Ambani said in the firm's latest annual report without giving timelines.The partnership with Aramco would give Jamnagar refineries ""access to a wide portfolio of value-accretive crude grades and enhanced feedstock security for a higher oil-to-chemicals conversion,"" he said.Reliance executed on the next phase of its growth journey in 2019-20, forging transformative partnerships across businesses.""Reliance and Aramco share a common outlook and vision on the evolution of the business in the future with emphasis on higher oil-to-chemicals conversion,"" the firm said in the annual report.Also, the firm said it has formed a 51:49 joint venture with BP plc of the UK for automobile and aviation fuel business in India.With a stake, Aramco would not just have a stake in one of the world's best refineries and the largest integrated petrochemical complex but also access to one of the fastest-growing markets -- a ready-made market for 5 lakh barrels per day of its Arabian crude and offering a potentially bigger downstream role in future.Besides refineries and petrochemical plants, the O2C business also comprises 51 per cent stake in the fuel retailing business. It, however, does not include the upstream oil- and gas-producing assets such as the flagging KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal.RIL's refineries are one of the most complex in the world, allowing it to earn a significant premium to the benchmark Singapore gross refining margin. Its petrochemical complexes rank among the biggest in the world, whose dependency on outside raw materials is minimal. RIL has leadership positions both in the domestic polymer and polyester markets.

After sharp losses in the first two months on market rout, the next two months saw a $18 billion surge in his fortune on the back of over Rs 1.69 lakh crore worth of deals struck by Reliance Industries in selling stakes in its telecom arm, it said.However, despite the late surge, his wealth was down 1 per cent as compared to the pre-COVID levels, it said.Ambani saw a ""V-shaped recovery"" in his wealth, wherein the networth plummeted during the first two months and made up nearly all the losses in the next two months, it said.Despite the networth being marginally lower, Ambani climbed up one place to be the eighth richest person in the world as of May 2020, it said.Jeff Bezos continues to be at the top of the list of the world's richest individuals with a 14 per cent gain in his fortune to $160 billion in four months to May, and is followed by Bill Gates at $100 billion (down 6 per cent), Bernard Arnault at $89 billion (down 17 per cent), Warren Buffet at $84 billion (down 18 per cent), Mark Zuckerberg at $84 billion (unchanged), Steve Ballmer at $67 billion (up 1 per cent) and Amancio Ortega at $67 billion (down 17 per cent), it said.Ambani's wealth erosion is the smallest as compared to other Indian billionaires in the top-100 list, like HCL's Shiv Nadar (16 per cent decline to $16 billion) and Gautam Adani and family (18 per cent decline to $14 billion), it said.Apart from Ambani, Poonawalla, Adani and Nadar, there are no Indians in the top-100 list.From a sectoral perspective, the biggest winners from the coronavirus pandemic seem to be online retailers, pharma, home improvement retailers, and also chocolate, soya sauce and pork producers, it said.Both the US and China have gained marginally when one looks at the top-100 wealth owners, though the Asian country's growth has been a bit stronger between the two, the statement said.The Indian stock market dropped 20 per cent during the pandemic and has made some gains lately, while the rupee has depreciated 5.6 per cent, it said.

We expect a break-up of the company in the next three-four years through the IPO of Jio and retail business segment which should further unlock shareholder value,"" the analyst said.Looking at the balance sheet, Reliance has significantly improved its financial position following the transactions, it said, adding that the net debt to equity will fall significantly from 0.51x in FY20 to 0.06x in FY21 which is the lowest in almost a decade.Given the $15 billion Aramco deal and free cash flow outlook in the next several years, net debt to equity could continue to fall beyond FY21, it said.Reliance is in talks with Aramco to sell a fifth of its $75 billion oil-to-chemical business.""The key question is what will Reliance do with the significant cash position? We think the priority for now is to reduce other liabilities on the balance sheet such as deferred payments and provisions which total in excess of Rs 50,000 crore,"" it said.Given the company's expansion into internet and retail, more investments including mergers and acquisitions seem highly likely, the brokerage said adding that refining and petchem could also see expansion with the Aramco partnership.""Overall, we expect RIL will continue to invest in growth over returning cash to shareholders,"" it said.While earnings will soften in FY21 due to COVID-19, the brokerage believed that RIL is at the start of a secular growth period driven by telecom, retail and new economy related business.""We estimate EBITDA for FY21 of Rs 86,000 crore, which is almost double what it was a few years ago,"" it said.

The move will further cement RIL’s position as the top brick-and-mortar player across categories like groceries, fashion and general merchandise, said two people briefed on the matter.The deal will involve at least three companies promoted by Biyani—Future Retail, Future Lifestyle Fashions and Future Supply Chain Solutions —going for a merger. The combined business will then be acquired by the Mukesh Ambani-controlled petrochemicals-to-telecom conglomerate.76702335The discussions are now at an advanced stage, and RIL is keen on closing it before the upcoming AGM on July 15. But details are still being ironed out on both sides, and a final deal is still to be signed, the sources said. Discussions for the deal started earlier this year as one of Biyani’s holding units defaulted on a loan repayment.Known as the retail king, Biyani has since then been looking at options, including stake sales in retail units and also putting up for sale the insurance joint venture Future Generali.Several other players like US-based retail giant Amazon had evinced interest in Future Group. But a deal with Reliance offers a much comprehensive solution to Biyani’s debt problems, said a source. “It is likely to be a complex transaction as, first, Future Group will announce a scheme of arrangement to merge into one company. RIL is most likely to completely buy out this combined entity in exchange for its shares,” said one of the sources. Existing investors in various Future Group businesses—Amazon, Blackstone and PremjiInvest—may get shares in RIL. The deal with Reliance is interesting as Jeff Bezos-owned Amazon has had a business partnership with Future Group since 2014. Last year, Amazon also acquired an indirect stake in Future Retail by investing in one of the promoter entities of Biyani.“It’s fair to assume it’s going in Reliance’s direction now. Even though others are still in talks with Future, the strategic direction is clear now, compared to last week when it could have gone either way,” a person aware of the matter said. He added that while Reliance will take over all of the retail businesses, some brands and manufacturing businesses under companies like Future Consumer and Future Market Networks might remain with Biyani. These details are yet to be finalised as talks were under way on Monday.An email sent to Future Group and RIL spokespersons did not elicit any response till the time of going to the press. Two separate sources said Amazon’s rights, when it struck a deal with Future Coupons giving it an almost 4% stake indirectly in Future Retail last year, is “subjective to conditions” and might not be a big hurdle for the deal.“Reliance would have certainly looked at it before proceeding on the deal,” one of the people mentioned earlier said.These people said the implication of this deal with Reliance would have a “significant impact” on the retail sector — both online and offline. Future Retail has over 1,500 retail stores in various formats through brands like Big Bazaar, Nilgiris and Easyday, while Future Lifestyle has 300 stores through brands life Central and Brand Factory.“This would add a new dimension to the much-touted Ambani-Bezos (Amazon CEO) battle,” this person said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-nears-deal-to-acquire-retail-biz-of-future-group/articleshow/76701507.cms,2

The,"BENGALURU: Top Silicon Valley investor Sequoia has raised $1.35 billion for its new fund focused on investing in startups in India along with Southeast Asia. The move comes as the Covid-19 pandemic speeds up the adoption of digital services across sectors like education, payments and software. The fund raised under Sequoia Capital India will be a record corpus for the region, and takes the firm’s assets under management to over $5.7 billion.The VC firm, which has been an early backer of 11 unicorns — including India’s most valued startups like ed-tech decacorn Byju’s and hospitality player Oyo — has approved over half a dozen deals during the June quarter. It has already started seeing businesses in SaaS (software-as-a-service), education, gaming, digital content and payments beat their projections for the quarter even as those in areas like travel, transportation and retail have been hit.Sequoia Capital India MD Shailendra Singh feels that the pandemic offers startups a time to prioritise on building more profitable businesses than just grab market share. “We want to encourage founders to go for more sustainable growth against this idea to raise and burn capital. We worry that Nasdaq is at an all-time high and technology stocks in the US markets are trading at very high valuations. So will that spill over to private markets and will we see another bull cycle and everyone goes back to burning money?” he told TOI in an exclusive interview.Sequoia has split the corpus into two vehicles — $525 million for early stage, and $825 million for growth stage. The firm had raised a separate $195-million fund last year for seed deals, including its accelerator programme Surge. Up to 20-30% of the funds will be invested in Southeast Asia, where Sequoia has backed the region’s most valued internet companies like ride-hailing and delivery player Gojek and e-commerce platform Tokopedia.The split in the fund comes as the ecosystem has now matured, with more startups reaching valuations of over $5-10 billion. More than 20 portfolio companies of Sequoia have crossed revenues of $100 million, with many reaching that milestone faster than the previous batch of companies. But according to Singh, more measures can be taken to unlock value of Indian startups and investors more exit options.“We are really strongly requesting the government to create the enabling resolution for Indian companies to list on Nasdaq (and other global exchanges), which will be a game changer for the ecosystem. US markets value tech companies differently than Indian markets. It will also create a wave of further FDI into India because investors across the world can invest in the best of the Indian companies and will get to taste success,” he said.Sequoia’s mega fund also comes at a time when the Indian government has put restrictions on investments from China, which has left founders who depended on players like Tencent and Alibaba for money worried. But given the “trillions of dollars with no opportunity cost of capital available in the world” looking for next growth markets, founders building a sustainable business should not be worried, according to Singh, who is also a part of the Forbes Midas Touch list of top global venture investors.“Short term there might be some pain, but long term there is enough capital available — whether it is South Korea, Japan, the US, Europe or sovereign funds from Singapore or the Middle East...Tech is going to generate significantly large companies over the next decade,” he said. He added that India and Southeast Asia should also mirror the US in the long run where Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are the most valued companies.One of the companies looking to become a part of that club is Jio Platforms, the telecom services provider owned by Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries. Over the last few months, Jio has raised $15.5 billion at a valuation of over $65 billion from backers, including US social media giant Facebook, as it looks at a broader digital services play. This would mean it will compete with startups across e-commerce and education-technology.“What Jio has done by bringing low-cost, high-speed internet across the country has helped the whole startup ecosystem. Now their ambitions are becoming more mainstream and conflicting with some of the important startups. In execution-oriented industries, like areas that require big infrastructure build-out, they will be a strong competitor. What we have to see is how well they do in areas where building software and having world-class engineers is the moat,” said Singh.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sequoia-raises-record-1-3-billion-to-back-startups-in-india-southeast-asia/articleshow/76819167.cms,2

The 2019 AGM highlight was the end of the telecom investment cycle, de-leveraging in 18 months and telecom and retail listing in 5 years.Proceeds from the stake sales in Jio Platforms along with the Rs 53,124 crore raised in a rights issue in June and from the sale of a 49 per cent stake in its fuel retail network to BP last summer for Rs 7,000 crore, will help the company become net debt-free, Reliance announced last month, once the promised funds come in (75 per cent of the funds from the rights issue will come in next year).Goldman Sachs said the focus of the AGM is expected to be largely on product launches around RIL's partnership with Facebook potentially ranging from integration of JioMart with WhatsApp, additional colour on payments business and launch of a large product ecosystem (Super App) where Jio could integrate its services with WhatsApp.""We also expect additional colour on their vision to maximise oil to chemical conversion (to over 70 per cent) to create an annuity-like cash flow, potentially leveraging its proprietary Multi-zone Catalytic Cracking process and through a potential strategic partnership with Saudi Aramco,"" it said.In the past, RIL has talked about 500 million customers being within its reach. Jio currently has a base of around 388 million subscribers. ""We will look for any further colour on Jio's strategy to bring the next 100 million into the fold,"" it said.Last year, RIL announced plans to reach 20 million homes and 15 million businesses for its Jio?ber product (timeline were unspeci?ed). As per TRAI data, Jio had less than a million subscribers for this product as of February 2020.RIL at the last AGM stated that Jio is already a software company, and had invested in 14 startups until then. ""We will look for potential colour on the monetisation of its existing internet platforms (music, video, and news apps), and potential foray into any newer verticals,"" it said.In the 2019 AGM, RIL had outlined its ambition to be in the top 20 global retailers in the next five years. Following the recent launch of JioMart, the management is expected to provide more colour on the path to achieve this ambition.Goldman Sachs said it expects management to provide greater insights into the strategic partnership with Saudi Aramco and how that could into their ambition of an industry-leading oil to the chemical platform with over 70 per cent conversion of oil into petrochemicals.BofA Securities said of the five key initiatives announced in last AGM, RIL completed the strategic stake sale of Jio, petro-retail, and moved to zero net debt.

But when Ambani faces shareholders at Relianc","NEW DELHI: For decades, Mukesh Ambani’s empire has been supported by the energy flank he inherited from his father.But when Ambani faces shareholders at Reliance Industries Ltd’s annual meeting on Wednesday, he’ll be speaking on behalf of an empire that is increasingly breaking free from oil-price fortunes. The billionaire’s string of deals with Facebook Inc and other Silicon Valley players this year have propelled Reliance into the e-commerce and technology space like never before.The stock has more than doubled since a low in March to a record as Jio Platforms Ltd, Reliance’s digital services business unit, netted almost $16 billion in a fundraising blitz. All this at a time when sentiment in the oil market remains fragile even after prices have recovered from a two-decade low.The flurry of deals for Jio have backed Ambani’s ambition to morph Reliance from an energy company to an e-commerce giant. They’ve also reduced oil’s influence on the company’s stock price. The company’s shares have a beta of 0.14 with Brent crude now, meaning a 1% weekly drop in oil causes no more than 0.14% fall in Reliance. This factor was as high as 0.7 during the 2008 meltdown, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Jio is at the center of Ambani’s drive to create a homegrown version of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The tie-up with Facebook has given the venture a Silicon Valley stamp of approval and has lured a dozen investors, enthused by the unit’s potential to shake up online retail, content streaming, digital payments, education and health care in a market of 1.3 billion people.“Business-to-consumer sectors like retail and digital are more resilient to economic shocks,” said Harsh Dole, an analyst at India Infoline Finance Ltd. “These sectors fetch a premium return for valuation. The stock has been a beneficiary of that, no doubt.”Facebook, which paid $5.7 billion for about 10% of Jio Platforms, has said it expects the tie up will make WhatsApp the primary way millions of India’s small businesses connect with customers. The messaging app has roughly 400 million users in the country, about the same as Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s subscriber base for wireless services.Rising share 76954952All told, the sale of 25.2% stake in Jio along with the $7 billion rights offering to Reliance shareholders allowed Ambani to declare his flagship free of net debt earlier than the March 2021 target. Last week, BP Plc paid $1 billion for a 49% stake in the company’s fuel-retail business, completing a deal announced in 2019. Reliance said it had net debt of 1.6 trillion rupees as of March.The diversification has begun to trim the company’s dependence on the cyclical energy-related businesses. Petrochemicals and refining, which made up almost all of Reliance’s earnings in 2017, has since shrunk to 65%. The contribution from digital and retail businesses has increased threefold during the period. 76954960On paper, Reliance is ‘net debt zero’ ahead of schedule.

The investment — which will be done in two tranches this financial year — values the company at $24.9 billion, an over 13% premium from the $22 billion at the time of the acquisition in 2018. Walmart’s shareholding will go up to a “little over 80%” with this round of infusion.The companies said in a statement that a “group of existing shareholders” also participated in the round, though it did not specify names. The remaining major shareholders include China’s Tencent and New York-based Tiger Global, both of which own 5%, besides Microsoft and co-founder Binny Bansal. The capital will be used for the online retail business of the Singapore-registered Flipkart — which also includes fashion portal Myntra — where the company has been locked in a market share battle with US-based Amazon. 76967651The group’s payments unit PhonePe has been looking to raise capital separately and spin off its business to unlock further value.

But the company also faced setbacks due to changes in FDI norms for e-commerce in early 2019, which led to it restructuring operations. It has also seen the exit of group CEO Binny Bansal after allegations of improper conduct, while Kalyan Krishnamurthy runs the e-commerce business and Sameer Nigam runs PhonePe, reporting directly to the Flipkart board.Satish Meena, senior forecast analyst at market research firm Forrester, said the competition among Walmart, Amazon India and Reliance’s Jio Mart will get more aggressive and play out in the next 12-18 months as the pandemic pushes e-commerce growth. In terms of areas where Walmart’s new capital will be allocated, Meena said there are three primary segments — grocery & food retail, digitising small sellers & businesses, and experiments around video & social-commerce.“They are looking at aggressive expansion in grocery, which wasn’t in focus earlier. But that has changed after Covid-19. Their food retail licence was not approved, but they are rectifying it and you can expect significant investment to go there,” he added.Flipkart said that it has surpassed 1.5 billion visits per month and reported 45% growth in monthly active customers and 30% growth in transactions per customer for FY20. It has 150 million products across more than 80 categories.

The move is part of its plan to join rival Facebook in upping its play in one of the world’s biggest internet services markets.Google, according to Bloomberg, is in talks to acquire a $4-billion (Rs 30,000-crore) stake in Jio, the digital technology arm of billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s sprawling conglomerate Reliance Industries (RIL). If the talks convert into a transaction, then Google will be the second strategic investor in Jio after Facebook, with a seat on the board of the Indian company. Facebook has spent $5.7 billion (Rs 43,574 crore) for a 9.9% stake in Jio. RIL didn’t respond to the query based on the Bloomberg report, while Google couldn’t be contacted for immediate comments. 76973728While announcing its $10-billion commitment to India, Google CEO Sundar Pichai had said that the company will route the investment through equity deals, partnerships and other structures. The US tech major already has investments in Indian companies such as local delivery app Dunzo. Google, whose Android mobile operating system powers a bulk of India’s 500 million smartphones, is looking at various opportunities to ramp up its play here. And Jio, which counts 400 million subscribers on its wireless network, offers the largest base of customers. So far, RIL has sold a quarter of Jio to 12 foreign investors, raising Rs 1.18 lakh crore (nearly $16 billion) in total. Aside from Facebook, the rest 11 shareholders in Jio are investment funds. Jio, worth Rs 5.16 lakh crore, is at the core of Ambani’s plan to transform RIL from a refining-to-exploration company to a tech major. All the deals in Jio are a precursor to Ambani’s main plan of taking the digital company public in the future. Ambani may explore an overseas listing for Jio, possibly Nasdaq, after India proposed direct listing of companies in certain foreign jurisdictions.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/google-eyes-4bn-jio-stake-to-expand-indian-tech-play/articleshow/76967759.cms,2

Talking about the Reliance Foundation, she said that in the last 10 years, the foundation has changed the lives of 30 million people in the country.""At the time of the coronavirus outbreak, we set up India's first 100-bed special Covid-19 hospital in Mumbai in just two weeks,"" she said.""Our doctors and nurses are selfless and tireless, trying to serve fellow Indians.

The word startup was mentioned 39 times in his speech during the AGM address, where he also called Jio a startup.“We have a very special place in our heart for startups… whom we consider our brothers-in-arms. I believe that there is no better partner for Indian startups than Jio,” said Ambani. “We are ready to integrate them into our road map and to help them reach their full potential.”He added that the oil-to-telecom conglomerate has already partnered with 20 startups, and wants to with them to “promote ‘Made-in-India’, ‘Made-for-India’ and ‘Made-for-the-World’ products.” RIL has spent $3 billion on acquisitions, primarily for Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail since 2017, according to a Morgan Stanley note in December.RIL may provide an opportunity to small- and mid-sized startups. But it is now a competitor to some of the most valued Indian startups like mobile payments major Paytm, education technology decacorn Byju’s and business-to-business commerce major Udaan, according to experts tracking the space.Reliance Jio’s fund-raise of $20 billion in the last few months is more than the $14.5 billion mobilised by the entire startup ecosystem in 2019, which was a record year. With restrictions on Chinese investments and Jio already cornering capital from Facebook and Google, two US tech giants who may have provided an alternative, some high-valued companies can find the going tough.“There are clearly some businesses that are winner-takes-all, where the top player takes most of the customer mind and market share. For those businesses to compete with Jio and its partners on money will be fairly tough,” said K Ganesh, serial entrepreneur and investor who has backed startups like Bigbasket and Portea.By reaching out to startups, Ambani is also taking a leaf out of the books of other large tech platforms as it looks to provide more services to its 388 million subscribers. Chinese conglomerate Tencent, which owns the ubiquitous messaging platform WeChat, has invested in over 800 startups, mostly in its home market. Some of these companies, like food delivery platform Meituan Dianping and social commerce platform Pinduoduo have leveraged WeChat to now become China’s most valued companies.RIL’s move could potentially help M&A activity among startups, especially deals of $100-200 million, take off further. “One of the biggest issues for startups in India is that local corporates historically haven’t acquired local companies, but the size and scale of RIL’s ambition can change the mentality and start the flywheel of M&As,” added Ganesh.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-best-partner-for-indian-startups-mukesh-ambani/articleshow/76984877.cms,0

The deal was to be concluded by March 2020 but was delayed.""Reliance is working to complete the contours of a strategic partnership with Saudi Aramco,"" Ambani had said in the firm's latest annual report without giving timelines.The partnership with Aramco would give Jamnagar refineries ""access to a wide portfolio of value-accretive crude grades and enhanced feedstock security for higher oil-to-chemicals conversion,"" he had said in the annual report.With a stake, Aramco would not just have a share in one of the world's best refineries and the largest integrated petrochemical complex but also access to one of the fastest-growing markets -- a ready-made market for 5 lakh barrels per day of its Arabian crude and offering a potentially bigger downstream role in future.Besides refineries and petrochemical plants, the O2C business also comprises a 51 per cent stake in the fuel retailing business. It, however, does not include the upstream oil- and gas-producing assets such as the flagging KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal.Ambani said Reliance has concluded the sale of a 49 per cent stake in its fuel retailing venture to BP for Rs 7,629 crore.RIL's refineries are one of the most complex in the world, allowing it to earn a significant premium to the benchmark Singapore gross refining margin. Its petrochemical complexes rank among the biggest in the world, whose dependency on outside raw materials is minimal. RIL has leadership positions both in the domestic polymer and polyester markets.The O2C business will be carved out into a division where Aramco will have an economic interest. It will have its own management and accounts just like the conglomerate's digital arm, Jio Platforms.RIL had organised all its digital businesses including Reliance Jio that has 388 million telecom subscribers, into Jio Platforms. It has sold 32.84 per cent stake in Jio Platforms Ltd - the unit that houses India's youngest but largest telecom firm Jio Infocomm and apps. In total, Jio has raised Rs 1,52,055.45 crore.RIL was to receive the proceeds from the Aramco stake sale in three stages - 50 per cent on closing, another 25 per cent after one year of closing and the balance 25 per cent in the following year.

After providing affordable 4G handsets in the form of the JioPhone powered by KaiOS, Jio is now looking forward to introducing affordable 5G phones as well. Jio Platforms and Google have also entered into a commercial agreement to jointly develop an entry level affordable smartphone with optimizations to the Android operating system and the Play Store. “JioPhone continues to be the world’s most affordable 4G phone...we have sold 100 million JioPhone handsets till date, there are many feature phone users who are waiting to upgrade to a conventional smartphone, if only it was somehow more affordable,” said Ambani. The company claims that there are 350 million feature phone users still in India. “We believe we can design an entry level 4G or even a 5G smartphone for a fraction of its current cost. But to power such a value engineered smartphone we also need an equally value engineered smartphone operating system. Google and Jio are partnering to build an Android-based smartphone operating system,” he said. “As India is standing at the doorstep of the 5G era, we should accelerate the migration of current 2G feature phone users to an affordable smartphone...Jio is determined to make India 2G-mukht,” it added. Meanwhile, Google has announced that it is investing Rs 33,737 crore in Jio Platforms. This investment by Google values Jio Platforms at an equity value of ₹ 4.36 lakh crore. Google’s investment will translate into a 7.73% equity stake in Jio Platforms on a fully diluted basis.

In addition to grocery, Ambani said, the company will expand JioMart to cover electronics, fashion, pharmaceutical and healthcare. The omni-channel venture, that was rolled out during the lockdown in May to sell essential items such as food and grocery, will focus on connecting farmers and delivering their fresh produce directly to homes. Reliance Retail currently sources over 80% of its fresh fruits and vegetables directly from farmers, according to the company. “We are accelerating the rollout of JioMart,” he said. JioMart, in addition to its partnership with Facebook-owned WhatsApp, is working on a hybrid model — a mix of hyperlocal and inventory-led design — that will, for instance, allow consumers to shop from their neighbourhood stores and will also have support from Reliance Retail outlets in the back-end to fulfil orders from consumers and replenish stocks of store owners on its platform when necessary. 76988400“Within a few weeks of launch, we have reached over 2.5 lakh orders a day and the numbers continue to grow each day,” said Ambani. “JioMart is now focused on scaling its geographical reach and delivery capabilities. In the coming years, we will cover many more cities, serve many more customers across India, and expand in many more categories.”Reliance Retail, which has more than two-thirds of its nearly 12,000 stores operating in tier-2, -3 and -4 towns, is India’s largest retail business in terms of revenue. Last year, Reliance Retail’s revenues were Rs 1,62,936 crore and ebitda was Rs 9,654 crore. “In the last five years, our revenues in the retail business have grown eight times and our profits 11 times,” said Ambani.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-retail-to-rope-in-global-partners-in-next-few-qtrs/articleshow/76988401.cms,0

The urgency to conclude the transaction with Saudi Aramco has eased as RIL’s “equity requirements have already been met”. While Ambani didn’t give any new timeline for the completion of the deal with Saudi Aramco, the chairman said RIL has been “approached by global companies for strategic partnerships in the petrochemical business”. He, however, didn’t name any company. Last year, Ambani had announced that Saudi Aramco would acquire a 20% stake in the oil-to-chemicals business, valued at $75 billion including debt, with the deal to be closed by March 2020. “Due to unforeseen circumstances in the energy market and the Covid-19 situation, the deal has not progressed as per the original timeline,” Ambani told shareholders. “Nevertheless, we at Reliance value our over two-decade-long relationship with Saudi Aramco and are committed to a long-term partnership.” 76988375RIL has been sourcing crude oil from Saudi Aramco for many years and it recently sold a 2.32% stake in Jio to the Kingdom-managed Public Investment Fund (PIF) for Rs 11,367 crore ($1.5 billion). PIF is managed by Yasir al-Rumayyan, who is also the chairman of Saudi Aramco. RIL will approach the National Company Law Tribunal to spin off the oil-to-chemicals business into a separate subsidiary. The process, expected to be completed by early 2021, is to “facilitate multiple partnership opportunities” in the business.“The strategic partnerships will help us build competitive manufacturing capacity at our existing sites,” said Ambani, adding that this will help RIL “serve the deficit Indian market that still depends on large-scale imports of chemicals”. RIL is not in a hurry to conclude the deal with Saudi Aramco in the petrochemicals business as it has raised more than Rs 2 lakh crore through other routes to pare debt. It has sold shares in its telecom and retail fuel units as well as sold its shares to existing shareholders, raising enough capital to eliminate its net debt. RIL’s deal with Saudi Aramco has slowed due to differences over structure and other issues. The company will, however, continue to pursue a partnership with Saudi Aramco, said Ambani.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/aramco-deal-has-not-progressed-as-planned/articleshow/76988376.cms,1

The word startup was mentioned 39 times in his speech during the AGM address, where he also called Jio a startup.“We have a very special place in our heart for startups… whom we consider our brothers-in-arms. I believe that there is no better partner for Indian startups than Jio,” said Ambani. “We are ready to integrate them into our road map and to help them reach their full potential.”He added that the oil-to-telecom conglomerate has already partnered with 20 startups, and wants to with them to “promote ‘Made-in-India’, ‘Made-for-India’ and ‘Made-for-the-World’ products.” RIL has spent $3 billion on acquisitions, primarily for Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail since 2017, according to a Morgan Stanley note in December.RIL may provide an opportunity to small- and mid-sized startups. But it is now a competitor to some of the most valued Indian startups like mobile payments major Paytm, education technology decacorn Byju’s and business-to-business commerce major Udaan, according to experts tracking the space.Reliance Jio’s fund-raise of $20 billion in the last few months is more than the $14.5 billion mobilised by the entire startup ecosystem in 2019, which was a record year. With restrictions on Chinese investments and Jio already cornering capital from Facebook and Google, two US tech giants who may have provided an alternative, some high-valued companies can find the going tough.“There are clearly some businesses that are winner-takes-all, where the top player takes most of the customer mind and market share. For those businesses to compete with Jio and its partners on money will be fairly tough,” said K Ganesh, serial entrepreneur and investor who has backed startups like Bigbasket and Portea.By reaching out to startups, Ambani is also taking a leaf out of the books of other large tech platforms as it looks to provide more services to its 388 million subscribers. Chinese conglomerate Tencent, which owns the ubiquitous messaging platform WeChat, has invested in over 800 startups, mostly in its home market. Some of these companies, like food delivery platform Meituan Dianping and social commerce platform Pinduoduo have leveraged WeChat to now become China’s most valued companies.RIL’s move could potentially help M&A activity among startups, especially deals of $100-200 million, take off further. “One of the biggest issues for startups in India is that local corporates historically haven’t acquired local companies, but the size and scale of RIL’s ambition can change the mentality and start the flywheel of M&As,” added Ganesh.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ambani-ril-best-partner-for-indian-startups/articleshow/76988420.cms,0

Through Jio, the group will not just offer telecom services and equipment but also handsets for which it intends to use Google’s Android platform.At Reliance Industries Ltd’s 43rd AGM, the Senior Ambani — who addressed shareholders through a video link from his residence Antilia — also said that his group’s aggressive fund-raising would continue as after the series of deals in telecom and digital through Jio Platforms, he would look at roping in international investors in Reliance Retail, which is taking on the e-tail giants such as Amazon and Walmart-led Flipkart through JioMart platform, which is now being offered in beta version but will soon be launched nationally.76999832“In last year’s AGM speech, I had shared my goals of growing our businesses through partnerships and achieving a net debt free balance sheet. I am happy to report that we have fulfilled this promise well ahead of the timelines that we had set ourselves,” he said, while announcing the investments by Google which also saw the Alphabet’s global CEO (and India-born) Sundar Pichai speak about the partnership as he joined in digitally.Google’s is the 13th investor to bet big on Jio Platforms in the past 12 weeks. The investment will give Google a 7.7% stake in Jio (Facebook has 9.9%) and will occupy a seat on its board alongside Facebook. 76999856His focus, however, remains on the new-age digital businesses as he called Jio as a “hyper-growth engine” for the company, which will see the maximum action in terms of expansion and new offerings. “The Digital Revolution marks the greatest disruptive transformation in the history of mankind… India must lead this change,” as he spoke about new platforms such as Jio Meet (which has 5 million downloads and taken on the likes of Zoom, Cisco Webex and Microsoft Meet), Jio Glass mixed-reality gear, and Jio TV Plus content aggregator (brings OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon and TV channels and apps to its set-top box users).He said that over the next three years, the company is eyeing to deploy over a billion smart sensors; while connecting with more than 50 million homes and business establishments.On 5G, where the government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have also emphasised on indigenous solutions (especially in the wake of troubles with China and Huawei), Ambani said that Jio has designed and developed a complete solution from scratch. “This will enable us to launch a world-class 5G service in India… using 100% home grown technologies and solutions.”Interestingly, Google’s investment pegged Jio’s equity value at Rs 4.36 lakh crore — lower to the equity valuation assigned by Facebook to the Indian company. Facebook had bought a 9.9% stake at a valuation of Rs 4.62 lakh crore. The investment in Jio by Google and Facebook is a rare case of two ‘FANG’ — Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google — companies investing in the same unit.Google investment comes as part of its $10 billion (Rs 75,000 crore) India-focused digitisation fund. “Through the partnership with Jio we see the chance to have an even greater impact than either company could have alone,” said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai in a video message.

The week ended July 10, saw forex reserves rise by $3.1 billion to a record $516 billion.According to bankers, the reserves are moving up on account of the continued dollar purchases by the Reserve of India (RBI). Last month the country’s reserves hit the half a trillion mark for the first time to $501billion. In little over a month, the RBI has added another $15 billion.In addition to the forex inflows due to Reliance Industries fundraising, dollar supplies have also been boosted by a trade surplus in June – the first in 18 years.“This (trade surplus) could be reflective of weak domestic demand, relative to global demand; the weakness in imports was spread across investment and consumption goods. India is likely to post a strong current account surplus in 1Q (FY21), which along with strong FDI inflows and stabilization in FII outflows, has helped the RBI shore up record FX reserves,” said Pranjul Bhandari, an economist at HSBC in a note.Forex reserves comprise of foreign currency assets, gold and drawing rights with multilateral institutions. In the week ended June 10, the reserves were up due to a $2.3 increase in foreign currency assets. Also, the increase in the value of gold pushed up gold reserves in dollar terms by $712 million to $34.72 billion.

JioPhone now has more 100 million users, many of whom are internet first-timers.""They (the Chinese players) are likely to cut their price to compete and their margins could shrink,"" said A Gururaj, the former India head of contract manufacturers Wistron and Flextronics. ""I see the Google-Jio phone as a big hit.""Reliance's ambition to hand a smartphone to every Indian could also win subscribers from telecoms rivals Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, who still have hundreds of millions of users with old-style feature phones on basic 2G networks.Realme declined to comment. Reliance, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo did not respond to requests for comment.Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Content is kingThe alliance will see Google invest $4.5 billion in Reliance's digital unit, which houses telecoms and fibre businesses as well as music and movie apps.Jio Platforms has also since April won the backing of global financial and tech investors including Intel and Qualcomm, which could bolster its smartphone ambitions.While Reliance has given no details on the specifications or price of the new smartphone, the timing of its launch, or who might build it, the Jio network's 387 million subscribers and the Google brand name will give it a big leg up.The Reliance-Google phone would likely be optimised for the Jio network and offer users improved performance, said Arvind Vohra, a tech consultant and the former India head of China's Gionee.Just as important are the possibilities for bundling Jio's massive video and music libraries with the phone.

RIL's e-commerce venture, JioMart plans to use Facebook's WhatsApp to connect local grocery stores with customers.Goldman Sachs said Bigbasket and Grofers accounted for more than 80 per cent of the market in 2019 in online grocery.Online grocery has been growing at over 50 per cent year-on-year for the last couple of years, but with the outbreak of COVID-19 resulting in shift to online, and the recent entry of RIL, the growth will accelerate to 81 per cent CAGR during 2019-24, it said.""We believe RIL's partnership with Facebook could result in the company becoming a market leader in the online grocery space, with more than 50 per cent share by 2024,"" it said. ""Having said that, we do see grocery as a large category for two or more players to co-exist over time.""Growth in India's e-commerce, the brokerage said, is likely to come from better penetration into categories such as grocery/FMCG, improving payment ecosystem and ease of shopping through WhatsApp etc.""We expect non-grocery e-commerce penetration to see a sharp increase of 500 basis points over the next two years to reach 16.1 per cent by 2021,"" Goldman Sachs said adding the last 500 basis points of the increase took four years.While online penetration in categories such as consumer electronics is fairly high at about 40 per cent as of 2019, there exists significant growth in categories like apparel, appliances, health and personal care, where online penetration in India remains materially lower when compared with peers such as China.""As far as incremental growth in e-commerce is concerned, we expect grocery to be the biggest driver with 40 per cent contribution to incremental e-commerce GMV (gross merchandise volume) between 2019 and 2024,"" it said.Grocery in India is a $380 billion category as of 2019, making up for 60 per cent of the total retail market.""However, online penetration currently stands at less than 0.5 per cent (absolute size $2 billion), one of the least among categories,"" it said projecting the online grocery market in India to grow 20x over the next 5 years, to reach $29 billion in value (5.1 per cent penetration) by 2024.It saw a higher acceptance of online purchases among Indian consumers, especially since COVID-19, as one of the key drivers.Other drivers include RIL's foray into the space leveraging its large offline distribution capabilities and ability to order groceries through WhatsApp - a platform with more than 400 million users in India.""Overall, we forecast online grocery orders to grow from 300,000 per day in 2019, to more than 5 million per day by 2024,"" it said.Goldman Sachs said the coronavirus pandemic has driven an acceleration in the adoption of countless technologies and consumer behaviours, chief among them being e-commerce.""What started at first with panic buying, hoarding and nest feathering out of necessity has turned into an array of adaptations that have driven e-commerce penetration from 16 per cent of retail spending in the US in 1Q19 to over 40 per cent in May driven by year- over-year growth of nearly 70 per cent,"" it said.Globally, e-commerce would grow 24 per cent, it added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/e-commerce-to-grow-27-reliance-to-capture-half-of-online-grocery-sales-goldman/articleshow/77088640.cms,0

The two have ironed out their differences over certain terms and conditions and a deal will be announced soon, said people familiar with the negotiations. Future’s interests are spread across various entities, including six listed companies. RIL will acquire the retail, supply-chain and related businesses of Future, which will mark the end of founder Kishore Biyani’s play in India’s modern retail, an industry he pioneered. A point under discussion has been Biyani’s role after the deal. One of the people quoted earlier pointed out that companies in which RIL acquires a minority stake, the founder-promoters continue to manage the show, with the energy-to-telecom enterprise occupying board seats, and not otherwise. A second person said that the deal has taken time due to disagreements over the valuation of Future Retail, the flagship of Biyani’s enterprise. Future Retail, meantime, is facing increased liquidity pressure after it missed interest payments on its US dollar-denominated bonds last week. Subsequently, Fitch cut its credit ratings on the company. Promoters own 42% in Future Retail, which runs hypermarket chain Big Bazaar and neighbourhood grocery chain Easyday Club, but 75% of the holding is pledged as on June 30, 2020.  77190095“The board members of Future have finally agreed with the final contours of the deal that was being worked out among the parties. A resolution will be passed over the next few days,” said a person familiar with the development. Biyani is likely to retain the FMCG and residual businesses of Future, the person added. The deal will be financed through a mix of share-swap and cash.Emailed queries sent to RIL and Future didn’t elicit any response till the time of going to press. India’s No. 2 retailer by turnover, Future has been compelled to look for an acquirer after rising debt, falling valuation of its listed entities and a decline earnings due to the pandemic, started to weigh on it. The market value of its listed companies plummeted 74% to Rs 10,464 crore in one year and its debt has exceeded Rs 12,000 crore.The potential deal underlines RIL’s ambitions to dominate the Indian retail sector as it combines the online and offline formats. Once the transaction with Future is concluded, RIL will bring in global partners and investors in Reliance Retail, which, according to Morgan Stanley, is worth $29 billion.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-inches-closer-to-buying-future-groups-retail-biz/articleshow/77188316.cms,1

The Centre's affidavit detailed the massive governmental response to the pandemic situation and why PM Cares Fund money cannot be transferred to National Disaster Response Fund and then took potshots at CPIL.""SC must visit the question as to whether there can be a permanent body set up only to file PILs on issues which the said body subjectively considers to be 'public interest',"" the Centre said. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R S Reddy and M R Shah that the government has not argued CPIL locus standi in the court prior to the bench reserving verdict, and hence he did not want this issue to be decided. However, the Centre said when genuine non-professional PIL petitioners were already before the SC on the same issues, why should CPIL's PIL be entertained.This is not the first time questions have been raised about CPIL being a professional PIL litigant. On January 12, 2016, a bench headed by then CJI T S Thakur had asked Bhushan how filing of PILs could be the sole activity of an NGO or professional body like CPIL, which then had challenged allocation of 4G spectrum to Reliance Industries Ltd's Jio.The bench had said, ""Prashant Bhushan, you have an image of a crusader. But can you become the centre for public interest litigation? Can the system be taken for a ride in such a manner? We cannot allow this. We must be satisfied that you have a committee which scrutinizes the complaints and allows only genuine ones to be converted into public interest litigations. Has this matter been examined by the committee?""""We must have the confidence that when CPIL files a petition, it is not prompted by someone who has a vested interest even though the cause may appear genuine. If a corporate rival gives documents for filing a PIL, will you do it? Why would that corporate source not come out in the open and pursue the litigation in its own name? Why should CPIL be a front for settling corporate rivalry or personal vendetta? CPIL should not become a proxy litigant. It should not become an instrument in the hands of commercial players,"" it had said. But, when it dismissed the PIl on April 8, 2016, the judgment did not delve into this issue.The Centre in its affidavit said on Friday that ""mere criticism by a few may not be enough to undermine a humongous and unprecedented response to the pandemic given by our country, which included the Union and state governments, all local bodies, healthcare and sanitation workers and each individual citizen, in his own way, and who all are real corona warriors.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-there-be-a-body-only-for-filing-pils-centre-asks-sc/articleshow/77287095.cms,2

I think necessary policy steps should be taken with utmost urgency to make 2G a part of history,"" Ambani said.Earlier, Ambani had announced that RIL's telecom arm Jio will strive to make India free of 2G by migrating from feature phones to an affordable smartphone.Reliance Jio has been at loggerheads with Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea over interconnection usage charges that are levied on each outgoing call because of existence of 2G technology.At present, charge of six paise is levied on every outgoing call on to the network of other mobile operators.Ambani said that India took a big flight into the bright future with the advent of mobile services in 1995.He said that the birth of fixed line telephony was a rare moment in history when fiction became a fact, however, it provided only partial freedom of communication.""It did not completely remove the constraint of distance, people needed to communicate from anywhere to anywhere round the clock,"" Ambani said.He said that mobile phones have become affordable beyond all expectations. In 1995, the cost of a call from one cell phone was Rs 24 which comprised Rs 16 for the caller and Rs 8 for the called.""Now voice calls are free without any time limit,"" Ambani said.He said that affordable mobile services have also become democratic and “is no longer a rich man's monopoly, long ago”.""Indeed, no other technological tool in human history has erased the rich-poor divide the way mobile telephony has.

If this gain of Rs 4,966 crore is excluded, then RIL’s profit before tax is lower by 41% to Rs 8,542 crore for Q1 of fiscal 2021. The company’s revenue declined 41% to Rs 91,238 crore as operations were impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Operating profit, too, fell 12% to Rs 21,585 crore in the April through June months due to weak earnings in its petrochemicals and refining businesses. “The severe demand destruction due to global lockdowns impacted our hydrocarbons business, but the flexibility in our operations enabled us to operate at near normal levels and deliver industry-leading results,” said RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani.  77275634The numbers beat Street estimates as most analysts expected RIL to report a lower profit. A Bloomberg poll had estimated a profit of Rs 7,119 crore. Operating profit of RIL’s refining and petrochemicals segments, traditionally the two largest earners, declined 26% and 50% to Rs 3,818 crore and Rs 4,430 crore. Earnings were impacted due to weak demand and lower price realisations. The company’s Jamnagar refinery, the world’s largest, secured a price of $6.3 from every barrel of crude it processed, much lower than what it earned in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Operating profit of retail declined 47% to Rs 1,083 crore, while operating profit of digital services (Jio) rose 55% to Rs 7,281 crore due to an improved average revenue per unit (ARPU) and increased data usage by people while remaining sheltered at homes due to Covid-19. Jio has emerged as the biggest contributor to RIL’s operating profit. Its ARPU was Rs 140 in the June quarter, up from Rs 122 a year ago. ARPU is the total revenue of the telecom operator divided by the number of users on its network. Jio, which was launched in 2016, has 398 million subscribers and saw a data traffic growth of 30% on its network. RIL said that 50% of its retail stores were shut for most part of the June quarter due to cessation of activity during the lockdown, thus impacting earnings. Operating profit of the media unit declined 41% to Rs 27 crore as advertisers slashed spends, while the oil & gas business made an operational loss of Rs 32 crore. Financial services, which RIL recently started to report separately, made an operating profit of Rs 380 crore, up 211% from the year-ago period.

The enterprise value of the retail assets expected to be acquired by RIL stands at around $3 billion, or Rs 22,700 crore, including the debt to be assumed, said sources. The Mukesh Ambani-led RIL is also likely to acquire up to a 10-15% minority stake in the group’s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business Future Consumer, said these sources. “While the deal was expected to close last week, issues over the personal debt at promoter holding companies like Future Corporate Resources have to be resolved as the retail business is the main asset (supporting pledged shares),” said one of the sources briefed on the matter. Nearly the entire 46% stake held by Biyani and his family in Future Lifestyle is pledged, and about 75% of the 42% stake in Future Retail is also encumbered. The multi-tiered transaction will first involve consolidation of the various Future Group assets under multiple entities like Future Retail and Future Lifestyle Fashions, and then a sale to Reliance. Earlier, a stock transaction was being explored, but the deal is now expected to be a cash transaction, said the sources. 77342504Emailed queries to both RIL and Future Group did not elicit a response till the time of going to press.TOI had reported on June 30 that Reliance is nearing a deal to acquire the consolidated retail assets of Future Group.The discussions come as Fitch downgraded Future Retail’s long-term issuer default rating to C after a missed payment of semi-annual interest on bonds last month. Two Future Group units also missed their payments to Franklin Templeton funds, which are winding up. Known as the retail king, Biyani has been looking at options, including stake sales in retail units as well as the insurance joint venture Future Generali. In April, Biyani had got an injunction against UBS and IDBI Trusteeship from selling his pledged shares.According to rating agency ICRA, debt for listed companies of Future Group increased to Rs 12,778 crore as on September 30, 2019 from Rs 10,951 crore as on March 31, 2019.“A deal may close in a week or 10 days if the issues get resolved,” said the second source familiar with the matter. A potential Future-Reliance combine will consolidate Ambani’s presence as India’s largest retailer and comes as Reliance Retail is looking to bring in strategic and financial investors, which the company had announced at its AGM last month. This, after the record $20-billion fund-raise by Reliance’s telecom unit Jio.The move to consolidate physical store operations comes even as Reliance has stepped up focus on its e-commerce initiative JioMart, where it has entered into a commercial agreement with messaging app WhatsApp to reach consumers. Last week, Reliance said that JioMart has reached a peak of 400,000 orders a day already, and claimed it is the largest online grocer in the country.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/biyanis-personal-debt-final-item-in-3bn-ril-future-deal/articleshow/77338405.cms,0

But a handful of customers keep receiving Venezuelan crude under authorizations granted by Washington to exchange the oil for fuel, so no cash payments go to President Nicolas Maduro’s government.In July, Reliance Industries resumed loading Venezuelan crude under a swap deal permitted by the US Treasury Department after a three-month pause.The authorization allowed Reliance to re-emerge as the largest buyer of Venezuelan crude by taking 216,000 barrels per day (bpd) last month, almost half of total exports, according to the data.The second-largest destination for Venezuela’s oil in August was Cuba with almost 66,000 bpd of crude and refined products, followed by Europe with 65,000 bpd. The South American nation, which boasts some of the largest crude reserves on the planet, shipped a total of 17 cargoes last month, the data showed.Fuel imports by the OPEC-member nation increased in August to 53,160 bpd of mainly diesel and gasoil delivered through swaps, according to the data.PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment.PDVSA has in recent months boosted its ship-to-ship operations near the Amuay bay to load tankers at sea, rather than in Jose, its main terminal for oil exports. The number of vessels doing so-called dark voyages to Venezuela - turning satellite transponders off during the loading operation - has also increased, according to the Eikon data.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/venezuelas-oil-exports-rise-in-august-on-sales-to-india-report/articleshow/77878940.cms,0

It will also affect the country’s growing e-commerce economy as RIL’s chairman Mukesh Ambani eyes a bigger play online. The recently announced acquisition will accelerate scaling up of Reliance’s newly launched e-commerce venture JioMart. It will also make it harder for its rivals — Walmart’s Flipkart and Amazon India — to strengthen offline presence for the grocery business, according to a note by Goldman Sachs on Monday. Additionally, this deal, if completed, would mean e-tailers would be left with fewer avenues here to invest in to strengthen their supply chain and logistics network offline. 77860035“ ... we highlight that this acquisition, if completed, would also remove one potential expansion avenue for competitors, especially Amazon and Walmart, who have been looking to bolster their physical presence in retailing in India to strengthen their online business,” the Wall Street powerhouse said. Reports by Kotak and Axis Capital also indicated similar changes in dynamics for the online battle, and that Future’s retail assets will help Reliance in ramping up its online business “meaningfully”. Across various brands and formats like Big Bazaar, Future has 1,736 stores. For example, Amazon India has been using some Big Bazaar outlets to fulfil grocery deliveries for Pantry.JioMart, which so far sells grocery, has seen a peak of 4 lakh daily orders already. This is higher than horizontal rivals like Flipkart or Amazon India as well as vertical platforms like Bigbasket and Grofers. JioMart, which has been scaling operations in the middle of the pandemic, has made deliveries free for all orders without any minimum order size. This, sources said, has helped the company corner new users.“Further, Easyday, which is a small kirana-like neighbourhood store format, can also potentially boost JioMart’s fulfilment capability in the cities that it is present in…We believe these stores can be converted into Reliance-branded outlets and be utilised to carry out JioMart’s hyperlocal operations. Further, Reliance Retail can also get data of these local neighbourhoods and can easily on-board them as JioMart’s customers,” a report from Kotak Institutional Equities said. It added that there are close to 1,000 Easyday, Heritage Fresh and Nilgiris stores in Future’s network, as of December 2019, and some of them, locally for select locations, had started WhatsApp-based ordering. WhatsApp, with 400 million active users, is expected to play a key role for JioMart to smoothen online ordering via the messaging platform, whose parent firm Facebook invested $5.7 billion in Jio Platforms. Amazon India has also been expanding its grocery service too. While its Pantry service was available in 110 cities in May, the company in June said it had expanded Pantry in over 300 cities. JioMart is currently available in 200 cities. ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/will-boost-jiomart-ops-challenge-e-tailers/articleshow/77859980.cms,0

Amazon is a significant shareholder (49%) in a Future Group company, which owns about 10% stake in Future Retail, the largest outfit within the group in terms of turnover and which operates more than 1,000 stores under Big Bazaar, Fbb, Foodhall and Easyday Club brands.  77829125According to the contours of the deal between Future Group and RIL, the former will merge 19 retail and its related back-end infrastructure companies, including Future Retail, into Future Enterprises. This company will then transfer the retail and supply chain businesses to two separate arms of RIL. Had the deal involved the merger of Future Enterprises (excluding non-retail assets) with the arms of RIL, then Amazon would have got a stake in the two outfits. But with the proposed deal structure where RIL acquires Future Group’s retail assets and not its companies, the former has ensured that competitor Amazon is not its shareholder, said Bank of America Securities in a research report. The Future transaction solidifies RIL’s dominance in India’s organised market, which is estimated to be worth $1.3 trillion by 2025 from $700 billion in 2019, according to a February study by Boston Consulting Group and the Retailers’ Association India. It also creates a large entry barrier by removing a sizeable player from the sector that competitors could have acquired to scale up, said a JP Morgan note. Amazon reportedly had plans to increase its stake in Future Retail to 49%, but the deal didn’t materialise. The US e-commerce giant is currently the authorised online sales partner for Future Retail, but the future of this alliance after the deal with RIL couldn’t be ascertained. Both RIL and Future Group haven’t made any comment on what would happen to Future Retail’s existing partnership with Amazon. In the new scheme of things, Amazon will have shares of Future Enterprises after the merger of Future Retail with the latter. Future Retail shareholders, according to the terms of the deal, will receive 101 shares with a face value of Rs 2 each of Future Enterprises for every 10 shares of Rs 2 each held. After the retail assets are transferred to RIL, Future Enterprises will have interests in food and fashion product manufacturing, an insurance joint venture with Generali and textile partnership with NTC Mills. In this entity, RIL will invest Rs 1,600 crore by way of preferential shares and warrants convertible into equity, to acquire a 13% interest. In a presentation released to the stock exchanges, Future Enterprises said that on the manufacturing businesses that would remain in the company there would be added volumes now from RIL’s retail stores and would also gain from JioMart’s digital platform. However, the company makes no mention of Amazon in the presentation.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rils-deal-for-future-retail-biz-blocks-amazon/articleshow/77860035.cms,2

Started by,"BENGALURU: Early-stage venture capital firm 3one4 Capital has launched its new $100 million fund to take bigger and higher number of bets on startups. Started by Siddarth Pai and Pranav Pai, sons of former Infosys CFO TV Mohandas Pai, it has already made the first close of the fund at $40 million from existing and new limited partners (LP) --who put capital in the funds. 3one4 Capital, which has backed startups like meat delivery firm Licious, fin-tech firm Open, said most of the capital would be from Indian investors with some joining from the US and Japan. Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries has been one of its LPs investing in its previous funds, though Pai declined to comment if it has invested in the new fund. This is the third fund focused on early-stage investments while it has two other funds that focus on seed-stage investment and follow-on investments in its existing portfolio. The follow-on investment fund of $55 million, named Opportunity, was closed in December 2019. “We have already started deploying from the new fund. We will do three things differently. We will do a few more companies compared to Fund II, which had 20 companies. We may do 25 this time. Then, we primarily will take larger ownership upfront (over 20%) and will be able to follow our winners for much deeper and longer,” said Pranav Pai, founding Partner and CIO, 3one4 Capital.  The firm primarily focuses on the consumer sector, enterprise software, fin-tech, media content and deep-tech but the pandemic has made some new sectors investable for Pai, sooner than expected. “What we have seen is the pandemic hasn’t necessarily changed how we will invest but it has made some ideas more urgent. For example, if we had waited for three years to build something in the medical devices space, for the market to mature, Covid-19 has made it much more urgent. So, this became an investable opportunity for us,” Pai said, indicating it is in the process of investing in the space. 3one4 Capital’s new fund launch comes when recovery of funding activity is being closely tracked in the industry. According to Pai, early-stage deal flow is rapidly recovering but mid-stage activity hasn’t shown a similar recovery, except instances where startups like Byju’s, Unacademy have closed their fund-raise.

Airtel grew by 6% and Reliance Industries (the parent of Jio) by 0.5%. “Even though this (AGR payment judgement) is some sort of a relief, it would still be extremely difficult for Vodafone Idea to manage its finances due to heavy interest outgo and AGR payment outgo,” Hemang Jani, equity strategist at Motilal Oswal, told TOI. “It’s doubtful on how they would manage their business, unless new money flows into the company.” 77866214A senior industry analyst with a top consulting company said the ""worst seems to be over"" for the company as the uncertainty over its payment tenure and dues is behind it. “The company will now build its business parameters on this reality.

Private equity firm Gaja Capital is in an advanced stage of talks to lead the round at 1MG, while Tata Capital and Europe’s Partners Group are also looking to participate in the deal along with another ‘global private equity major’, said three sources briefed on the matter.The discussions are under way on the final contours of the deal, which may include the total round being completed in tranches, sources aware of the matter said. For Gaja, if the deal with the Gurgaon-based company closes, it will be its first investment from its new fourth fund of around $400 million. 1MG’s existing investors, which include Sequoia Capital and World Bank investment arm IFC, are also expected to participate. “It is looking to raise north of $100 million and the talks have accelerated following the Reliance-Netmeds deal as it would require capital as a standalone player. Around $70 million of new capital has been finalised but 1MG is negotiating for a bigger cheque,” a person aware of the matter said. TOI reported on August 24 how higher stickiness, wider healthcare business has attracted the likes of Reliance and Amazon in the online medicine delivery space. It mentioned PharmEasy is also working with JP Morgan for fund-raise while it is in the middle of acquiring smaller rival Medlife.When contacted, 1MG co-founder and CEO Prashant Tandon, spokesperson for Gaja Capital and Tata Capital declined to comment on the matter. Email sent to Partners Group did not elicit any response.For 1MG’s rivals like Netmeds, now majority owned by Reliance, besides PharmEasy-Medlife, most of their revenue comes from medicine delivery, while they expand to online doctor consultations and lab tests. Tandon recently told TOI that around 50% of its top line is from medicine delivery as it looks to position itself as a broader digital healthcare platform. A report by market research firm Redseer on Sunday said e-pharmacy platforms, including consultation and lab tests, are expected to clock $2 billion in gross sales by March 2021 — with supply chain restoration and rise in new users. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March, 6 million new households tried online medicine taking the total to 9 million households, a recent Ficci-Redseer white paper said. The latest Redseer report said e-pharmacies clocked $1.3 billion in gross sales for the 12-month period ending March 2020.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pe-firm-gaja-capital-may-lead-100m-round-in-1mg/articleshow/77967738.cms,2

Leave to appeal is a formal permission granted by a court to a party to appeal a decision to a higher court.He submitted that he had completed his arguments on behalf of CBI on January 15, but thereafter, the matter could not be heard due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Jain along with advocates Amit Mahajan and N K Matta added that as Justice Sethi will demit the office on November 30, the appeal be heard and decided expeditiously as if the part-heard matter, which has consumed a lot of judicial time, will be heard afresh by another bench it will cost too much to the public exchequer.Meanwhile, the court reserved its order on two separate pleas by two firms, which were acquitted in the 2G scam related money laundering case, seeking release of their properties attached by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Advocate Vijay Aggarwal, representing the two firms, said they were ready to execute an indemnity bond of the value of the properties as a surety and if the appeal by ED is allowed against the acquittal, it will deposit the amount with the agency as equivalent to the properties' value.Jain opposed the pleas saying the high court is yet to decide the ‘leave to appeal' applications of the agencies and till the time they are not decided, hearing an interim plea is “abuse of process of law”.He said the court can keep the firms' applications in abeyance till the time it decides the plea for granting leave to appeal and added that the theory of indemnity bond was completely alien to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).A special court had on December 21, 2017 acquitted Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and others in CBI and ED cases related to the scam.It had acquitted 17 others, including DMK supremo M Karunanidhi's wife Dayalu Ammal, Vinod Goenka, Asif Balwa, film producer Karim Morani, P Amirtham and Sharad Kumar, Director of Kalaignar TV in the ED case.On the same day, the trial court had also acquitted former telecom secretary Siddharth Behura, Raja's erstwhile private secretary R K Chandolia, Unitech Ltd MD Sanjay Chandra and three top executives of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (RADAG) -- Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair, in the CBI's 2G case.Swan Telecom promoters Shahid Usman Balwa and Vinod Goenka and directors of Kusegaon Fruits and Vegetables Pvt Ltd Asif Balwa and Rajiv Agarwal were also acquitted in the CBI case.On March 19 2018, the ED had approached the high court challenging the special court's order acquitting all the accused.A day later, the CBI too had challenged in the high court the acquittal of the accused in the case.

This valuation, when compared with listed companies, ranks the retail unit at the fifth spot in India after HUL, HDFC Bank, TCS and RIL itself. The American fund’s investment in Reliance Retail Ventures (RRVL), a subsidiary of RIL and the holding company of its retail business, sets the pricing benchmark for the consumer-focused unit that is expected to see more external investors in the coming weeks.  78031148In July, Ambani said that he had received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in the retail unit and would be finalising deals in the coming quarters. While Ambani did not specify the total quantum of stake he intends to sell in the retail unit to external parties, he has reportedly offered existing financial investors of Jio Platforms an opportunity to back the retail business.Besides Silver Lake, 10 other US and Middle Eastern asset management firms — including consumer-focused fund L Catterton, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and New York-based KKR — have invested in Jio Platforms, which also runs India’s largest wireless network. Bloomberg reported that KKR and L Catterton are weighing investments in RIL’s retail unit. KKR is looking to invest at least $1 billion in RRVL. Between May and June, Silver Lake ploughed Rs 10,203 crore (for a stake of over 2% in Jio Platforms), while KKR invested Rs 11,367 crore (2.3%) and L Catterton put in Rs 1,895 crore (0.4%) in the digital services company of RIL. The potential deals in RRVL form part of Ambani’s broader plan to take the unit public in the future. Ambani has been ramping up his consumer-focused business, moving beyond the mainstay refining and petrochemical business. In May, he launched online grocery service JioMart and later signed deals to purchase online pharmacy retailer Netmeds and Future Retail. The Silver Lake investment will be used by RRVL to finance the Rs 24,713-crore acquisition of Future Retail. According to several brokerages, the US fund has valued RRVL lower than their estimates. CLSA said the deal is 12% lower than the value it assigned to the retail unit. Established in 2006, RIL’s retail unit is India’s largest and most profitable retail business, spanning everything from groceries to electronics. It reported a profit of Rs 5,448 crore ($726 million) on a turnover of Rs 1.62 lakh crore (about $22 billion) in fiscal 2020. The Future Retail acquisition, once completed, will further widen RIL’s lead as India’s biggest retailer. “Retail will always remain a capital-hungry business and what separates winners from the losers is how deep your pockets are. Capital helps you to create a huge barrier in the digital area and widens your moat,” said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive of consulting firm Third Eyesight.“In the e-commerce space dominated by Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, if anybody can create a dent, it will be Reliance. And since they have a blend of physical and digital presence, unlike other retailers who are not omnichannel, they will be able to increase their scale. They have the backbone and the app layer on it which puts them in a unique position,” Dutta added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-lake-acquires-1-8-in-reliance-retail-for-rs-7500cr/articleshow/78026627.cms,0

Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel and HDFC Bank led the slide, while Kotak Bank, Infosys and TCS cushioned the fall to some extent. On the NSE, the Nifty closed at 11,251, down 254 points or 2.2%.After opening on a flat note, the market witnessed a one-way selloff as European indices opened weak and went into a slide. At one point, the sensex was down 907 points and closed just a tad off the intra-day low. Of the 30 sensex stocks, only three closed with gains.Mid- and small-cap stocks witnessed a stronger selloff with the BSE’s mid-cap index closing 3.4% lower, while the small-cap one closed 3.6% down. The day’s slide also left investors poorer by nearly Rs 4 lakh crore with the BSE’s market valuation now at Rs 153.4 lakh crore. There were reports that, led by HSBC, several global banks had helped launder money across the world. Also, there were indications that the UK could again go for another lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 infections.According to HDFC Securities head (retail research) Deepak Jasani, after the European markets opened, traders were quick to unwind their long positions fearing further weakness. “Asian shares slipped on Monday on fears the global economy may sizzle for a while due to a resurgence of the coronavirus infections in Europe, while fading hopes for US fiscal stimulus also weighed,” Jasani said.

The US","MUMBAI: After Silver Lake invested in Reliance Retail Ventures (RRVL), fellow private equity fund KKR too has decided to back India’s largest retailer. The US firm will pump in Rs 5,550 crore for a 1.3% stake of RRVL, the holding company of billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s retail business. The transaction has valued RRVL at Rs 4.2 lakh crore, similar to the value assigned by Silver Lake.With the KKR deal, Ambani has sold a stake of just over 3% in RRVL to external investors for Rs 13,050 crore. The retail unit, established by Ambani in 2006, is part of his sprawling energy-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries (RIL). The foreign money will help RIL finance its acquisitions (it has recently announced the purchase of Future Retail for Rs 24,715 crore and is in discussions to buy majority stake in a few online startups). It will also aid the assault on rivals Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart in the world’s second-most populous country where the Covid pandemic has accelerated a shift in consumer behaviour from brick-and-mortar retail to e-commerce. 78289903While Ambani had said that he has received strong interest from investors in the retail business, he had not specified the total quantum of stake he intends to sell in RRVL. He has, however, offered existing financial investors of his digital services and telecom unit Jio Platforms an opportunity to invest in the retail business. Both Silver Lake and KKR had invested in Jio Platforms — the former had put in Rs 10,203 crore (translating into a stake of just over 2% in the company), while KKR had infused Rs 11,367 crore (for a 2.3% stake). More investors are expected to check into RRVL as Ambani increases his focus on the consumer business, which will power the conglomerate’s profits in the coming years. L Catterton, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund and Mubadala — the investors in Jio Platforms — are in discussions to acquire a piece of RRVL, which reported a profit of Rs 5,448 crore on a turnover of Rs 1.6 lakh crore in fiscal 2020. The share-sale in RRVL is part of Ambani’s broader plan of taking the consumer business public.The profile of investors who have invested or speculated to invest in Reliance Retail indicates that they see a lot of synergy between Jio Platforms and the retail business of RIL, said an analyst. Powered by Jio Platforms’ technology, JioMart, Reliance’s online grocery service which was launched in May, aims to digitise mom-and-pop stores, called kiranas, with customers.

This is in line with Mukesh Ambani’s call to make 2G “history” in the country, a statement that would involve upgrading millions of subscribers (mainly from Airtel and Vodafone Idea) to the smartphone eco-system.Speaking at the 43rd AGM of RIL a few months back, Ambani had announced new frontiers of expansion in the digital and telecom space where he spoke of ambitious plans in the lucrative handset market. He said Jio was targeting 500 million mobile customers by 2023, promising to bring out highly-affordable 4G and even 5G devices that would run on Android operating system provided by the new partner, Google.“… there are many feature phone users who are waiting… to upgrade to a conventional smartphone… if only it were somehow more affordable. So, we have decided to address this challenge head-on.

The US-based e-commerce major has cited breach of terms due to Future’s sale of its retail assets to Reliance Industries (RIL), two sources aware of the matter said. The move comes after Amazon sent a legal notice to Future Group and a copy of the notice to other relevant authorities like markets regulator Sebi and the stock exchanges, informing them about the matter, which TOI reported in its Thursday edition. SIAC is a not-for-profit organisation offering arbitration services to companies across the globe, which have been enforced in jurisdictions like China, India, the US and the UK. “We have initiated steps to enforce our contractual rights. As the matter is sub judice, we can’t provide details,” a spokesperson of Amazon said, confirming the development. Emails sent to Future Group, SIAC and RIL did not elicit any response.As reported by TOI, the dispute primarily comes from Amazon’s Rs 1,431-crore investment in Future Coupons, which held about 10% stake in the flagship Future Retail, in August last year. As a part of the deal, Biyani had also entered into a restriction on transfer of shares to specified persons and right of first offer of shares (ROFO) to Amazon as well, according to filings made by Future Retail at the time. This list of specified persons included RIL, according to the sources mentioned earlier. The deal gave a right to Amazon to acquire the entire or part of the shares of promoters of Future Retail after 3 years of the deal and before 10 years, in “certain circumstances” and subject to the law.Clearly, Amazon is of the view that Future’s deal in August with RIL’s Reliance Retail violates the e-tailer’s contractual rights and thus it has taken the recent steps against Future Group. This development also comes as Reliance has approached the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for an approval of its Rs 24,713-crore deal to acquire Future Group’s assets.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-future-deal-amazon-seeks-arbitration-in-singapore/articleshow/78562399.cms,1

Experts have termed the measures modest and have called for fresh steps to revive growth, which is expected to contract nearly 10% in 2020-21 due to the impact of the Covid-19 induced lockdown.Asked about the reforms that the government would like to be remembered for, the FM said reforms in the public sector policy, which provide a greater role to the private sector, mark a “directional shift” from socialist baggage.“To realise the policy that we are working (on) and which is likely to come to the cabinet. That there should definitely be a clear cut mention of how the Indian economy has to be …that shift away from socialist baggages that we have been carrying all the while ... some desirable some not so desirable some which are becoming more and more of a burden,” Sitharaman said.Reliance Industries (RIL) chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani, who was one of the panellists at the book launch, said embracing new technologies was key. “Our view was that at the end of the day we got to embrace the technology of the future. The faster we embrace technology, the faster we adopt the new technologies and the future industries will be better off,” Ambani said, while detailing the evolution of his company over the years.Meera Jain, executive director of the Times Group, said, “N K Singh is a true gentleman who has worn several hats over the years — economist, academic, bureaucrat, politician...

","Labelling India as an extraordinary country growing at an incredible scale, energy supermajor BP Plc on October 26 said it is looking to expand its presence in the nation in fuel retailing and mobility solutions, but wanted natural gas to be included in the GST regime. Speaking at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, BP Group chief executive Bernard Looney said his firm in partnership with Reliance Industries Ltd will in the next 4-5 years set up 5,500 retail sites that will not just sell petrol and diesel but also offer mobility solutions like EV charging facility.  &quot;India is an extraordinary country with an extraordinary history, an extraordinary group of people, and with extraordinary ambition,&quot; he said, adding the country has a growing population, and an ambitious agenda to cut emissions. This, he said, was &quot;very, very compelling&quot;.  &quot;Why is India important, because it is India,&quot; he said, adding energy mix in the country could fall from 50 percent coal to 40 percent, while gas and renewables will grow. Looney said India will be the fastest-growing fuel and lubricant market in the next 20 years and his group's venture with Reliance will grow the network of petrol pumps to 5,500 in the next 4-5 years from the current 1,400.  As many as 80,000 jobs will be created in the building of the network, he said, adding the venture will offer mobility solutions under the Jio-BP brand. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports. These have been taken over by the RIL-BP joint venture and will be grown in the future. While petrol pumps will be expanded to 5,500, aviation refuelling facilities will grow to 45. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports.  RIL holds 51 percent in the new joint venture company, while BP has the remaining 49 percent. BP paid about Rs 7,000 crore to acquire the 49 percent stake. This is the third joint venture between Reliance and BP since 2011.  BP had in 2011 bought a 30 percent stake in 21 oil and gas exploration and production blocks of Reliance for $7.2 billion. At that time, another 50:50 joint venture, India Gas Solutions, was set up for sourcing and marketing gas in India. RIL-BP is investing $5 billion in developing the next set of discoveries in the KG Basin D6 block.  &quot;Our production with Reliance will account for 15 percent of India gas production,&quot; he said. Looney said while the company feels the ease of doing business on the ground, India is a complex market.  GST was a welcome federal initiative to ease trade and it will be good if natural gas is included in that. When Goods and Services Tax (GST), which amalgamated 17 different central and state levies like excise duty and VAT, was implemented in July 2017, five products – petrol, diesel, crude oil, aviation turbine fuel, and natural gas, were kept out of its purview for the time being.  This meant that gas users could not set off tax paid on inputs against those on the final product and tax on tax continued, disincentivising the use of the fuel. He said BP has a &quot;deep, trusting relationship&quot; with Mukesh Ambani, chairman of RIL.  On the impact of COVID-19 on oil demand, he said it was too early to say what the true impact was but there would be some impact in the medium to long term. But communities around the world are demanding more affordable, reliable, and clean energy and BP was committed to providing solutions for the same, he said.  Speaking at the same event, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said India is one of the largest markets in the world for energy, but its per capita consumption is just 30 percent of the world average, offering huge potential. &quot;We want to be an important part of India,&quot; he said, adding the French group is investing in setting up LNG import terminal, city gas expansion, and renewable energy projects in the country.

The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) has granted an interim relief in the issue to the Jeff Bezos-led Amazon, for now, two people aware of the matter said. Earlier this month, Amazon had approached SIAC over its dispute with Future Coupons, one of the holding companies of Biyani’s Future Group, where Amazon had invested Rs 1,431 crore, citing breach of terms due to its sale of retail assets to Reliance Industries. This was preceded with a legal notice from Amazon to Future Group citing breach of terms by the latter.While an interim order puts the merger on hold, the matter will continue to be heard at SIAC before the sole arbitrator, former attorney general of Singapore, comes to a decision. Legal experts said, typically, it’s the party dissatisfied with the international arbitration order that takes the matter to Indian courts, but Amazon might have to approach the Indian courts too, depending on the final order.“This was an emergency arbitration hearing, where they (Amazon) sought an interim stay on the merger so that the Future-Reliance deal doesn’t close formally, while the matter is in international arbitration,” a person aware of the development said.The development comes even as Reliance Industries has applied for a clearance with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on its deal with Future Group. Sources aware of the matter said the arbitration proceedings could go on for several weeks before a final order comes. This could also have an impact on banks that have lent to Biyani’s Future Group as the lenders are reportedly worried over their loans turning into non-performing assets (NPAs) owing to arbitration proceedings delaying the merger. “We welcome the award of the emergency arbitrator. We are grateful for the order which grants all the reliefs that were sought. We remain committed to an expeditious conclusion of the arbitration process,” a spokesperson of Amazon said on Sunday. A Future Group spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. A spokesperson of Reliance Retail Ventures (RRVL) said it is informed of the interim order and that it intends to enforce the rights and complete the transaction with Future Group without any delay. “RRVL has entered into the transaction for acquisition of assets and business of Future Retail under proper legal advice and the rights and obligations are fully enforceable under Indian law.

According to sources close to Amazon, Future’s statement is being seen as “antagonistic” by Amazon India, and counter to the contractually agreed-upon method to resolve the dispute. “There are enough provisions for the international arbitration ruling to be enforced in India without approaching the Indian courts. International arbitration was part of the deal between the two companies,” this person added, who is aware of Amazon’s thinking on the matter.However, multiple sources added the latest situation is an indication of Future Group’s plans of approaching Indian courts to challenge the matter. These sources said, at this point, both the parties could end up at Indian courts to enforce or challenge the interim ruling. “The jurisdiction will be Delhi high court, if the matter reaches there. This is definitely an option on the table (for Future),” one of the people mentioned earlier added. A Future Group spokesperson declined to comment beyond its media statement on Monday. “In any enforcement proceedings, FRL would take appropriate steps to ensure that the proposed transaction will proceed unhindered without any delay,” it said. Reliance, which said in August it is buying Future Group assets for Rs 24,713 crore, had issued a similar comment on Sunday, indicating it wants to go ahead with the formal process of closing the deal, currently pending with regulators like the Competition Commission of India (CCI). As of Monday evening, regulators were yet to be informed officially about the SIAC order on the Reliance-Future deal. The SIAC interim order is valid for 90 days. A final order is expected to come before this deadline expires. “As per the advice received by FRL, all relevant agreements are governed by Indian law and provisions of Indian Arbitration Act for all intents and purposes and this matter raises several fundamental jurisdictional issues which go to the root of the matter. Accordingly, this order will have to be tested under the provisions of Indian Arbitration Act in an appropriate forum,” the company added.

Future Coupons holds 7.3 per cent equity in BSE-listed Future Retail Ltd -- that operates popular supermarket and hypermarket chains such as Big Bazaar -- through convertible warrants.The e-commerce giant had dragged Future to arbitration at Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) after the indebted Kishore Biyani group firm signed a pact to sell retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance in August this year.Amazon's argument is that Future violated the contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance.On Sunday, Amazon had won an interim award by the Singapore-based single judge arbitration panel, putting the Future-RIL deal on hold.The deal would help Reliance almost double its footprint as India's largest retailer.With the dispute, Amazon is drawing battle lines with Reliance in the race for India's estimated $1 trillion retail market, where online shopping is gaining ground. It needs the Indian partner to strengthen its foothold after becoming the authorised online sales channel for Future Retail's stores that sell everything from groceries to cosmetics and apparel.The tussle between Future and Amazon comes at a time when Reliance has been bolstering its position in the country's retail segment.Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) -- run by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani -- has been on a fund raising spree and since September, it has raised Rs 37,710 crore crore by selling stake in its retail arm.RRVL operates India's largest, fastest-growing and most profitable retail business spanning supermarkets, consumer electronics chain stores, cash and carry wholesale business, fast-fashion outlets and online grocery store JioMart.It operates about 12,000 stores in nearly 7,000 towns, with 640 million footfalls across core categories of grocery, consumer electronics and apparel. Revenues of RRVL stood at Rs 1.63 lakh crore in FY20.The investments equip Reliance Retail with funds to compete in both offline and online formats. The investments come as the country's retail sector prepares for the upcoming festival season and would help Reliance to launch an assault on rivals such as Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/amazon-writes-to-sebi-bourses-on-future-ril-deal/articleshow/78938988.cms,0

But Looney’s reiteration of the plan signals the global oil industry is pinning its hopes on India to recover from the pandemic’s destructive impact on energy demand.In his concluding remarks on Wednesday, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan pointed out that the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the forum shows his government’s emphasis on securing India’s energy architecture. “We are at such a point when we have to assess the impact of Covid-led disruptions to global energy sector supply chains and calibrate our approach towards strengthening of India’s energy sector.”Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of French major Total, joined Looney in describing India “as one of the world’s largest markets for energy” but pointed out that per capita consumption was just 30% of the global average, which offered “huge potential”.

Peak output of around 28 million standard cubic metres per day is expected by FY24 when all three projects are up and running.R-Cluster will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd while Satellites, which are supposed to begin output from the third quarter of 2021 calendar year, would produce a maximum of 7 mmscmd. MJ field will start production in third quarter of 2022 and will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd.Reliance in November last year auctioned the first set of 5 mmscmd of gas from the newer discoveries in the KG-D6 block by asking bidders to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required.Sources said Reliance had in November set a floor or minimum quote of 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price -- which meant that bidders had to quote 8.4 per cent or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.Considering current average Brent price of $40 per barrel, the gas will cost around $3.36 per million British thermal unit.Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.In the first round of auction in November 2019, Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL bought a majority of volumes on offer. The price at that time came to $5.1-5.16 per unit.But international oil rates have slumped as demand evaporated due to outbreak of coronavirus and lockdowns imposed by countries around the globe.Essar Steel had picked up 2.25 mmscmd in the country's first transparent and dynamic forward auction that lasted about five-and-a-half-hours on November 15, 2019, sources said.Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) picked up 1.2 mmscmd while Adani Group and Mahanagar Gas Ltd bought 0.3 mmscmd, sources said, adding GAIL, acting on behalf of fertiliser companies, bought 0.3 mmscmd of gas.Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) had bought 0.35 mmscmd and 0.10 mmscmd went to Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd (GSFC)/Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd (GNFC), sources said.In all, 15 customers across sectors such as steel, petrochemicals, city gas, glass and ceramic got gas in the tender, they added.In the November 15 auction, bidders quoted between 8.5 and 8.6 per cent slope to corner all of the 5 mmscmd supplies available. This translated into a price between $5.1 per mmBtu and $5.16 per mmBtu at the then prevailing Brent oil price of $60 per barrel.Initially, Reliance had set a floor quote of 9 per cent of dated Brent price, which translated into a gas price of $5.4 per mmBtu at $60 oil price. But consumers saw this as a very high price considering that imported LNG in the spot market is available at around $4 per mmBtu rate currently.To pacify the consumers, Reliance lowered the floor/minimum quote to 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price.Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production in September 2008.While the MA field stopped producing last year, the output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February.Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production. Reliance is the operator of the block with 66.6 per cent interest while BP holds the remaining stake.

Chairman Mukesh Ambani’s net wor,"MUMBAI: An 8.6% crash in the Reliance Industries (RIL) stock on Monday left its investors poorer by nearly Rs 1.2 lakh crore. Chairman Mukesh Ambani’s net worth also went down by Rs 59,100 crore, which pushed him three places down in the world’s rich list to the ninth spot. The day’s crash came on the back of a 7% drop in RIL’s net profit for the July-September quarter and also a sharp cut in its target price by one of the leading foreign brokerages Macquarie. This slide left RIL’s market cap at Rs 12.4 lakh crore — down by nearly Rs 1.2 lakh crore from Rs 13.5 lakh crore on Friday. With a 50.5% holding in India’s largest company, the net worth of Ambani is now a little over Rs 6.3 lakh crore.Monday’s 8.6% crash in RIL to Rs 1,877 also left the stock 21% off its all-time high of Rs 2,368, recorded on September 16, and it’s market cap down by about Rs 3 lakh crore. In intraday trades on the BSE, the stock was down 9.5% at one time to Rs 1,860. 79008158Analysts at brokerage house Macquarie, one of the top ranked among those covering RIL for years, have put in a 42% downside target for the stock, asking its customers to enter the counter at about Rs 1,200. With an ‘underperform’ rating on the stock, Macquarie said it was cutting RIL’s earnings per share for fiscal 2022-23 by 20% and put a one-year target price of Rs 1,320.CLSA, one of the most followed foreign brokerages in Indian market, however, has a target price of Rs 2,250 for RIL. It said that given the recent deal valuations for Jio and the proposed price for its deal with Saudi Aramco for its core business, the current price reflects the value of the stock. “Notwithstanding the long-term opportunity, near-term upside may be capped,” CLSA said. Sensex manages gain of 144 pointsMumbai: Backed by strong results from banks and financials, the sensex on Monday closed 144 points higher at 39,758 points, despite the crash in RIL shares. The day’s upside in the benchmark was led by strong buying in HDFC, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank.

According to sources, Amazon has also filed a caveat in the Delhi high court in a bid to pre-empt Future’s move to challenge the Singapore arbitration ruling, which granted an interim stay on the Reliance-Future deal last month. In fact, Amazon’s caveat was filed before Future Group approached the high court earlier this week with a caveat against the US-based e-tailer, sources confirmed. A caveat is a notice submitted in anticipation by a person or an entity, informing the court that another person or entity may file a lawsuit or application against them. It says that the court should give the caveator (the person who has filed the caveat) a fair hearing before deciding on the matter brought in front of it. For now, both the parties have submitted caveats and neither of them have filed a case officially. In an exchange filing on Sunday, Future Group had said it was considering all legal options to protect its rights. “Amazon had already filed the caveat to make sure Future does not get an interim ruling from the high court in their favour with regards to the emergency international arbitration award,” a person aware of the matter said. TOI had previously reported that sources close to Amazon believe there are enough provisions to enforce the Singapore interim order in India without getting a similar direction from a court here.When contacted, spokespersons of Amazon India and Future Group declined to comment on the matter.The latest development is only adding to the rift playing out between the Kishore Biyani-led Future Group and Jeff Bezos-led Amazon. While Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries is not party to any of the proceedings yet, it has issued a statement saying it wants to close the Rs 24,713-crore deal to acquire Future Group’s assets “without any delay”.The international arbitration order, which has asked Future Group to hold on to the merger process before proceeding further, is valid for 90 days.

Gold leafing of three bigger “kalash” around the dome is currently on. RIL’s jewellery division has been assigned to carry out the project,” an RIL source here said on Thursday.“The gold leafing work of the dome is at an advanced stage. With the blessings of Maa Kamakhya, we hope to finish the task in the next two weeks,” the insider said.“Atop the main structure of the temple, situated on Nilachal hills here, a copper-framed design has been prepared and golf leafing on it is going on,” he added.“The makeover of the temple with gold will make it more attractive,” Mohit Chandra Sarma, doloi (head) of the Kamakhya Temple Trust Board, said.“The temple was reopened recently after many months because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Devotees will see something grand when they come here to offer their prayers. We expect a rise in the number of visitors because of the makeover,” he said.Work on decorating the dome began soon after the board received a proposal from RIL in September. “Himanta Biswa Sarma (state minister for health) who is an ardent follower of Maa Kamakhya, played a key role in drawing Ambani’s attention to the beautification of the temple,” a temple source said.Though RIL insiders did not wish to divulge the cost of the project, market estimates suggested an investment of more than Rs 10 crore.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/reliance-industries-limited-golden-touch-for-kamakhya-temple/articleshow/79073563.cms,2

At Thursday’s close, the sensex is finally above the levels seen before Covid’s outbreak — also its eight-month high mark. On February 19, the sensex had closed at 41,323 and the massive slide that took it to a multi-year low of 25,639 points on March 24 had started the next day.Thursday’s rally also took BSE’s market capitalisation to Rs 161.1 lakh crore, its highest ever level. Since February 19 till now, investors’ wealth, as measured by the BSE’s m-cap, has increased by about Rs 3 lakh crore.During the day’s session, Reliance Industries and financials led the rally that was across the board with all of the 30 sensex stocks closing higher, which is a rarity. The sessions also witnessed strong foreign fund buying with the net inflow figure at Rs 5,368 crore, while domestic funds were net sellers at Rs 2,208 crore, BSE data showed.There are some in the market who believe that a split verdict in the US — a Democratic president with a Republican-majority Senate — is good for the global economy and the market. “Investors across the globe appear happy that there may not be a ‘Blue wave’ outcome in the US elections,” HDFC Securities head (retail research) Deepak Jasani said. “If Republicans hold the Senate, they will want to stop what they see as the Joe Biden ‘spending agenda’ and ‘runaway federal debt’, which will mean less fiscal stimulus and no corporate tax increases. A divided US government is likely to be a favourable outcome for most asset classes,” Jasani said.Although the sensex is now less than 3% away from its all-time high level of 42,274 points, market players warned of volatility ahead. The prevailing volatility will continue in line with global indices until there is a clear winner in the US presidential elections, Religare Broking VP (research) Ajit Mishra said. “However, the recent buoyancy in the banking pack on the domestic front is certainly encouraging. But that might also take a breather after the recent surge.”On Friday, market players here expect another session of gains, again because of the strong rally on Wall Street on Thursday night.

The move follows PIF’s earlier investment of Rs 11,367 crore in Reliance Retail’s sister company Jio Platforms. Through that investment, PIF had acquired a 2.3% share in Jio, which was the star contributor to parent Reliance Industries’s second quarter operating profit amid the pandemic. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with whom RIL has a “long-standing relationship”, will be the eighth investor in Reliance Retail, which has mobilised Rs 47,265 crore since September 9. About 11% of Reliance Retail will be in the hands of foreign investors once all the transactions are concluded. PIF’s Rs 9,555-crore investment is the biggest external capital commitment Reliance Retail has received. US-based Silver Lake had committed Rs 9,375 crore in Reliance Retail for a 2.1% stake. PIF’s investment has assigned Reliance Retail a valuation of Rs 4.6 lakh crore ($62 billion), which is 7% higher than the valuation given by the previous investor Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. The latest enterprise value sets a benchmark for Reliance Retail and will help RIL as it plans to take the unit public in the future. Saudi Arabia’s investment in Reliance Retail comes after a deal inked by the latter has been mired in a legal dispute. RIL, however, said that it will go ahead with the Rs 24,713-crore acquisition of Future Retail, despite Amazon’s objections. Besides Reliance Retail, PIF plans to invest Rs 3,779 crore in RIL’s fibre-optic assets. The share-sale in Reliance Retail reflects RIL’s bet on the India consumer story as it reduces its dependence on industrial segments. In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, RIL saw operating profit of its refining and petrochemicals businesses fall by 49% and 33%. India’s retail sector, one of the largest in the world, accounts for over 10% of its gross domestic product (GDP), which presents “meaningful growth potential”, said the joint release by PIF and RIL.

To stress his argument, Raja’s lawyer cited a testimony recorded by original IO of the CBI before thr trial court.Apart from Raja, other acquitted persons, ex telecom secretary and businessman Rajiv Agarwal have also targeted the agency for filing incomplete appeal.The duo had earlier argued that the agency ""has not placed on record the copies of the complete record of the due process to be complied as per CBI manual including report of public prosecutor and Director of Prosecution submitted to the central government for mandatory approval to file appeal against acquittal and not placed any direction of either Solicitor General Tushar Mehta or CBI counsel Sanjiv Bhandari to prefer leave to appeal/appeal.”They have argued that in the absence of such documents, any prior approval granted by the central government would be without application of mind.Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain has maintained for CBI that the trial court verdict acquitting all accused was challenged as an opinion was received that “it is a fit case to prefer an appeal.” The agency had said that the opinion was received from the Ministry of Law and Justice which examined the proposal of the probe agency to file a criminal appeal. The CBI had said that it was apprised through a letter by the Department of Personnel and Training in January 2018 that the law and justice ministry opined that “it is a fit case to prefer an appeal”. HC is conducting day-to-day hearing on CBI’s ‘leave to appeal’ against the acquittal of all the individuals and firms. After finishing submissions in the CBI case, the high court will take up the ED’s money laundering case in which also all the accused were acquitted by the special court. Leave to appeal is a formal permission granted by a court to a party to challenge a decision in a higher court.A special court had on December 21, 2017 acquitted Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and others in the CBI and the ED cases related to the scam. Besides Raja and Kanimozhi, the special court had acquitted Behura; Raja''s erstwhile private secretary R K Chandolia; Unitech Ltd MD Sanjay Chandra and three top executives of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (RADAG) -- Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair, in the 2G case filed by the CBI.

Four years later, he’s deploy","NEW DELHI: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani obliterated rivals in telecommunications sector by selling $2 data plans and free voice calls. Four years later, he’s deploying a very similar tactic -- cutthroat pricing -- to gain an edge in the country’s increasingly competitive e-commerce space.As India this week hits the peak of its biggest shopping season, the festival of Diwali, the tycoon’s retail websites -- including JioMart -- are elbowing their way into a space long dominated by Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc’s local unit Flipkart Online Services Pvt.Ratcheting up competition, Ambani’s portals are offering blockbuster discounts of as much as 50% on popular sugary confections and other holiday staples like spice mixes for India’s rice delicacy, biryani. Meanwhile, his Reliance Digital website is selling some flagship Samsung smartphones at prices cheaper than rivals, with as much as 40% rebates.It’s a push that comes as Ambani’s sprawling conglomerate, Reliance Industries Ltd, is flush with cash. After raising an eye-popping $20 billion for its technology venture, it’s shifted fundraising to its retail arm, which has won over $6 billion in investment in recent weeks from heavyweights like KKR & Co. and Silver Lake. Already India’s biggest brick-and-mortar retailer, Ambani’s online ambitions pit him against the two US giants, both of which have invested big in India.The country, one of the last big consumer markets, is still up for grabs, and Morgan Stanley estimates that India will generate $200 billion in e-commerce sales by 2026. Yet, the billionaire’s triumphs in telecommunications -- where he started as a tiny player, but outpaced established rivals by undercutting them on price and capitalizing on regulatory changes -- are a cautionary tale for the American giants.Huge edgeIn retail, Ambani’s firm has a huge edge: Government policies are increasingly stacked in favor of domestic retailers, of which Reliance is the largest. Since the end of 2018, India’s foreign investment rules have also barred Amazon and Walmart’s local unit Flipkart from featuring exclusive products and owning inventory, in a bid to restrict their ability to directly influence prices and offer discounts. International companies aren’t allowed to own more than 51% of local brick and mortar supermarket chains. Even that limit is subject to conditions such as setting up only in cities with populations of less than 1 million.With his local strategy, low-cost procurement and chain of brick-and-mortar stores, Ambani has the ability to shake up online retail, said Siju Narayan, chief experience Oofficer, RexEmptor Consult LLP in Mumbai. “JioMart can dent the fortunes of grocery e-commerce majors like Bigbasket & Grofers,” he said, referring to the country’s biggest online grocers. “And impact the grocery, home & personal care category of e-tail majors like Amazon and Flipkart in coming days.”Representatives for Reliance and Bigbasket declined to comment, while those for Walmart, Amazon and Grofers didn’t respond to requests for comment.Tweaked rulesAmbani’s success in telecom shows his ability to benefit from pricing and policy. The government tweaked rules in 2013 to create a “unified license” that allowed operators with a broadband wireless permit to offer voice calls by paying a one-time fee. Only one operator had such a permit nationwide at that time – Reliance Jio. The new rules helped it move swiftly.After receiving a unified license and rolling out Reliance Jio’s telecom services in September 2016, Ambani sold voice and data plans at rock bottom prices. That made digital services more affordable for millions of Indians. Although rivals won similar licenses, some went bankrupt amid the ensuing price war, including his younger brother Anil’s Reliance Communications Ltd. Non-state operators in telecommunications eventually dropped to three from at least a dozen. Jio turned profitable in 2018. It’s currently India’s biggest wireless operator with over 400 million subscribers.High stakesIn India, the stakes are high for the American retailers. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s hard-charging founder and chief executive officer, has pledged to invest $6.5 billion there. Walmart spent $16 billion in 2018 to acquire Indian portal Flipkart in its biggest ever deal, and has invested over $1 billion this year in the e-tailer and steadily plowed cash into its sister unit, payments service PhonePe.But for Ambani, 63, Asia’s richest man with a net worth of $78 billion, the e-commerce push may turn out to be tougher than telecom. First, he will be up against formidable rivals. The wireless operators he defeated were mostly homegrown players, lacking the heft, experience and deep pockets of Amazon or Walmart. Also his group’s e-commerce websites are newer compared to its rivals’.Reliance group’s JioMart – which only started this year and is still in the beta phase – has had delivery snafus and refund delays, and some users haven’t been shy about venting on Twitter. All that means winning big against Walmart and Amazon could take years.Future businessYet, getting it right is key because Ambani has cast retail and technology as the future of Reliance, which got its start in textiles under his father and then progressed into petrochemicals and oil refining. Two of his oldest children, Ivy-league educated twins Isha and Akash, are on the board of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd.Reliance is already the biggest company and its market capitalization of $185 billion equals about 6.6% of India GDP. Its heft would only increase if it wins a greater foothold in e-commerce -- something that’s increasingly becoming important in India, which has suffered a lockdown for much of the year due to the pandemic and where organized retail is yet to penetrate rural corners.The pandemic is offering a boost to Reliance because many local stores can’t offer aggressive discounts due to financial difficulties, said Laiji Varghese, who runs a provision store in Nerul, a town in the outskirts of Mumbai, and has a partnership with Reliance to deliver orders.“Reliance Retail is a big bulk player with deep pockets,” she said. “They have the financial muscle to offer such discounts compared to others.”Samsung phonesFor Diwali, JioMart has a “Bestival Sale” on and has been touting the “season’s biggest grocery sale” with large discounts and cashback running through November 8. Flipkart and Amazon are also showcasing a slew of discounts, putting the three companies neck to neck.Yet on some key items, Ambani’s sites are offering bigger price cuts. A Samsung S20, this year’s flagship model from the world’s biggest smartphone maker, for instance, was going for 43,999 rupees at the start of this week on Reliance Digital. The same phone on Amazon’s India website was available for 47,990 rupees and on Flipkart for 69,999 rupees.Regardless of who draws more customers and offers the biggest price cuts this holiday season, a pitted, protracted battle for India’s online shoppers is likely to play out in the coming years.Complex restrictionsDespite the complex pricing restrictions that Walmart and Amazon face in India, they have been able to showcase discounts offered via manufacturers and brands. In some cases, they are able to restructure their relationships with sellers so they can legally offer price cuts, and have allied with banks and credit card companies, which are allowed to offer deals that give shoppers price benefits on websites.Yet, in the long term, pricing rules favoring local companies would allow Ambani’s JioMart and other websites to be more nimble in tweaking costs since they are bound by fewer restrictions.JioMart and Reliance Retail account for around $12 billion of India’s retail market combining brick and mortar and digital sales, according to Ankur Bisen, senior vice president and head of Technopak’s retail consulting division. Meanwhile, Amazon and Flipkart, leveraging their pure online plays, can claim about $14 billion each, he said.Although Amazon and Walmart are far ahead in online retail, a winner will need to straddle both domains, physical and virtual, to cater to India’s diverse and heavily rural geography. Yet the restrictions on foreign companies owning grocery stores, puts them on a backfoot. That’s in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s goal of nurturing home-grown champions. Across the border, China’s protection of domestic companies has created technology behemoths like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd.Ambani has built his businesses with a decades-long understanding of India’s bargain-hungry consumers. Over the years, he’s also aligned Reliance’s own ambitions with government goals across different administrations. In 2016, when he launched Reliance Jio, the telecom business, he promoted it as part of Modi’s Digital India initiative.India’s Alibaba“Narendra Modi has clearly decided that he wants to produce an Indian equivalent of Alibaba or Tencent, and he knows Reliance is the only plausible candidate,” said James Crabtree, an associate professor of practice at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, author of The Billionaire Raj, which chronicles India’s economic opening and has Ambani’s much-storied Mumbai home on its cover.To cement his position as the nation’s No. 1 retailer, Ambani bought the retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units of Future Group for $3.4 billion in August. Amazon, which owns a tiny stake in one of the unlisted firms under the Future Group, has sought to block the sale in an arbitration court. Reliance, meanwhile, said it intends to complete the transaction without any delay.“It’s a head-on competition in online retail,” said Devangshu Dutta, CEO of retail consultancy Third Eyesight. “An extremely well capitalized, very aggressive player is the new challenger.” ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/asias-richest-man-takes-on-amazon-in-indias-booming-online-market/articleshow/79176817.cms,2

JioMart, a part of RIL’s retail arm Reliance Retail, has stepped in to help the brick-and-mortar retail chain with fresh stock. A purchase order has been signed last week and goods from Reliance Retail are set to replenish shelves at Big Bazaar stores across India, sources said.The move comes at a time when Kishore Biyani-led Future Group is locked in a bitter legal feud with Seattle-headquartered Amazon over the sale of its retail and wholesale assets, including 1,550 Big Bazaar stores, to RIL for around Rs 24,700 crore. “RIL’s move to bail out Big Bazaar exudes the confidence both companies have in closing the deal despite Amazon’s legal moves against it,” said a person familiar with the development. While Future Group did not comment on this matter, an RIL spokesperson, too, did not respond to an emailed query.Amazon, which owns 49% stake in one of Future Group’s unlisted companies — Future Coupons — claimed that the deal that was announced in August violated contractual agreements between the e-tailer and Biyani’s conglomerate, which operates several retail chains across India, including, FBB, Foodhall, EasyDay and WHSmith apart from Big Bazaar. “Future Group has started talking to its old suppliers, too, apart from taking supplies from JioMart,” said a person close to Future Group. “But Amazon’s legal proceedings have complicated things further for its lenders.”Future Retail on Saturday filed a suit in the Delhi high court seeking relief against Amazon from interfering in the deal. Future argued that Amazon was “misusing” the interim award passed by the emergency arbitrator of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in October that has put the RIL-Future deal on hold.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-helps-cash-strapped-big-bazaar-restock-shelves/articleshow/79158886.cms,1

Th,"NEW DELHI: A legal spat between Amazon.com Inc and its Indian partner that started before an arbitrator in Singapore just got fiercer in a court in New Delhi.The US e-commerce giant and Future Group, whose assets billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd recently agreed to buy for $3.4 billion, are locked in a dispute over that deal. Amazon says Future violated a contract with the sale to its rival and wants to halt it, while the indebted Mumbai-based firm says it would collapse if the transaction were to fail.The Jeff Bezos-led e-tailer has accused Future and its founder Kishore Biyani of flouting disclosure rules, according to court filings seen by Bloomberg. Future’s disclosures were “made as per the applicable requirements,” the company said in an email, refuting the allegations. Amazon has also written to the Competition Commission of India asking it not to approve the takeover until arbitration proceedings are complete.While Amazon, Future and Reliance await a verdict, the legal wrangling is threatening to unravel India’s biggest retail acquisition. But why is the world’s largest e-commerce company seeking to derail a deal that’s essentially bailing out a beleaguered retailer, whose market valuation is barely 2% of its own? Here’s what we know so far:1. What led to the feud?Amazon, in early October, accused its partner Future Group of breaching terms of a mutual agreement by announcing an asset sale deal with Reliance, the conglomerate helmed by Asia’s richest man.Amazon had bought 49% in one of Future’s unlisted firms last year, with the right to buy into the listed flagship Future Retail Ltd. after a few years. But the retailer ran into a severe cash crunch when India went into a lockdown in March to curb the coronavirus outbreak.In May, Amazon was considering increasing its stake in Future Retail, people familiar with the matter said at the time. But no such transaction materialized quickly and Future cut a deal with Reliance, infuriating Amazon. The U.S. firm claims that its contract with the unlisted Future unit barred a transaction with a number of persons and companies, including Ambani and Reliance.2. What’s the fight really about?The fight is essentially for the dominance of India’s estimated $1 trillion consumer retail market. Future Group is caught in the middle of this tussle between companies helmed by two of the world’s richest men.Reliance is already the country’s biggest brick-and-mortar retailer. Acquiring Future’s retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units would almost double its footprint and give it unparalleled edge over rivals -- an advantage Amazon is not willing to cede. Blocking Reliance is crucial for Amazon if it wants to hold sway over the only billion-people plus consumer market still open to foreign firms. It has pledged to invest $6.5 billion, a sign of its commitment to the Indian market.3. What did the Singapore arbitration court say?After accusing Future of breaching its contract, Amazon secured emergency relief from an arbitration court in Singapore on Oct. 25 that temporarily restrained Future Group from going ahead with the asset sale.Future and Reliance maintain that the Singapore court’s interim ruling is not binding, but Amazon wrote to local regulators flagging it as a binding order. Reliance has said it intends to buy Future’s assets “without any delay.” Future Group said the matter “will have to be tested” under Indian laws.Future Retail has now petitioned the Delhi High Court urging it to bar Amazon from meddling in its asset sale by writing to local antitrust and market regulators. Amazon’s lawyer told the court that Future’s petition is not legally tenable. Reliance’s retail units are supporting Future and have their lawyers in the court hearings.4. What are the arguments by the two sides?Future’s lawyers said that Future Retail -- the entity selling the assets -- was not part of the contract between Amazon and the unlisted group firm in which the U.S. e-tailer acquired a stake. Amazon’s counsel argued that both the Future firms were controlled by the same owners.Future Group’s lawyers have argued that its existence hinges on the sale to Reliance, and an aborted deal would result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. They are casting Future as an Indian retailer that’s being driven to bankruptcy by a global giant.Amazon has hinted that this spat is about India’s willingness to enforce business contracts. If Future is allowed to renege on a contract, it’ll mean business contracts are not sacrosanct and investments in India are risky -- an inconvenient image as the nation looks to lure foreign investment.5. Who is representing the parties?A battery of India’s highly-paid top legal brains are arguing for the two sides, showing the high stakes involved in the case. More than 50 lawyers represented the companies, Biyani and his family in the Indian court in the first two days of the hearing -- some of them video conferencing from their London homes or farm houses on the outskirts of New Delhi.Some of the legal hot shots include India’s former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, two former solicitor generals Harish Salve and Gopal Subramanium as well as former additional solicitor general and politician, Abhishek Manu Singhvi.6. Who’s hanging by the thread awaiting a verdict?Future Retail and the group at large, since their survival depends on it. The group defaulted on obligations earlier this year. Future Retail has posted massive losses for two straight quarters and its shares have plunged 80% this year. The retailers is reporting its latest quarterly earnings on Friday.The firm will run into financial trouble if the deal fails, its lawyer Salve told the court. Amazon is willing to “sink the ship” but doesn’t want Reliance to acquire Future’s assets, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-amazon-is-feuding-with-a-partner-and-mukesh-ambani/articleshow/79207473.cms,1

Such never-seen-before volatility came on the back of a series of record-breaking intra-day slides in the market with the highest ever recorded on March 23 when the sensex crashed a little over 4,000 points.The year also witnessed the sensex crashing to a multi-year low at 25,639 points on March 24, but what was remarkable was that it closed at an all-time high with investors’ wealth, measured by BSE’s market capitalisation, also at an all-time peak of Rs 167.2 lakh crore.79223683According to Arun Kejriwal, director, KRIS, an investment advisory firm, the sensex finally settling 11% or about 4,400 points up on the year reflects the remarkable resilience of the Indian market since in mid-year, it had gone down to 25,600 level. “The market’s recovery from the Covid-induced hardships is significant since the macro-economic picture has not improved much,” Kejriwal said.The market has mainly rallied on the back of a global deluge of liquidity with foreign funds net pumping in over Rs 1 lakh crore into the stock market over the year.The quarterly numbers by India Inc have also shown very strong growth, mainly on the back of tough measures to cut costs at all levels, market players said.“This recovery has come on the back of several measures put forward by the government, aimed at kickstarting the economy through a string of incentives, reliefs and stimulus. The impact of all these will not be felt instantly but over the medium and long term,” Kejriwal said.Some of the industries have shown a sharp recovery in the last few months, after the nationwide lockdown was relaxed in June, while some are being helped by the government. For example, there was a revival of the auto sector, mainly two-wheeler and entry-level cars, primarily because of the need for personal safety during the pandemic, analysts said. This buoyancy could continue for 3-4 quarters, they said.On the other hand, the government on Thursday announced a string of measures that could boost the revival of the real estate sector, which is under tremendous pressure in most of the metros. Once construction resumes in earnest, it would generate demand for workers and also give a boost to construction materials, industry players said. In Samvat 2077, market players now expect some measures to boost sectors like tourism, travel, airlines, etc.On an individual corporate level, Samvat 2076 will be remembered as a stand-out year for Reliance Industries and its chairman Mukesh Ambani. During the year, RIL became the first Indian entity to break within the top 50 most valued company in the world while Ambani’s personal networth had placed him among the top five richest globally. It also saw investments by two of the global technology giants, Facebook and Google, along with several other large sovereign funds and private equity majors.The year also saw TCS, the flagship of the Tata Group, become the most valued technology services company in the world, ahead of Accenture and IBM.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/samvat-2076-sensex-up-11-amid-high-volatility-and-a-record-crash/articleshow/79217261.cms,0

It cut a deal with Reliance Industries to sell assets for Rs 24,713 crore, infuriating Amazon.The US firm claims that its contract with the unlisted Future Copouns Ltd (FCL) barred a transaction with a number of persons and companies, including Ambani and Reliance.The lawyers and analysts said Amazon invested not in FRL but in a company owned and controlled by Kishore Biyani namely Future Coupons Ltd (FCL), which was carrying on the business of wholesale trading of goods and merchandise and marketing and distribution of corporate gifts cards, loyalty cards, and reward cards to corporate customers.But that the August 22, 2019 shareholders' agreement gives FCL critical control rights over the management and affairs of FRL, including a bar on selling any retail asset without its approval and a bar on selling assets to any restricted persons.This, they said, tantamounts to Amazon getting 'control rights' in FRL even though the law does not provide for that.Amazon on the other hand feels it didn't have any operational control over FRL and the agreement only tries to protect its investments. The agreement was disclosed to Sebi as well as the Competition Commission of India (CCI).Sources, however, said the 'control' was in violation of the law as FDI is permitted in multi-brand retail with government approval and with a lot of restrictions such as 50 per cent of the funds being invested in backend infrastructure, mandatory local sourcing of goods and services, a bar on retail trading by means of e-commerce and multi-brand retail being allowed only in certain states.Amazon did not reply to a detailed email sent seeking comments.The charge of foreign control over the multi-brand retailer is being sought to be dismissed by pointing to 12.3 per cent foreign portfolio ownership in FRL.Amazon invested Rs 1,430 crore to acquire 49 per cent equity in FCL. 51 per cent is held by Biyani.FCL, in turn, holds 9.82 per cent voting in FRL.FDI is permitted under automatic route in FCL. The FDI laws allow FCL to hold the shares of FRL only as long as FCL is owned and controlled by Indian residents namely Biyani, the sources said.They said Amazon chose to invest in FCL - a non-multibrand retail business venture, where FDI is allowed under the automatic route.If 'control' is read, as is sought by Amazon now, Amazon's investment would be treated as a violation of FDI policy, they added.Besides, it would have also triggered an obligation on both Amazon and promoters of FRL to make an open offer to all of the FRL public shareholders, they said, adding the approval of 3,00,000 plus FRL public shareholders was not sought for the Amazon deal.Amazon contends that it could have invested up to 9.9 per cent in FRL under the Foreign Portfolio Investment Route and that under the current transaction if conflated, Amazon merely held 4.81 per cent in FRL through FCL (49 per cent of FCL's shareholding in FRL i.e. 9.82 per cent).Amazon further contends that along with the 4.81 per cent it only held 'protective rights' / 'passive rights' in FRL, which do not amount to 'control'.The sources said this is contrary to submissions before the Emergency Arbitrator where Amazon contended that it has ""protective, special and material rights"" with respect to FRL's retail assets through FCL.Amazon says Future violated a contract with the sale to Reliance, while the indebted Mumbai-based firm says it would collapse if the transaction were to fail.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/amazon-seeking-to-exercise-control-over-future-retail-without-owning-a-stake/articleshow/79289645.cms,1

Its business includes supermarkets, consumer electronics chain stores, cash and carry wholesale business, fast-fashion outlets, and online grocery store JioMart.The investments equip Reliance Retail with funds to compete in both offline and online formats as well as giving ammunition for battle against rivals such as Walmart-owned e-commerce company Flipkart and Amazon.The new funding came weeks after Reliance acquired the retail, wholesale, logistics and warehouse business of Future Group for an enterprise value of Rs 24,173 crore to consolidate its dominant market positioning in offline retail.The deal however is being challenged by US e-commerce giant Amazon, which had taken a stake in Future's unlisted entity.Earlier, Reliance raised an unprecedented Rs 1.52 lakh crore for Jio Platforms, the group's telecom and digital services company, from investors such as Facebook, Intel and Google.The oil-telecom-to-retail conglomerate intends to divest minority stakes in its digital and retail businesses, and hold initial public offering for each within five years.Reliance Retail in May this year launched JioMart, an e-commerce venture, to connect mom-and-pop stores, called Kirana, with consumers.Isha Mukesh Ambani, director of RRVL, said the company looks forward to working with its partners after the ""phenomenal interest"" shown by them.""With our focus on new commerce, we are committed to playing a transformational role in the Indian retail sector by empowering millions of merchants and micro, small and medium enterprises,"" she said.Isha is the daughter of the richest Indian, Mukesh Ambani.

The mega transaction cements the position of Reliance Retail as the undisputed leader in the organised retail segment and adds muscle to its ongoing battle with Amazon for the Indian e-commerce market.  Reliance Retail-Future Group deal: RIL unit adds Future Group’s retail business to shopping cart for Rs 24,713 crore.   The Future Group houses leading retail formats, including supermarket chain Big Bazaar, upmarket food stores Foodhall, and bargain clothing chain Brand Factory. The acquisition is being done as part of a scheme in which Future Group is merging certain companies carrying on the aforesaid businesses into Future Enterprises Ltd (FEL).  The announcement comes as a setback to Amazon.com which has claimed that Future Group violated its agreement with the US e-commerce giant by entering into the deal with RIL.  Amazon had moved the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in October and won an interim stay on the deal. The SIAC passed the interim order asking Future Group to hold its plans of selling its retail business to RIL on October 25.   Amazon, last year, had bought a 49 per cent stake in one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd, with the right to buy into FRL after a period between three and 10 years. Future Coupons owned a 7.3 per cent stake in Future Retail.  Along with this, Amazon even wrote to market regulator SEBI, stock exchanges and CCI seeking a stay on the deal.  Later, Kishore Biyani-led Future Retail Ltd (FRL) on November 7 moved the Delhi High Court against Amazon.com for interfering in its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Industries (RIL) by misusing the arbitration order passed by SIAC.

Reliance Retail also said its success in bringing such a huge repertoire of traditional handcrafted products to its modern retail formats is also an indication of the existence of demand for such products, as long as consumers’ expectations of quality, style, and convenience of modern retail buying can be met.  The fashion and lifestyle arm of Reliance said its 'Indie range' (Indie by AJIO) is sourced from over 50 GI crafts clusters from across Indian states - including Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.  With this geographical indication tag, natural produce, handicrafts, or manufactured goods are identified native to a territory, region, or locality for their unique characteristics.  &quot;The diversity of sourcing from across the length and breadth of India has resulted not only in the creation of a stunning portfolio that is every handcraft connoisseur’s dream, but also in the direct employment for over 30,000 skilled artisans across the country. We will continue to grow this segment with time,&quot; Akhilesh Prasad said.  Reliance Retail's other brand 'Swadesh' has an MoU with the Ministry of Textiles which enables the sourcing of 100 percent authentically crafted products, directly from artisan communities.

Amazon is a business partner of Future and argues the Indian firm’s asset sale breached some of their pre-existing agreements.Amazon had complained to stock exchanges, accusing Future of misleading public by making incorrect market disclosures, allegations the Indian group denies.The complaint came after Amazon on October 25 won an injunction from an arbitrator to halt the Future-Reliance deal.Previously unreported e-mails exchanged between the NSE and Future show the stock exchange repeatedly requested the company submit more details of the arbitration order, seeking details of possible impact on financials, lenders and the Reliance deal.On October 27, NSE asked Future why it had not disclosed the commencement of the arbitration proceedings and not shared the impact of the order. Future in response said it believed a disclosure wasn’t required.NSE’s listing compliance division rejected that argument. It demanded a series of disclosures be made within hours, “failing which appropriate actions may be initiated”, the emails showed.Future Retail’s Company Secretary, Virendra Samani, answered most of NSE’s queries in a late night e-mail on October 30, saying it was doing so “in the best interest of all stakeholders”, the communications showed.Many of those responses were made public on directions of the NSE two days later in a six-page exchange filing by Future.Before that, Future had only submitted a disclosure on October 26 in which it attached a media release saying it would ensure its deal with Reliance proceeded unhindered and that it was reviewing the arbitration order.The NSE and Future Retail did not respond to requests for comment.The legal dispute has now reached the Delhi High Court, where Future Retail has urged the court to stop Amazon from writing letters to regulators to block its Reliance deal, which is pending approvals from the market regulator and stock exchanges. The judge is expected to rule on the plea in the coming days.Amazon had separately asked India’s market regulator to investigate Future for insider trading, saying it disclosed to Reliance price sensitive details of the arbitration order before its exchange filing in late October.Future has said its communications with Reliance, which is led by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, were for a “legitimate purpose”.NSE in e-mails at least twice asked Future Retail to provide a copy of the arbitration order to vet the disclosures, and also why it should not be disclosed as material price-sensitive information, emails between October 27 and October 30 showed.Future’s Samani at first declined the request, stating in an e-mail that the order was “confidential in nature” and sharing further information could be “deterimental” to the company.

While Jio did not disclose the capital it has invested in Krikey, it said that the investee company has so far raised $22 million (Rs 165 crore).Krikey has also launched Yaatra, an action-adventure game, with Jio.

They would typically devise a formula and seek bids from users.They will continue to devise a pricing formula, but will now have to seek bids on the electronic-platform of five pre-selected agencies, the notification said.The agencies are SBI Capital Markets Ltd, mjunction Services Ltd, RITES, MSTC and CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solution Ltd.This follows the Union Cabinet in October allowing marketing freedom for blocks where pricing freedom already existed. Alongside, it approved standardised bidding for price discovery.The companies ""shall design the tender/ bid offer, including the eligibility criteria, bid parameters, evaluation criteria, tender fee, salient terms and conditions of Gas Sales Agreement and any other relevant information etc, with a view to encourage wider participation from prospective buyers, promote competition and maximise the value of natural gas offered,"" it said.ONGC and OIL are also to follow these guidelines for the discovery of the market price of natural gas produced from their fields wherever pricing and marketing freedom has been granted, the order said.""The existing gas sales agreements, made in connection with contract provisions, would continue till the duration of the agreements/contracts and thereafter subsequent sale of gas shall be subject to these guidelines,"" it added.Reliance and its partner BP have sold initial 5 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from their second wave of discoveries in the KG-D6 block for five years.ONGC too has sold initial gas from the neighbouring KG-D5 block.The two will use the new guidelines whenever the existing contracts expire or they have additional quantities of gas to offer.The order said the companies must ensure at least 21 days' time for bidding.They have to submit to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) details of the auction such as a list of participants, qualified bidders and selected bidders with their price and quantity allocated.""The entire proceeding will be conducted by the contractor/producer without any need for the approval of the government,"" the order said.

The conversation on Day 1 of the two-day Facebook-hosted event revolved around opportunities in India, the way digital can accelerate economic progress, and how small businesses will be a key part of the global recovery going forward.  Read the full transcript of the conversation between Mukesh Ambani and Mark Zuckerberg below:   Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I am sorry that we can't do this together in person, but we're excited to host the first-ever Facebook Fuel event in India. India is a very special and important country for us. Millions of people here use our products every day to stay in touch with friends and family. Whether it's a WhatsApp message, or a Facebook post, or photos on Instagram. And millions of small businesses across the country use WhatsApp business and Messenger to reach customers, manage orders, and grow their businesses. And in fact, we actually test some of our new features here first, before rolling them out globally. And speaking of tests, we just announced that we are hosting India’s tour of Australia on demand on Facebook Watch. I am not exactly a sports guy myself, but I understand that that's quite a big deal here. And what I do know is that India is home to a lot of incredibly talented people. Now we see that in the folks that we recruit in our offices, both in India and at our headquarters, back in California. But this is more than just about Facebook because what happens in India here is important for the whole world as well. Prime Minister Modi's Digital India Vision, has opened up opportunities for the industry to partner with the government to accelerate growth and development through technology. And India is building local capabilities and tech capacity, to power innovative new business models and provide Indian citizens access to digital and financial inclusion. So, decisions that are made here, shape the global discussion about how technology can drive more economic opportunity and better outcomes for people. And a lot of Indian organizations are leading the way, and using technology to build safer communities and more inclusive financial systems. Whether it's in social commerce, or education or financial services, there is a lot of innovation that happens here, and we are proud to partner with some of the teams that are working on these important challenges. There's a very entrepreneurial culture here, that's quite remarkable. It's a great example of how access to better tools can unlock more opportunity for people, and we see that not just in the tech start-up scene, but millions and millions of small businesses that recognize the value that all these tools can provide. So, at Facebook, we like to say that we are in the business of serving small businesses. And nowhere is this more true than in India. This is especially important because small businesses here will be a key part of the global recovery going forward. And we are focused on making sure we build the best tools for them. So, this is part of a much broader conversation about how we can all make sure that tech delivers for everyone. And that's one of the reasons why we wanted to partner with Jio, which has played such a key role in giving hundreds of millions of Indians access to the benefits of the internet, everything that it can provide, and fostering this entrepreneurial culture. And with that, I am really glad to welcome Mukesh Ambani, the Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries, to talk about where things stand in terms of the country's digital transformation, and what we should expect in the years ahead. Mukesh, thank you very much for being here and let's get started.  Mukesh Ambani: Mark, first of all, congratulations to you and your team for organizing this Facebook Fuel for India event. I am sure this event will provide a lot of fuel of ideas to fire India’s growth engine as you just described. The most powerful idea that can propel India’s growth is that young people can create great enterprises and new businesses. And all the young Indian people see an inspiring young icon in Mark Zuckerberg. They are motivated when they see how in just 14 years, Facebook has become the face of a digitally connected India. So, let me begin by conveying my best wishes to the success of your dreams for India, Indians, and small Indian businesses.  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you, I appreciate that. You know, so maybe today we should start with a topic that I know is top of mind for a lot of us, that is COVID-19 and the impact that it has had on all of our lives and communities. So, I am curious from your perspective, how is India doing right now? And when do you expect things are going to return to normal? And I know that Reliance has taken a number of big steps to help the community and help the country, and it's been a big year for you. So I am curious to hear, how did your company adapt to help move forward in the midst of this pandemic?  Mukesh Ambani: The sheer magnitude of COVID-19 pandemic, like everybody else in the world, did startle all of us in India. But then I think it is not in India’s DNA to be deterred by a crisis. I firmly believe that a crisis is too precious to be wasted. Every crisis presents an opportunity for new growth, and India has faced the COVID crisis with enormous resilience and resolve. Prime Minister Modi has led India from the front, and while we are not as rich a country as some of our western counterparts, being fiscally prudent, he has taken steps to take care of our vulnerable. We have given free food for right up to December of this year, to over 800 million Indians. 200 million citizens in India are getting direct cash transfer of Rs. 1500 in their bank account - that is the digitally connected India. And now we are ready and pretty much at par with the world, to roll out one of the largest vaccine programs in the first half of 2021, under Prime Minister's leadership. We at Reliance and Reliance Foundation, have also taken steps. As you know, Reliance has over 350,000 employees across the length and breadth of India and we have taken steps to protect over 2 million in our family and the community around them. In Mumbai, we have built a hospital just dedicated to COVID-19. We have Life Sciences as part of our business, so we have tested up early on - we have really ramped up testing, and we believe that testing helped in tracing and isolation, and at least reduced fatalities in our communities to a very low level. We have produced PPEs. We are in the textile business in Reliance, and India did not have…we used to import all our protective gear from the external world. In a matter of months, we at Reliance, produced a hundred thousand PPE's, and we are now exporters from India and this happened during the COVID time. And most importantly in the early days, when we were little stuck, we at the Reliance Foundation, distributed 55 million, one of the largest meal distribution programs for the vulnerable, in all the states and villages. So, we have played our part. And as far as Jio is concerned, we had our own dedicated team. And I could tell you that, we had never imagined that we would all work from home and the network traffic grew multiple percentage and none of us stepped out. But we could maintain 99% availability, so that Indians could work from home, shop from home, study from home, and remain connected to the rest of the world. You know, Mark, sometimes I wonder that if the pandemic had struck India just four or five years earlier, we would not have been in as good a shape as what we are today, with all the connectivity we have. The credit for that must go to our Prime Minister's Digital India vision, where he motivated the entire industry to roll out broadband in the first five years of his first term. And during the pandemic, India has attracted the largest foreign direct investment in its history. Mark, we have our own example of how Jio and Facebook concluded our partnership right in the middle of lockdown. And let me tell you with utmost sincerity, that we at Reliance and Jio, immensely value our partnership with Facebook. Thank you for your faith in Jio. Thank you, Mark, for your faith in India. I have no hesitation in going on record, that it is your investment that set the ball rolling. Not only for Jio but for the Indian FDI which has been the largest-ever in its history. And our partnership between Jio and Facebook will actually demonstrate that it is great for India, Indians, and small Indian businesses. And I believe Mark, that our actions will speak louder than our words in the coming months and years.  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you. So, you know, one of the big opportunities that I see with this Facebook and Jio partnership is the role that we can play together in supporting the millions of small businesses in India, especially now with the impact that COVID is having, in accelerating the move of businesses from physical storefronts to digital ones in this digital future. So, I am curious what role do you see technology playing in this post-COVID world, especially as it relates to all of these small businesses. I know you share a passion with me that it is just critical that we serve them.  Mukesh Ambani: Absolutely, Mark. And let me point out a very unique feature about our partnership. Perhaps not many people have understood this. Because, before this partnership I believe that each one of us was mainly a communication platform. Together, we now have become a value creation platform for our customers and small businesses. And I firmly believe that technology, all the digitisation steps that India has taken will democratise wealth and value creation for individuals and small businesses. And let me explain this very simply. WhatsApp has hundreds of millions of subscribers in India. Jio has hundreds of millions of subscribers in India. Jio Mart, which is our retail service, has the aspiration of serving tens of millions of small shopkeepers in India, who are the bedrock of employment. So what does this mean? This means Jio brings digital connectivity, WhatsApp now with WhatsApp Pay brings digital interactivity, and the ability to move to close transactions and create value and Jio Mart brings the unmatched online and offline retail opportunity, that gives our small shops which exist in villages and small towns in India, a chance to digitize and be at par with anybody else in the world. To my mind, more wealth creation means more employment and more business. And together with our platforms and the tools that we will provide to small businesses and to individual consumers, I believe will drive India to a 5 trillion economy and will make a much more equal India, with more equal wealth growth at the bottom of the pyramid. You know, Mark, I firmly believe that in the next two decades, India will grow to be among the top three economies in the world. But more importantly, it will become a premier digital society. It will be a modern society with young people driving it, with young businesses driving it. And our per capita income will go from eighteen hundred - two thousand dollars per capita, to five thousand dollars per capita. Our mid-income or the middle class in India which is about 50% of its total number of households, will grow to three to four percent per year. And I think that Facebook, Jio, and a lot of other companies and entrepreneurs in the world, have a golden opportunity to be in India, to be part of this economic and social transformation, that we are witnessing and that will accelerate in the coming decades.  Mark Zuckerberg: I completely agree, and your company has already done so much to help fuel this. Reliance brought about the 4G revolution in India, and I know that 5G now is another big focus for you. But what your company has done here I think, has been truly remarkable in helping to bring hundreds of millions of people onto the internet and bringing opportunity. And I’m curious, as you look ahead to the future in India, what other technologies or developments are you excited about now? And where do you see the country in the next five to ten years?  Mukesh Ambani: Well, as I mentioned to you Mark, I really see India accelerating as a premier digital society. I see us integrating both 5G…and just yesterday, our Prime Minister has said that, he wants every village and every gram panchayat…India has 680,000 villages, and we have a population of 1.3 billion people, and he wants everybody to be empowered on the information highway with high speed fix broadband, and which is happening. We also think that compute and very low latency compute is real. I think that there is a great opportunity for really bringing education and health care. With the second-generation reforms that were done in the last six months, we have unique opportunities and as Jio we are connecting all the 1.9 million schools in India and the 58 000 colleges. At any point in time, we will have in the coming decades, about 200 million children or young adults, between the age of 3 and 18 in our education system. I think that in a span of 10 years, we can set for ourselves an objective really to reskill India and the talent that you talked about, can improve 10x. Today, you're just seeing the creamy layer, but that's what technology can do to really make a better India and a better world. The same thing we can do in health and all the emerging technology and integrations, where we can make sure that we deliver services, and we deliver good proactive health. We've learned that and I think we're going to use technology. We are working very closely with all the authorities to make sure that we provide the technology tools and backbone for even vaccination in the coming quarters using technology. So, I think health, education….we've already… and I think that what India has done is in a sense, we have democratized value creation with the drive of our Prime Minister. And you can see it in payments, you will see it in terms of making sure that technology is easily available and we made it affordable, so that millions of millions of people, even at this lower per capita basis can use this in a large market. And with that finally, I really see the enterprise and the enthusiasm of young Indians, their aspirations, and their confidence that is really driving India. And that is why I think that the next two decades are going to be historic in terms of the social and economic transformation.  Mark Zuckerberg: That makes sense. You, of course, already talked about commerce and driving small businesses and entrepreneurship. It always blows me away that India has more than 60 million small businesses, and millions of people around the country rely on them for jobs and that's a big part of what I hope that our partnership can serve here. We support more than 50 million WhatsApp business app users globally every month already. And more than 15 million of these are in India. So you know with communities around the world now in lockdown there are a lot of these entrepreneurs who need digital tools that they can rely on to find and communicate with customers and grow their businesses. And now this is just something that I think that our partnership can really help with. And of course, beyond the impact on small businesses.I just think that this year has reminded us of how essential technology can be as a tool for people, to just connect with each other. Whether it's using the networks that your companies have established, or the tools that we've built to be able to have that human connection, and find important information. And as you said, I can't imagine going through the pandemic 10 years ago, two decades, when the internet was still nascent. It should have been a completely different experience. And technology, of course, is allowing us to make sure we can get accurate information out to people that has implications in health, like you're talking about, in education and helping serve people better. And I think it shows a lot of the promise for what's ahead and I think we've certainly fared better now, than we would have if the pandemic had hit us before.  Mukesh Ambani: I couldn't agree more, Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg: You know, going back to Reliance, one of the great business stories in history, your father founded Reliance Industries and he has this incredible legacy here in India. And now I’ve read that, he once held up a postcard in his office and said, if every Indian could speak with each other at the cost of this postcard, where will India be? And now your father clearly had a vision for where things were heading in the country, and because today Indians can communicate with one another for less than the cost of a postcard, and that's what we've tried to do with messaging…and hopefully we can do that together with payments and make it so people can use India's new UPI system, which I think is just great. It's a tremendous public good that the government has put out there. But I am curious, before we get into UPI and more on that, what's the most important thing that you learned from your father and his legacy, that has helped you build these amazing businesses and get to where they are today?  Mukesh Ambani: So Mark, thank you for those kind words on my father. Just so that when he motivated us in 2000, in terms of saying, can you make voice at the cost of a postcard? In 2020, we're very proud that Jio has pioneered free voice. So, all the 400 million people are a tribute to his vision. They are on our network and have a free voice. And as you said, my father was a son of a school teacher. He came to Mumbai with just a thousand rupees in 1960 and established Reliance with a belief that I will invest in businesses of the future, and I will invest in talent. And, for all the young people at Reliance and across India, I repeat my learnings in terms of building Reliance, three basic tenets really. One is, for entrepreneurs, it's important to have courage and self-belief. There can be no better person to demonstrate that in the last couple of decades than you, Mark. So you know, all of us believe that we have to believe in ourselves. And all of us know as entrepreneurs that we don't succeed at the first attempt, and self-belief comes to you when you fail. And self-belief increases your confidence when you succeed. So, courage and self-belief is something that I always tell entrepreneurs, remember that it's important. The second piece that he started and he's instilled into all of us is that, while you succeed, it's important to always have empathy and creativity in everything that you do. And by empathy, I mean, put yourself in the other's shoe, and make sure that how you make them feel is how you would want to feel. At Reliance, we do that at many levels now - we care for our employees, our investors, society, environment, and above all national interests of India. You know, within creativity….and I always give this example in terms of saying that, when Reliance needed to grow, capital markets were not there. It was the 1980s, and my father came up by saying, I will actually share shares of Reliance, which was never done in the private sector. In the 80s, the first AGM of Reliance was in a football ground, and we had 60,000 shareholders. You and I both do annual general meetings. And his AGM in the 1980s for Reliance was in a football ground and he said, my purpose is really to win investor’s confidence. Since then, creativity and empathy are critical as you go along. And the final thing that I have learned from my father, is really the importance of relationship, trust, and loyalty. The whole of Reliance right now, with hundreds of thousands of people, is one big family. We're not related by birth, but we are really woven together by passion, purpose, and conviction. We have faith in one another. We are loyal to one another, to this large Reliance family. For us, it's always one for all, and all for one. And I hope that a lot of people around the world can relate to this. That's what we believe at Reliance and for all of us at Reliance, he will still be the founder, if we follow his vision in terms of investing in businesses of the future. Mark, now that brings me to questions for you. Mark, what made you believe in India and the Jio story? As I said, you started this FDI avalanche in India, and the world recognized when Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, in the middle of lockdown said, I am going to bet on India and I’m going to make even in this uncertain times, one of the largest foreign direct investments in India. What do you think of the digital network that you are clearly….I call you the architect of the digital network of the world. While I have built some connectivity and broadband connectivity in India, you've done that for the world. Please share with us your experience as the digital architect of the world, how your global Facebook has helped people in this crisis, and your perspective of the crisis, and where you see the world today, and where it is going after you just explain to us what you’ve done in India?  Mark Zuckerberg: Your words are incredibly generous. And we started this to help give people a tool to stay connected with their friends, and then expand to friends and family and communities, and a lot of this just ends up being a universal human phenomenon. No matter what country you're in, you know everyone cares about their friends and family, and their communities, and wants to stay connected. And what we've seen is that, India is actually home to the largest communities in the world, across Facebook and WhatsApp and getting there on Instagram, as well. So, we see the vitality and the entrepreneurship, and the creativity of businesses, and how much people want to connect, and you see a tremendous number of people coming online, a lot of that…thanks to your investments, and the work that you've done to enable hundreds of millions of people to come online here. And I just see a very promising future in India. We talked briefly about how there's a big trend of financial inclusion ahead, and how the ease of payments is going to be such a big deal for commerce, and giving people self-reliance and control of their own destiny, and a lot of that. We just launched WhatsApp payments in India last month - now you can send money to your friends and family through WhatsApp, as easily as sending a message. That was possible because of the UPI system that has been built in India. Unified Payments Interface, makes it easy for anyone to instantly accept payments across different apps. I think we're working with 140 banks or it's supported by 140 banks. India is the first country in the world to do anything like this. So, we're grateful to be able to support this kind of innovation and to help to work, to create more prosperity, and help achieve a more Digital India. And frankly, I think that a lot of other places around the world are going to be better off when they follow some of this lead that India has set, in creating public goods like this. So there's really a tremendous amount to be inspired by, with what is going on in India now. And we're just grateful to be able to serve our community here, and help people stay connected with the people they care about but also, create economic opportunity as well.  Mukesh Ambani: Thanks Mark, as you said, we are looking forward to your involvement and innovation in India, creating benefit for hundreds of millions of people and then taking this innovation to the rest of the world. I hope that the rest of the world learns from Indian policy, and what Facebook is able to achieve in India. And we as Indians will be very proud, if Facebook says we did it first in India, and then took it to 100 countries. And I look forward to working with you on that. Mark, all of us would love to know your views on how the world is changing, and what you and Facebook are thinking about it, and what you see the future as. Just give us your perspective, Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg: I think that there are a number of very important trends, but maybe I'll just talk about two. So, one is that, I think technology is giving individuals’ power and opportunities that were previously only held by large organizations. So, we've spent a lot of time today talking about small businesses, but one of the things that I think is so powerful about the internet is it makes it so that individual entrepreneurs and small businesses can now have access to the same kind of tools for reaching new customers and doing sophisticated analytics and communication that previously only bigger companies would have been able to build up the capacity to do that. And individuals can now share their ideas online, and get access to information in ways that previously only wealthier people or larger organizations would have had the capacity to share their ideas, or get access to information at that kind of scale. And overall, I think that just makes people's lives better. It's incredibly empowering and it's incredibly democratizing. India being the world's largest democracy, I think it really makes sense to lead there, because just empowering individuals, which I know is something that you believe deeply in as well, is just going to be a huge part of what will hopefully create a lot of prosperity, as you mentioned in the decades ahead. The other thing that I’m excited about is more of a technological vision for the future. There are a lot of interesting technologies, but one trend that I focus a lot on is that as people we're always looking to connect with other people and share our experiences in the richest way that we can. So, if you look back to the beginning of the internet, most of the internet was text. We would text each other, chat, share our experiences but then connections got better. And then we got to photos being the primary way that we shared. And you know the old saying, a picture is worth a thousand words. Now, a lot of sharing is through photos and we're now on the next step with 4G and coming 5G networks - video is really becoming the primary way that people share. Anyone can largely capture something on their phones and can share it or stream it, and increasingly, people are able to consume that. And video is just a lot richer of a medium than photos even can be. When my daughters took her first steps, I wanted to capture a video of that and share it, not just a photo. But I don't think video is the end of the line. So, a lot of what I am focused on is helping to create virtual reality and augmented reality. So that way we can share not only a video of an experience, but you can use virtual reality to go into an experience and feel like you're right there. You can have holograms of digital objects that can kind of be as realistic as the physical objects that are there. Maybe you know, in five or ten years, when we're having this conversation, just a hologram version of me will be sitting on the couch next to you, instead of having to do this over a screen. And it'll feel a lot more realistic. So, I just think that's going to be incredibly powerful. And the power of virtual and augmented reality is they deliver the sense of a presence. You feel like you're right there with another person, which really will be the ultimate in human connection, and it will give people the opportunity to work and to connect, no matter where they want to be. So that's something that we're very focused on and invested in. And I’m just very excited for the future. And on that note, let me just wrap up and just say again how grateful I am for everything that you and your companies do, and for the partnership. I do think that in so many ways, not just Jio and the technology platforms, but the other businesses that you've built, you've had such a positive impact on improving the quality of lives for hundreds of millions of Indians. A big part of why I was excited to partner with you is, there are not many people around the world who've just gone industry after industry and revolutionized them and improved them, and continue to do it, and have that hunger to improve the lives of so many people. So, I just have a deep admiration for that. And I am really looking forward to working together over the coming years and decades to make sure we can serve the people in India as well as possible. And hopefully, a lot of those advances will be expanded outside of India as well, to help people around the world. But I am incredibly grateful for your partnership on this. Thank you for joining me for this inaugural Facebook Fuel event today.  Mukesh Ambani: Thank you very much, Mark. And thank you for sharing your awesome vision of the future. You started this with saying that on Facebook, you would see the India - Australia cricket match, I look forward to a day when Facebook will take me with everything that you explained on virtual reality, where I will be sitting in Mumbai and be in a stadium in Australia. And I’m sure that day, with your digital architecture and leadership, is not far away. Thank you so very much for having me.

Thank you Mark for your faith in India,” Ambani said at a virtual event.After Facebook’s investment, Jio Platforms raised $20 billion from various investors, including US-based tech investor Silver Lake Partners and search engine major Google.Zuckerberg, whose WhatsApp Pay was finally given the nod to roll out payments last month after waiting for over two years in beta mode, said he would aim to imitate the success of Ambani’s father Dhirubhai Ambani’s idea for their payments business — to make it as cheap and widely available.""... your father clearly had a vision for where things were heading in the country, and because today Indians can communicate with one another for less than the cost of a postcard, and that's what we've tried to do with messaging…and hopefully we can do that together with payments and make it so people can use India's new UPI (Unified Payments Interface) system, which I think is just great. It's a tremendous public good that the government has put out there,” Zuckerberg said.He has previously said he wants to take WhatsApp Pay to other global markets. Currently, WhatsApp Pay is gradually being rolled out to 20 million Indian users.Zuckerberg also had words of praise for the Indian engineering talent that his company has employed, even as he complimented the digital programmes initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Prime Minister Modi's Digital India Vision, has opened up opportunities for the industry to partner with the government to accelerate growth and development through technology… decisions that are made here, shape the global discussion about how technology can drive more economic opportunity and better outcomes for people.”He also touched upon the plans of 5G in the Indian telecom sector and said that it will enable further immersive experiences through virtual and augmented reality, and hologram technology.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/you-started-fdi-avalanche-in-india-ambani-to-zuckerberg/articleshow/79750176.cms,2

Located at a water depth of more than 2,000 metres, R Cluster is also the deepest offshore gas field in Asia and the first ultra-deepwater project to come on stream in India, the companies said in a joint statement.The D1 and D3 fields in the KG-D6 block, touted as the world’s biggest gas find of the time, ceased production in February after being in operation for a decade during which it pumped about 3 trillion cubic feet of gas – way below the initial projection.The start of production from R Cluster will boost the government’s efforts to expand the share of natural gas in the country’s energy basket from 6% to 15% in the next three years as part of plans to reduce the economy’s carbon footprint. But it also coincides with record low gas prices in India because of the government’s pricing formula benchmarked to surplus markets.The formula allows a price ceiling of $4.06 per unit for gas produced from ultra-deepwater fields such as R Cluster against $1.79 for supplies from non-challenging fields.Production from R Cluster is expected to reach a plateau of about 12.9 mmscmd (million standard cubic meters per day) in 2021. Satellites Cluster will be the next project that will be brought on stream in 2021 followed by the MJ project in 2022.The three projects together are expected to meet about 15% of India’s gas demand by 2023 and will utilise the existing infrastructure in KG D6 block, the companies said in a joint statement.Peak gas production from the three fields is expected to be around 30 mmscmd by 2023 which is expected to be about 25% of India’s domestic production and will help reduce the country’s dependence on imported gas.Reliance is the operator of KG-D6 block with 66.67% interest, while BP holds 33.33%. ""This is a significant milestone in India's energy landscape, for a cleaner and greener gas-based economy. Through our deep-water infrastructure in the Krishna Godavari basin we expect to produce gas and meet the growing clean energy requirements of the nation,” the statement quoted Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani as saying.“This start-up is another example of the possibility of our partnership with Reliance, bringing the best of both companies to help meet India’s rapidly expanding energy needs.

The protesters fear that effluents from the plant may adversely affect their catch. 79791686According to analysts, the main ingredient of the company’s success is its positioning as the one of the key global suppliers of APIs like Naproxen (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), Detromethorphan (cough suppressant) and Gabapentin (anti-convulsant), a position it attained by edging out some global pharma giants, and sharp focus on CRAMS.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/divis-labs-enters-1l-cr-mcap-club/articleshow/79788501.cms,1

Besides, Ajanta Pharma, Alembic Pharma, Astral Poly Tech, AU Small Finance and Bajaj Finance are among the 'potential 25 wealth creators for the next 25 years', said the brokerage firm.    The brokerage firm on December 22 announced the Motilal Oswal 25th Annual Wealth Creation Study, 2020.  For the last 25 years, the firm has been releasing a wealth creation study every year. Raamdeo Agrawal, Chairman of Motilal Oswal Group, commissions the study every year.  In this year's study, the brokerage firm attempted to shortlist 25 stocks likely to deliver handsome returns over the next 25 years.  As per the brokerage firm, it made a list of 150 mid-cap companies i.e. companies that are ranked 101 to 250 by current market cap.  It preferred consumer-facing, secular business models and eliminated cyclical businesses like auto ancillaries, capital goods, chemicals, oil &amp;amp; gas and realty which reduced the list of companies from 150 to 114.  To ensure the chosen firms are very profitable, the brokerage firm said it picked companies with last 5-year average RoE greater than 15 percent. This reduced the list from 114 to 63.  Next, it judged the business potential and management potential of the companies, and selected only those which qualified on both counts. This reduced the list from 63 to 28.  After that, the brokerage firm flagged off market leaders from the 28 companies to arrive at a list of 13 companies. Apart from these 13 companies, the brokerage chose 5 such companies from the list of 28 that are beneficiaries of value migration. In situations of value migration, all companies benefit irrespective of market leadership.  Now, the total shortlisted stocks were 18.  The brokerage firm said it chose only large-caps for financials and picked 6 leader names for the portfolio, now taking the total to 24.  At last, it opted for a pure digital play, even if it didn’t meet some of the above filters, taking the total to 25.  &quot;We believe in the very long run, valuations matter less.

But, 2020 has been a year full of events outside the realm of imagination.The year started off on an ominous note for financial markets when on January 3 top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike in Iraq, ratcheting up tensions in the Middle East.The sensex tumbled more than 900 points over two sessions but resumed its upward march to hit life highs later that month.Equities largely shrugged off initial reports of a coronavirus outbreak in China, in tandem with the global bourses, and looked ahead to the Budget.However, the Sensex logged one of its biggest single-day declines on February 1 after the Union Budget failed to live up to market expectations of growth-boosting measures and fiscal discipline.The real test, alas, was ahead.From mid-February, world stocks started getting skittish as it became clear that the Covid-19 crisis would not be limited to China.To add to the woes, Yes Bank was placed under a moratorium in a rare move, triggering a crisis of confidence in the domestic banking sector.The explosive cocktail of a global market meltdown and domestic troubles proved too much to take for Dalal Street. Four of the biggest single-day declines in the history of BSE sensex came in March 2020, leaving participants shell-shocked.Its biggest-ever plunge (in absolute terms) was on March 23, when the benchmark crashed 3,934.72 points or 13.15 per cent.Astonishingly, March also saw some of the index's biggest up-moves amid the RBI stepping in with emergency liquidity support.The Sensex's largest-ever single-session gain came a little later on April 7, when it zoomed 2,476.26 points as investors wagered on more stimulus measures from the government to battle the economic fallout of the pandemic.The turbulence on the domestic bourses also mirrored global market turmoil. The Dow Jones suffered its worst fall, emerging market assets were routed and in a mind-boggling moment, US oil futures turned negative for the first time in history.For a while, the world stopped making any sense.With the world economy comatose and governments overwhelmed by a cataclysmic health crisis, the task of propping up the financial markets and restoring investor confidence fell to the global central banks.""2020 will probably go down in history as a year when global central bankers injected close to $11 trillion as stimuli to combat the COVID pandemic,” said S Ranganathan, head of research at LKP Securities.The massive money printing by the US Federal Reserve and its peers sparked a breathtaking turnaround in global stock markets.Never bet against the Fed, as the saying goes.Flush with funds, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) poured in billions of dollars into emerging markets, with India topping the chart in Asia.FPI net inflows into Indian equity markets have crossed Rs 1.5 lakh crore (over $20 billion) this year -- a lifetime peak.The sensex erased its 2020 losses on November 5, while global investors monitored the results of the tightly-contested US elections.The next booster dose for world markets came over the following few days as companies like Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca began announcing positive results from their Covid-19 vaccine trials.Human innovation once again triumphed against all odds, setting off a record-shattering relief rally in equities. From November 9 to December 18, the sensex hit fresh record highs in 22 out of the 29 sessions.For the calendar year (till December 24), the sensex has gained 13.86 per cent, while the Nifty has delivered returns of 12.99 per cent.Compared to the March lows, both the indices are up by a hefty 80 per cent.Benchmarks had another engine propelling them higher this year – Reliance Industries (RIL), which became the first Indian company to reach a market capitalisation of Rs 15 lakh crore ($200 billion) in September.Beginning April, the Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate announced a slew of deals to sell minority stakes in its telecom and retail arms to marquee investors like Facebook, Google, Silver Lake, KKR, Mubadala, and Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia.The company has raised around $25 billion so far this year as it seeks to ramp up its consumer-facing businesses.For a good part of the year, RIL almost single-handedly drove the domestic benchmarks higher in the absence of any buying triggers.The Covid-19 crisis also forced investors to take a relook at their sectoral allocations.""From the lows, markets started stabilising and pandemic sectors like FMCG, IT, pharma and chemicals benefitted. As the economy further opened up, growth and cyclical sectors reversed positively,"" said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.However, while stocks seem to have found their animal spirits back, there are also some murmurs of discontent.Analysts say world stock markets have developed a dangerous addiction to endless money printing by central banks, and show withdrawal symptoms of a junkie at the slightest indication of a moderation in monetary stimulus.Back home too, around half of the government's Rs 20.97 lakh crore economic stimulus package comprised RBI's liquidity measures.This glut of global liquidity has pushed markets so far ahead of economic fundamentals that some are beginning to question whether the real economy matters in equity investing at all.For example, no one would be able to tell looking at the sensex chart that the Indian economy shrank 23.9 per cent in the first three months of FY21, and 7.5 per cent the next quarter.Globally too, markets have been on a manic upswing even as millions have lost their jobs, small businesses are battling for survival and entire industries have been decimated.While the real economy has been ravaged by the pandemic, most financial market indicators are ruling at stratospheric levels.The BSE Sensex is currently trading at a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 32.89, the highest on record.To put it differently, investors are paying Rs 32.89 for every rupee of future earnings of the 30 Sensex firms, compared to the previous 20-year average of around Rs 19.Global market capitalisation -- the value of all the listed stocks in the world – topped $100 trillion for the first time ever in December.And in a classic sign of market mania, there's a rush of first-time investors eager to make a quick buck.A record 68 lakh new dematerialised (or demat) accounts were opened in India between April and October 2020, compared to nearly 49 lakh in the entire FY20, which was the highest in a decade.Experts attribute this trend to factors like increased time at home due to the lockdown, efforts to make up for lost jobs or incomes, and also FOMO, or the fear of missing out on this rally.This is also reflected in the growing popularity of discount broking apps like Zerodha and Upstox, which have dislodged traditional broking houses in terms of active clients.Like the Robinhood app in the US, such platforms have attracted the tech-savvy crowd with their slick interface and mobile-first approach which has 'gamified' the once-stodgy field of stock market investing.With Fed and FOMO playing in tandem, many questioned technicalities like PE and PB ratios. But, some analysts also maintain that 2020 was an outlier in terms of corporate earnings and hence valuation metrics like PE ratios this year are not strictly comparable to historical averages.However, even they agree that every segment of the economy would have to stage a synchronous and sensational comeback to catch up with the market projections.And if that comes to pass, 2021 would be an even more incredible year for the bourses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/virus-vaccines-and-volatility-stock-market-takes-a-wild-ride-in-2020/articleshow/79986727.cms,1

As a consequence of illegal actions of vested interests and miscreants, the petitioner's infrastructure across Punjab has been severely damaged, causing losses to the tune of hundreds of crore.The company also sought constitution of a competent authority under the Punjab Prevention of Damage to Public and Private Property Act for the assessment of losses caused to it.It has stated that it had given a representation to the Punjab chief minister last month, seeking urgent intervention in the matter.In the petition, the company submitted that the petitioner, its parent company and its affiliates had no plans to enter corporate or contract farming.In a statement, Reliance said it ""has nothing whatsoever to do with the three farm laws currently debated in the country, and in no way benefits from them”.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-jio-moves-hc-against-damage-to-infra-forcible-closure-of-stores/articleshow/80097407.cms,1

They have stayed put despite heavy rains and waterlogging at protest sites over the last couple of days, besides severe cold weather conditions prevailing in and around the national capital.Kavitha Kurungati of Mahila Kisan Adhikar Manch, said, ""The standoff continued as the government is talking about benefits of the laws and we are asking for the repeal of those laws.""""The government said they will consult further and get back to us,"" she said.Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) President Balbir Singh Rajewal said farmers will not agree to anything less than the repeal of three farms laws.""We will discuss only the MSP issue and the repeal of laws. It is the ego problem of the government that is coming in way of resolving issues,"" he said.Talking to reporters after the meeting, Tomar said the farmer leaders should flag specific issues in the three laws on which they have problems. He maintained that the talks took place in a cordial atmosphere.Asked whether the deadlock was due to a trust deficit between the government and the farmers, Tomar said the unions would not have agreed to continue the talks if they did not have the trust.On whether the next meeting would also result in deciding another date, Tomar said everyone was free to think the way one wants, but the simple fact that talks are continuing indicates that there is a willingness to find a solution and he remains hopeful of that.To a question about parallel talks with other farmer groups that are supporting the laws, the minister said the government is committed to the interests of all farmers of the country.Enacted in September 2020, the government has presented these laws as major farm reforms and aimed at increasing farmers' income.During the meeting, the government listed various benefits from the three laws, enacted a few months ago, but farmers kept insisting that the legislation must be withdrawn to address their apprehensions that the new Acts would weaken the MSP and mandi systems and leave them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has maintained that these apprehensions are misplaced and has ruled out repealing the laws.Besides Tomar, Railways, Commerce and Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is an MP from Punjab, are also part of the ministerial group holding talks with the representatives of 41 farmer unions.The meeting at Vigyan Bhawan in the heart of the national capital began with tributes to the farmers who have lost their lives during the ongoing protest.A government statement said the ministers also expressed grief over the death of the farmers.They also extended new year greetings to the union leaders at the start of the meeting.On December 30, the sixth round of talks was held between the government and the farmer unions, where some common ground was reached on two demands -- decriminalisation of stubble-burning and continuation of power subsidies.However, no breakthrough could be reached on the two main demands of the protesting farmers -- a repeal of the three recent farm laws and a legal guarantee to the MSP procurement system.On Sunday, Tomar met Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and discussed the government strategy to resolve the current crisis at the earliest, sources said.Tomar discussed with Singh all possible options to find a ""middle path"" to resolve the crisis, they added.While several opposition parties and people from other walks of life have come out in support of the farmers, some farmer groups have also met the agriculture minister over the last few weeks to extend their support to the three laws.Last month, the government had sent a draft proposal to the protesting farmer unions, suggesting seven-eight amendments to the new laws and a written assurance on the MSP procurement system. The government has ruled out a repeal of the three agri laws.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), in the meantime, issued a press statement condemning the police action against protesting farmers in Punjab and Haryana and a ban on protests and dharnas imposed by the Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh government.It also said that an affidavit filed by Reliance Industries in the Punjab and Haryana High Court was ""a ploy to save its business"".

Taking advantage of the ongoing farmers' agitation near the national capital, these vested interests have launched an incessant, malicious and motivated vilification campaign against Reliance, which has absolutely no basis in truth, it said.The falsehood of the campaign becomes crystal clear from the following irrefutable facts, which we have placed before the Honourable high court. These facts establish that Reliance has nothing whatsoever to do with the three farm laws currently debated in the country, and in no way benefits from them. As such, the sole nefarious purpose of linking the name of Reliance to these laws is to harm our businesses and damage our reputation, said RIL.""Reliance Retail Limited (RRL), Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (RJIL), or any other affiliate of our parent company, i.e., Reliance Industries Limited have not done any 'corporate' or 'contract' farming in the past, and have absolutely no plans to enter this business,"" RIL said in its statement.Neither Reliance nor any of our subsidiaries has purchased any agricultural land, directly or indirectly, in Punjab/Haryana or anywhere else in India, for the purpose of ""corporate"" or ""contract"" farming.

It retails products of all categories including food grains and staples, fruits and vegetables, items of daily use, apparels, medicines, electronic products of various brands belonging to independent manufacturers and suppliers in the country. It does not purchase any food grains directly from farmers, according to RIL.It has never entered into long-term procurement contracts to gain unfair advantage over farmers or sought that its suppliers buy from farmers at less than remunerative prices, nor will it ever do so.""We at Reliance have immense gratitude and the greatest respect for India's kisans, who are the 'ANNA DATA' of 1.3 billion Indians.

The BJP brands some of the protesters as separatists from the giant multi-ethnic nation, a charge the demonstrators call disinformation.Bhavjit Singh became energised for the battle in November from his bedroom in Ludhiana in the agricultural heartland state of Punjab, where he watched with dismay the online attacks on the farmers.With a few friends, the information technology professional launched the @Tractor2twitr Twitter account in late November. The following month he journeyed to the focal protest site on a main highway connecting Haryana state and Delhi, the territory that includes the capital.Thousands there have jammed the road for kilometres with tractors, trailers and tents, sleeping in makeshift hovels and cooking in ramshackle kitchens.Singh, 38, joined the protesters with two smartphones.""We will intensify our campaign because we are getting organised and getting more support now,"" Singh told Reuters, speaking near the noisy protest site where open kitchens dished out midmorning snacks. ""Our war of perception, the war of messaging is going in the right direction.""The account, with more than 23,000 followers, promotes its message by pushing one hashtag a day. One day recently, #FarmersDyingModiEnjoying, pushed by @Tractor2twitr, was among the top hashtags on Indian Twitter - battling #ModiWithFarmers.Thirteen thousand kilometres (8,000 miles) away in Houston, Texas, Baljinder Singh is part of the core group that helps run the account.The BJP ""were targeting us, so we felt we had to answer them back,"" the owner of a couple of 7-Eleven stores in the United States told Reuters. ""We are all the sons and daughters of farmers.""Baljinder and Bhavjit Singh, who share a common Sikh family name, are not related.@Tractor2twitr has been joined in recent weeks by a union group called the Farmers Unity Front (Kisan Ekta Morcha), setting up accounts on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp and Snapchat, staffed by 50 volunteers, that have surged to hundreds of thousands of followers.'MANIPULATED MEDIA'The farmers demand Modi repeal the three farm laws, enacted in September, which they say could make them vulnerable to retail giants like Walmart Inc and India's Reliance Industries.The government says the laws, which let growers bypass government-regulated wholesale markets and sell directly to buyers, are a reform that gives farmers more options. It has sought to assure the farmers that the guaranteed-pricing system will not be dismantled.As the farmers were trooping toward Delhi late in 2020, a wave of misinformation began spreading online, said Rajneil Kamath, publisher of a fact-checking website.Old, unrelated images and videos - including some from demonstrations outside India calling for an independent Sikh homeland - were passed off as representing the farmers, Kamath said.In December, Twitter flagged a tweet by the head of the BJP's vast social media team, Amit Malviya, as ""manipulated media,"" saying a video he posted showing an elderly protestor narrowly avoiding a police beating had been misleadingly edited.BJP spokesman Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga says the party has been legitimately highlighting that people other than farmers, including Sikh separatists, had potentially infiltrated the protests.""We believe some people are trying to hijack the movement,"" Bagga said.At the protest site, Ammy Gill, a 25-year-old lyricist from Punjab, divides his time helping out at community kitchens and chronicling the protests on social media.""The objective of our social media messages is to counter the trolls and the campaign against farmers,"" Gill said.""We are not here for a picnic.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tractors-to-twitter-protesting-farmers-battle-on-highway-online/articleshow/80092065.cms,1

It has also argued that its subscribers are being forced to port to other networks by the miscreants and vested interests.According to the petitioner company, the attack by miscreants on their around 1,500 towers and some employees engaged in telecom work has affected their 1.4 crore customers in the state.The plea, which is expected to come up for hearing on Tuesday, said, “The petitioner and its affiliates share the aspiration of Indian farmers to get a fair and profitable price for what they produce with exemplary hard work and dedication and seek an augmentation of their incomes, and pledge to work towards this goal... Indeed, the petitioner, its parent entity, and its affiliates shall insist that their suppliers strictly abide by the minimum support price (MSP) mechanism, and or any other mechanism for remunerative price for farm produce, as may be determined and implemented by the government."" The company has sought directions to the Centre as well Punjab to identify the vested interests and miscreants and probe their well-orchestrated and sustained disinformation campaign being carried out against the petitioner company and take action including providing prosecution.According to the company, on account of the sustained disinformation campaign run by the vested interests, including through social media channels, the petitioner’s business and its assets have become a target of attack and destruction by miscreants purporting to be engaged in public demonstrations and protests against the farm legislations, the company has stated in its plea.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/reliance-moves-hc-no-contract-farming-plans/articleshow/80105642.cms,1

In the process, the index also recouped most of the over 1,200-point loss that it had witnessed since touching an all-time intraday high at 49,795 points on January 13. The day’s gains added about Rs 3.5 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 195.9 lakh crore.On the NSE, the Nifty closed 240 points, also 1.7%, higher at 14,521. According to LKP Securities head (research) S Ranganathan, the markets began on a positive note on support from global cues with Janet Yellen, the incoming US treasury secretary, calling for a much larger stimulus to bolster that country’s response to the pandemic. The gains in the afternoon trade were supported by hopes of positive foreign flows next month due to change in MSCI indices.“FPI (foreign portfolio investor) inflows of Rs 17,500 crore this month and hopes of strategic divestment have pushed bears on the back foot,” Ranganathan wrote in a note. A section of market players here are also concerned about the implications of Yellen’s statement on Tuesday that the US tax cut of 2017, which favoured the wealthy, should be reversed. Tuesday’s strong gains, however, came despite muted foreign fund net buying, while domestic funds were net sellers. End-of-the-day data on the BSE showed that while FPIs were net buyers at Rs 258 crore, domestic institutions were net sellers at Rs 199 crore. Additionally, the gains came despite the rising number of infections in several parts of Europe and concerns about the economic condition in those regions.Dealers feel muted foreign fund flows may not be good news for the Indian market, more so after the over $23-billion net inflows that the Indian market witnessed between October and December last year. Compared to an average daily net inflow of about Rs 2,800 crore during November and December, in January it has come down to about Rs 1,250 crore, according to CDSL data.In Tuesday’s session, HDFC, Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank contributed the most to the sensex’s gains.

The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in October granted an interim relief to Amazon by asking Future to put on hold its merger with Reliance.Amazon's petition in the court, reviewed by TOI, said Biyani-led Future Group 'deliberately and maliciously' disobeyed the international arbitration ruling from SIAC. The filing showed it also sought detention of Biyani in a ‘civil prison’ and attaching his assets to the case. In its bid to block the completion of Reliance-Future deal, the petition has sought an injunction from the court to direct Future Group from taking any steps to complete the disputed transaction with any entities that are part of the Reliance Group. This includes any 'direct or indirect transfer’ of Future Group assets to Reliance, according to Amazon’s plea to the court. Future Retail, in a filing to the BSE on Monday evening, said Amazon’s lawyers have informed the company of the case and it will defend the case. An Amazon India spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.Amazon’s latest move underscores the importance of the Indian market where it is fighting a bigger battle with Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, who is scaling up the new commerce venture with JioMart. The global e-commerce major has also sought directions from the court to restrict Future Group from relying on any regulatory or local agency approval to go ahead with the merger. Last week, market regulator Sebi gave a conditional nod to the Reliance-Future deal while antitrust regulator Competition Commission of India (CCI) gave its approval in November. Prior to this, Future in its case against Amazon had asked the court to restrict the latter from ‘interfering’ in the deal completion process by writing to the regulators. The court did not grant this to Future among its other observations. Separately, Amazon has filed an application to review this ruling from the court as well.

We can switch on to 5G as soon as we get government approvals,” Gopal Vittal, MD & CEO of Airtel, said as he unveiled the services at Hyderabad.“Every one of our investments is future-proofed as this test in Hyderabad proves… we have been the first in India to pioneer new technologies in our quest for empowering Indians everywhere.”Recently, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani had said that Jio wants to launch 5G in India and would look at developing indigenous technology.

This will make the oil 'carbon-neutral'.The Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) Sea Pearl containing the carbon-neutral oil unloaded the cargo at Jamnagar on January 28.""This transaction is a first step in the creation of a new market for climate-differentiated crude oil,"" the statement said.It is also a bridge to the development of a further differentiated petroleum product, net-zero oil, which Occidental intends to eventually produce through the capture and sequestration of atmospheric CO2 via industrial-scale direct air capture (DAC) facilities and geological sequestration.Ambani had in July last year unveiled plans to turn Reliance into a net carbon zero company by 2035. This will be done by embracing new technologies to convert its carbon dioxide emissions into useful products and chemicals.OLCV said the oil was produced in the US Permian Basin by Occidental and delivered to Reliance in India.""Macquarie arranged and structured the bundled offset supply and retirement,"" it said.The offsets were sourced from a variety of projects verified under the Verra Verified Carbon Standard meeting eligibility criteria for the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).""The volume of offsets applied against the cargo are sufficient to cover the expected GHG emissions from the entire crude lifecycle including oil extraction, transport, storage, shipping, refining, subsequent use, and combustion,"" it said.This type of transaction, which involves the bundling of high-quality carbon offsets with crude oil, is an immediate executable solution that helps promote investments in longer-term, industrial-scale decarbonisation strategies.It is also a step in the furtherance of Occidental's net-zero ambitions and commitment to addressing climate change today.Occidental, the first US-based international energy company to announce an ambition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions associated with the use of its products by 2050, has been using carbon-dioxide in its enhanced oil recovery operations in the Permian for over 40 years.""We are taking important initial steps to work with our customers in hard-to-decarbonize industries to offer carbon-neutral and other low-carbon products that will leverage our expertise in carbon management to lower their total carbon impact and address Scope 3 emissions,"" said Richard Jackson, president of OLCV.

The warrants give entitlement to purchase 3.25 million common shares of Northern Oil and Gas at an exercise price of $14 per share in the next seven years.The deal is another indication of RIL continuous loss of appetite for US shale ventures. The company was the first Indian entity to have invested in the US shale industry. But the company has been exiting the projects since a fall in crude price hit valuation of those investments.RIL had between invested more than $8 billion between 2010 and 2016 for acquiring stakes in three upstream oil exploration joint ventures with Chevron, Pioneer Natural Resource and Carrizo Oil and Gas as well as a midstream (gas processing, storing and marketing) venture with Pioneer.But it began exiting those ventures in 2017, selling the Marcellus shale gas assets in north-eastern and central Pennsylvania for $126 million. The Carrizo-operated assets held by Reliance Marcellus II, a unit of Reliance Holding USA Inc and RIL, were sold to BKV Chelsea, an affiliate of Kalnin Ventures. RIL had bought bought 60% stake in the assets for $392 million in 2010.In June 2015, the company sold its Eagle Ford midstream joint venture with Pioneer Natural Resources for $1 billion. RIL had spent $46 million in acquiring the 49.9 per cent stake in the venture and invested another $208 million over the years.In June 2010, Reliance had invested in the US shale gas business, where it bought a 45 per cent stake in the Eagle Ford shale gas fields, owned by Pioneer, for $1.3 billion.

Amazon did not respond to emailed queries seeking its views on the court order and the future course of action.The high court's order came over an urgent petition moved by FRL after the single member bench directed maintaining status-quo over Future's deal with Reliance. The scheme of arrangement has already received approval from CCI and no objection from SEBI and bourses, following which it had approached NCLT Mumbai on January 26, 2021.Interestingly, market regulator Sebi had barred Kishore Biyani and certain other promoters of Future Retail Ltd last week from the securities market for one year for indulging in insider trading in the shares of the company.However, FRL had stated that the one-year ban will have ""no impact"" on the deal with Reliance Industries. Kishore Biyani, some other promoters and Future Corporate Resources Pvt Ltd (FCRPL) have also appealed against the order passed by the market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).Last month, Amazon had approached the Delhi high court seeking enforcement of the interim order of the Emergency Arbitrator (EA) at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) that had restrained FRL from going ahead with the deal with Reliance.Justice Midha had directed FRL and other parties to maintain status quo till pronouncement of the reserved order.Amazon and Future have been locked in a bitter legal tussle after the US e-commerce giant dragged Future Group to arbitration at SIAC, arguing that the latter had violated their contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance.Amazon had invested in Future Coupons in August 2019 with an option of buying into the flagship Future Retail after a period of three to 10 years. In August last year, Future group had entered into a deal with billionaire Mukesh Ambani's RIL to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units in a Rs 24,713 crore deal.On October 25, 2020, an interim award was passed in favour of Amazon with a single-judge bench of V K Rajah barring Future Retail from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.

With a net worth of about $80 billion, Ambani is again richer than Zhong Shanshan, whose bottled-water company tanked a record 20% this week.The Chinese tycoon is worth $76.6 billion, down more than $22 billion from a peak just last week, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. 81228674Ambani spent most of the past two years leading the ranking of Asia’s richest people, taking over from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s Jack Ma. Then the listing of two companies put Zhong on the map: He grabbed the title from Ambani at the end of December and by early 2021 was the sixth-wealthiest person on Earth, surpassing Warren Buffett.Zhong’s Nongfu Spring Co more than tripled from its initial public offering to a peak in January as investors flocked to consumer shares, while his vaccine maker, Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co, surged as much as 3,757%.But the rally faded as the Hong Kong and Chinese stock markets were among the world’s biggest decliners this week. Nongfu shares have erased their gains for the year, while Wantai’s posted a record monthly plunge.Ambani has focused on pivoting his empire to tech and e-commerce, moving away from energy. Last year, he sold stakes in Reliance’s digital and retail units worth $27 billion to investors including Google and Facebook Inc, lifting his fortune by $18 billion.The spinoff announced this week of the oil-to-chemicals unit -- which accounted for more than 60% of the conglomerate’s revenue in the last fiscal year -- will help the tycoon bring in more investors and expedite a proposed stake sale to Saudi Arabian Oil Co.Zhong and Ambani are not the only two swapping titles lately.

More companies could band together before a March 31 application deadline.In a market where cash is still king, digital payments are quickly gaining ground as India’s 1.3 billion people are starting to embrace online shopping and services such as online gaming and streaming. With India’s smartphone user base approaching 1 billion and Credit Suisse Group AG predicting $1 trillion in online payments in the country in 2023, the companies chosen to enable such transactions stand to reap lucrative commissions.“India’s mobile digital payments is seeing huge growth in a post-pandemic world,” said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and chief executive officer of New Delhi-based payment provider Paytm. “It’s a good time to open up more diverse payments solutions and keep the momentum going.”One of the consortia consists of Amazon, Visa, Indian retail banks ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd as well as fintech startups Pine Labs and BillDesk. Another group is led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd and its partners Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s Google, which together agreed to invest more than $10 billion in Reliance’s digital services unit last year.Sharma’s Paytm heads a group that includes ride-hailing startup Ola and at least five other companies. The fourth consortium consists of Tata Group, Mastercard, telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd and retail banks Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd.Sharma, a spokeswoman for Tata Group and a spokesman for Google declined to comment on the potential bidders. Amazon and Facebook didn’t respond to emailed questions.The contest is fierce as regulator Reserve Bank of India is expected to give just one or two licenses, as implied in its notification inviting bids. The process to decide the winners could take at least six months and it could be a further year or more before the systems and solutions come into use.The winners will take on National Payments Corporation of India, the sole pioneering umbrella organization backed by more than 50 retail banks. Its Unified Payments Interface, or UPI, protocol debuted in 2016 and set the digital payments arena afire by allowing users to link their phone numbers to their bank accounts. That made transferring and receiving money via apps as easy as sending a text message, allowing large scale and high volumes of transactions to happen at minimal cost.“The regulator probably doesn’t want concentration risk as the UPI backbone has become critical to the economy,” said Nandan Nilekani, who conceived and built a biometric identity database the system uses to identify users. “With more licensees and these systems presumably being able to operate seamlessly with each other, the aim seems to be to reinvigorate innovation and push digital payments even deeper into the country,” said Nilekani, co-founder and chairman of IT services company Infosys Ltd.Why Asia is leading the fintech revolutionThough commissions on digital payments are thin, the volume is potentially huge as India tries to reduce its reliance on cash. Card and mobile payments represented only 21% of $781 billion in retail purchases at brick-and-mortar stores in 2019, according to an estimate by S&P Global Market Intelligence.The new licensees could make money by charging businesses transaction fees. They can also break new territory by setting up and operating ATMs, point-of-sale systems, remittance services and new innovative payment solutions.“There seems to be a prime mix of regulatory support and innovation attracting investors to the space right now,” said Anis Uzzaman, general partner and chief executive officer of Silicon Valley-based Pegasus Tech Ventures, an investor in Robinhood and other fintech startups. “A new generation of entrepreneurs is grabbing the opportunity.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/amazon-google-vie-for-piece-of-indias-digital-payment-market/articleshow/81330891.cms,2

This is a 37% rise in the number of global first-time investors who invested in Indian startups, given that the corresponding number stood at 43 in 2019. 81523755Not only did Indian startups attract more foreign investors, they also saw larger bets and raised greater capital for the ecosystem in 2020. The top 10 new global investors in 2020 participated in around $7 billion worth of deals, while this was only $1.2 billion in 2019, data showed. This includes co-investment by other players in the same deals.There were sovereign funds like Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which pooled almost $4 billion into RIL’s fund-raising for its group companies. Other instances of global firms tapping India included Luxor Capital Group’s investment in Zomato, Alkeon Capital’s backing of Byju’s, and South Korea’s NXC Corporation investing in DMI Finance.International investment came in from over 15 countries. Of these, 60% investors had their headquarters in the US, followed by 7% who had their headquarters in Japan and South Korea each. The Middle East region was another major investor base. The investment deals by such first-time international backers were highest in consumer apps and platforms (14 deals) followed by Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) & Artificial Intelligence (AI) at 11 deals.Praxis Global Alliance managing partner and CEO Madhur Singhal said Indian internet companies are scaling up rapidly, prompting global investors to participate in the ecosystem’s growth. “Also, many experienced India fund managers at global investment firms who understand the nuances of the startups here have turned entrepreneurs and set up their own funds,” he added.As of December 2020, India was home to 37 unicorns with 14 companies making it to the elite list in the pandemic year alone.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/startups-see-37-more-first-time-global-backers/articleshow/81518489.cms,2

Biyani, along with others, has been asked to appear in court on April 28.The high court also asked them to show cause as to why they be not detained for 3 months under civil prison for violating emergency arbitrator's order.The high court's order came on Amazon's plea seeking direction to order enforcement of the award by Singapore's EA on October 25, 2020, restraining FRL from going ahead with its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail.The decision is a setback for Future, the country's second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores, which agreed to sell its retail businesses to market leader Reliance last year.However, e-commerce giant Amazon, which had its sights set on ultimately owning part of the retail assets itself, argued a 2019 deal it had with a unit of Future contained clauses prohibiting Future Retail from selling them to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list including Reliance.Amazon had moved the Delhi HC in January to enforce the emergency award (EA) by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), which had asked Future Group not to proceed with the RIL deal till it pronounces a final order. Previously, Future too had approached the HC to stop Amazon from writing to regulators citing the SIAC order, but the court did not grant the injunction and said Amazon was free to write to regulators.(With inputs from agencies)",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/delhi-hc-restrains-future-retail-reliance-deal-on-amazons-plea/articleshow/81570982.cms,1

By 2024, the market is expected to grow to $1.3 trillion.India - population 1.3 billion - has over the years become a sought-after retail destination with a growing base of young and affluent shoppers. The sector contributes 10% to India's gross domestic product and accounts for 8% of India's employment, according to Invest India, the country's investment promotion arm.Mom-and-pop stores and 'kiranas'India's mom-and-pop stores sell everything from clothes and footwear to groceries and electronics. Most of India's grocery retail happens at kiranas - small- and mid-sized mom-and-pop outlets which account for 75-78% of the consumer goods market, Ambit Capital estimates.Store owners typically have a strong and regular customer base in their neighbourhood, with home delivery and taking orders on phone a common phenomenon.Hundreds of household items are crammed inside wall-to-wall glass or wooden shelves, or in the open, at such stores. Many outlets are so small and cramped that customers don't set foot inside - products are handed over by store staff who stand behind a counter.Many of these shops also offer staples - such as pulses, rice and flour - in loose or unbranded form. They typically operate from early morning till late evening.Supermarkets - Modern retailThis segment is a growing trend in India, with companies like Reliance Industries, led by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, Future Retail, led by Kishore Biyani, and Avenue Supermarts' DMart all competing for customers.This segment accounts for about 12-15% of consumer goods sales, according to Ambit. A long-established store format in the West, supermarkets are the polar opposite of kiranas; tidy, well-lit and with plenty of space for customers with shopping carts to seek out items from neatly stacked shelves themselves.Mini-supermarkets in built-up residential areas are also spreading in response to the need to cater to urban shoppers buying supplies in smaller volumes on a daily basis rather than in a once-a-week drill. Most supermarkets operate during usual business hours and shut in late evening.E-commerce - $200 billion market by 2026Shoppers in India are increasingly turning to e-commerce to shop for everything from electronics to groceries, boosted by online discounts and the development of rapid delivery services across the country.While companies such as Amazon.com Inc and Walmart's Flipkart dominate the market, smaller startups have also introduced app-based services for daily delivery of morning essentials like milk and eggs.Boston Consulting Group says e-commerce currently accounts for about 5-6% of Indian retail. But growth is phenomenal: India's e-commerce retail market stood at $30 billion in 2019 but is set to expand by an annual 30% to $200 billion by 2026, Invest India estimates.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-retail-landscape-a-nearly-900-billion-market-dominated-by-mom-and-pop-stores/articleshow/81628781.cms,2

This is Ambani's bet on pitching brands that are basic, yet still aspirational at 'kiranas' - traditional mom-and-pop stores which serve roughly 80% of the retail market in world's second-most populous nation.Already India's biggest retailer, even as a $3.4 billion deal to buy no. 2 player Future Retail awaits clearance, Reliance has ""immense focus"" on private labels, said an industry executive familiar with its strategy. That focus has already made some consumer goods firms in India uneasy, sources say.Reliance plans to keep expanding and promoting its private labels - even in non-food segments - via its own supermarkets and kiranas, the executive said, declining to be identified, like most of the people Reuters interviewed for this story, because of a lack of authorisation to speak with media.""It's a worthwhile and high-margin (play),"" the person said. ""The company's trying to offer brands of an equivalent quality at a lower rate ... from a consumer standpoint, that works. It's a fact, five years down the line, private labels will be a different landscape.""Multi-billion-dollar businessReliance Retail, part of Ambani's Reliance Industries juggernaut, last year raised $6.4 billion by selling a 10% stake to investors including Silver Lake Partners and KKR & Co Inc. The company is now bulking up its e-commerce operations and is increasingly partnering with kiranas to replenish their shelves via its own outlets and warehouses.Consumer brands seeing their products already jostling for space with Reliance's private label brands will have to deal with a company whose grocery supermarket muscle will nearly triple to 2,100 outlets if the Future Retail deal, which is facing a legal challenge at India's Supreme Court, goes through.Browsing shelves in Reliance stores, it's hard to miss their private-label products, made in India mostly by small third-party manufacturers. ""It is Reliance's own brand. So we have to place these prominently,"" a store employee at a Mumbai supermarket said.Inside Reliance's supermarkets, Nestle's Maggi ""2-Minute noodles"" sit next to Snac tac ""Ready in 2 mins"" noodles, both in yellow-coloured packaging with an image of a red bowl full of noodles, with Snac tac costing roughly 18% less. Bottles of Yeah! colas stood beside Coca-Cola and PepsiCo's offerings, at around half the price.Reliance declined to comment on its business strategies. Nestle India didn't answer questions on Snac tac, but said it continues to ""prioritise innovation"" and was confident its consumers will choose brands that serve their needs.India's top consumer goods maker Hindustan Unilever (HUL) declined to comment, while Coca-Cola didn't respond. PepsiCo India said it doesn't comment on strategies of other companies.Lifestyle choiceIndia is seen as offering huge potential. China's per capita consumption of consumer goods is still four times higher than India's, according to HUL, majority-owned by London-listed Unilever. This is despite India's rising disposable incomes.Analysts say Ambani's plans echo private-labels pushes mastered by the world's biggest retailer, Walmart, and German supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl.A key difference is that Western retailers have pitched own-label goods as a value proposition. In India, they act as both an affordable alternative and a lifestyle choice for those previously unused to buying packaged or branded products.Industry executives and analysts say the push is worrying foreign and Indian consumer giants. Pressure has already risen, with online grocers like BigBasket and e-commerce giant Amazon expanding their private brands portfolio.The person familiar with Reliance's strategy said the profit margin it offers to kiranas on products like its noodles could be as high as 20%, compared with the 10-12% offered on similar products by multinationals.To be sure, it's not easy to displace popular, decades-old brands. HUL says nine out of 10 households in India use its brands, and Nestle India says Maggi noodles strengthened its leadership position in 2019.A Jefferies research note said last week Reliance can leverage private labels to onboard more kiranas, but cautioned that ""a success here would require a 360 degree approach"" to compete against ""entrenched"" players.Strategic responseStill, one big Indian consumer firm has been conducting on-ground surveys to study Reliance's model, while a multinational has been forced to ""craft a strategy"" to find ways to safeguard its distribution model, said two executives who declined to be identified citing business sensitivity for their companies.HUL is ""keeping an eye"" on Reliance's private label push, said a person familiar with its thinking.""Any game that Reliance gets into, you have to be careful,"" said the source, referring to Reliance's success in disrupting the telecoms industry with cut-price data plans for smartphones.Alok Shah, a consumer analyst at India's Ambit Capital who has visited stores to assess private labels, said rival consumer companies ought to be alert.""The only option consumer companies have is to market more or to match the pricing of private labels ... Reliance's brands are going to be a much bigger threat,"" he said.Sales representatives of HUL, Nestle and Indian consumer giant ITC interviewed by Reuters at various Reliance supermarkets expressed concerns that similar packaging and lower prices on Reliance brands were luring some customers away. A spokesperson for ITC said, ""All large retailers have their own brands that compete with established brands.""On a recent weekend in Mumbai, shoppers like 16-year-old student Soni Gupta took advantage of a buy-one-get-one-free offer on Reliance noodles.""It's cheaper than Maggi ... I quite like it,"" Gupta said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-retails-private-labels-revolution-spooks-global-consumer-goods-makers/articleshow/81625638.cms,2

But there are others who feel that the liquidity crunch and financial impact will continue to haunt companies in the next financial year, making a case for the continuation of some relief. Sebi has not made any announcements regarding the extension of the exemptions.The exemptions include relaxation of the obligation on a promoter who owns more than 25% in a listed company to make an open offer if s/he increases stake to 10% through creeping acquisition. Also, there is no restriction on an acquirer who holds more than 25% in a listed company from making an open offer if s/he has acquired the company’s shares in the preceding 52 weeks. Sebi has also extended the validity of regulatory approval for launching IPOs and rights issues till March 31.81626035These exemptions, along with other factors like attractive valuations, resulted in robust fund-raising by companies through rights offers, IPOs and preferential issuances despite the lockdown. “The relaxations were made with two key perspectives in mind. First, to facilitate fund-raising during the pandemic since it was expected that most businesses would need emergency cash to tide over the crisis. Second, to ease difficulties in compliance requirements that necessitated periodic filings or sending of physical documents to shareholders or regulators,” said J Sagar Associates partner Vikram Raghani.Reliance Industries, Mahindra Finance and Aditya Birla Fashion, among others, launched their rights offers, while Gland Pharma, Happiest Minds, Burger King, etc, debuted in the stock market with their IPOs during the pandemic. The exemptions also facilitated the Tata Sons plan to increase stake in Tata Power by 10% through a preferential issue without making an open offer.Law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas partner Mukul Sharma said that certain exemptions like flexibility in pricing of preferential issue and shortening of restriction period for fund-raising after buyback were relevant in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, and not so much almost a year later. However, he thinks that since the financial impact of the lockdown is likely to continue to affect companies even in fiscal 2022, exemptions such as those on creeping acquisition limit, eligibility criteria for fast-track rights’ issue and minimum subscription for rights issue should be continued. “That will allow companies the flexibility to raise more funds.”Raghani, on the other hand, feels that since businesses and markets have more or less stabilised, relaxations are not likely to be extended.The corporate affairs ministry has permitted companies to hold board meetings and conduct annual shareholder meetings or AGMs through video-conferencing until June and December respectively. “Given the imminent threat of virus mutations and subsequent waves of infections, virtual shareholder meetings will continue to be normal,” said Sharma.Dhir and Dhir Associates associate partner Ashish Pyasi said the relaxations were intended for the lockdown period, but the number of Covid cases is on the rise and normalcy still far away. “Lifting the relaxations will add to companies’ stress.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cos-look-for-support-as-sebi-sops-set-to-end/articleshow/81621357.cms,0

This is the third straight reduction in rate in one year. The price was cut by a steep 26 per cent to $2.39 in April last year.The rate paid to producers of new gas from difficult fields such as deepsea was cut to $4.06 per mmBtu from $5.61.The rate from October 1 is equivalent to the price paid to ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL) prior to May 2020 when formula-based pricing was first introduced.ONGC, sources said, had posted Rs 4,272 crore loss on gas business in 2017-18, which is likely to widen to over Rs 6,000 crore in the current fiscal (April 2020 to March 2021), they said.ONGC has seen incurring losses on the 65 million standard cubic meters per day of gas it produces from domestic fields shortly after the government in November 2014 introduced a new gas pricing formula that had ""inherent limitations"" as it was based on pricing hubs of gas surplus countries such as the US, Canada, and Russia.Sources said ONGC in a recent communique to the government has stated that the break-even price to produce gas from new discoveries was in the range of $5-9 per mmBtu.In May 2010, the government had raised the rate of gas sold to power and fertiliser firms from $1.79 per mmBtu to $4.20. ONGC and OIL got $3.818 per mmBtu price for the gas they produced from fields given to them on a nomination basis and after adding a 10 per cent royalty, the fuel cost $4.20 per mmBtu for consumers.The Congress-led UPA had approved a new pricing formula for implementation in 2014 that would have raised the rates but the BJP-led government scrapped it and brought a new formula.The new formula takes into account the volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (the UK), Alberta (Canada), and Russia with a lag of one-quarter. Prices are set every six months — on April 1 and October 1 each year.The rate at the first revision, using the new formula, came to $5.05 but in the subsequent six-monthly reviews kept falling till it touched $2.48 for April 2017 to September 2017 period.Subsequently, it rose to $3.69 in April 2019-September 2019 before being cut by 12.5 per cent in October 2019 to $3.23.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gas-price-for-ongc-to-inch-up-to-1-82-fall-below-4-for-reliance-bp/articleshow/81650316.cms,1

HMEL operates a 226,000 barrel per day (bpd) Bathinda refinery in the northern state of Punjab.India has asked refiners to speed up the diversification of imports to cut their dependence on Middle Eastern crudes after Opec+ decided this month to extend production cuts through April, two sources said.As Opec's share in India's oil imports fell to historic lows between April 2020 and January 2021, the refining powerhouse began making preparations to import Guyanese crude while renewing a key supply contract between top refiner Indian Oil Corp Ltd and Russia.The 1 million-barrel cargo of Guyana's Liza light sweet crude set sail on March 2 on Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Sea Garnet bound for India's Mundra port, where it is set to arrive around April 8. The cargo's charterer is Trafigura, according to the Eikon data.Guyana's natural resources minister, Vickram Bharrat, told Reuters this month that the crude onboard the Sea Garnet had been originally allocated to New York-based Hess Corp, one of the companies producing crude in Guyana along with Exxon Mobil Corp, and delivered to Trafigura. Bharrat said he did not know the identity of the cargo's ultimate buyer.Trafigura, Hess and HMEL declined to comment on commercial matters.Since Guyana began exporting crude in early 2020, its oil has flowed mainly to the United States, China, Panama and the Caribbean, according to tanker-tracking data.India was a prominent importer of Venezuelan oil, but tight US sanctions on the South American country have since 2019 limited the volume India can buy, if it is even allowed.India did not receive any Venezuelan crude imports in February for a third consecutive month due to Washington's suspension of oil-for-fuel swaps between state-run PDVSA and Reliance Industries Ltd since October. That compares with 371,300 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan oil that arrived in Indian ports in February 2020.Besides Russia, North American producers Canada, the United States and Mexico have gained market share by selling heavy crude grades to India.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hpcl-mittal-first-indian-company-to-buy-guyanese-crude-liza-report/articleshow/81666158.cms,0

Murthy also emphasised that the interest of the company must always come ahead of the interest of the individual and that, when in doubt, disclose it. These are some of the principles the IT services major has been following right from its inception. Kotak Mahindra Bank MD Uday Kotak said that founders may not be there, but their institutions remain, citing examples of renowned financial services brands like Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan. Entrepreneurs need to be thinking about transformative change, which requires some bets in the short run, for building a more sustainable future, Kotak said. Another panel member Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said that women entrepreneurs face challenges in accessing capital as there is a perception that they are not risk-takers. Women need to have much more confidence in themselves and take big bets in the sector they operate in, Shaw said. Before the panel discussion, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, in his keynote address at the virtual award ceremony, said that startup entrepreneurs must be ready to work with limited resources but with unlimited determination, adding that they should not be deterred by failure, because only after many failures there is success. “Today, India is surging ahead as an economic power, as a democratic power, as a diplomatic and strategic power, as a cultural power and also a digital and technology power. And the key driving force for India’s rise will be our entrepreneurs, who are inventing new things every day that can transform India and the world, who are disruptive and hungry for success.” Marico chairman Harsh Mariwala won the EY EOY Award. He will now represent India at the EY World EOY Award on June 10. Mariwala transformed his family’s edible oil trading business into a consumer products major, Marico, whose several brands are household names in India.

With no prior business experience, Reddy, a US-trained cardiologist, returned to India and built the country’s first corporate hospital in Chennai in 1983.

There are two reasons for my confidence.""Firstly, our PM Narendra Modi has been advocating a greater role for the private sector in India's future development,"" Ambani said at the EY Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Last month, Modi had pitched for greater importance of the private sector, stating that the culture of abusing the private sector is no longer acceptable.Ambani said the second reason for the 'tsunami of opportunities' is the availability of technologies which can be utilised for helping 1.3 billion Indians meet their aspirations.""We have the potential in the coming decades to be among the top three economies of the world. New sectors like clean energy, education, healthcare, life sciences and biotechnology, and transformation of existing agricultural, industrial and service sectors offer unprecedented opportunities,” Ambani said.Indian entrepreneurs are now capable of providing world-beating quality to meet the needs of our market at the most competitive costs, he said, adding this opens up the entire global market for Indian entrepreneurs.In a message to young entrepreneurs on the verge of starting new enterprises, Ambani said they should not be deterred by failures and made it clear that success awaits them after the setbacks.""You will script far better success stories for India than my generation,"" he added.Speaking at the event, Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy said corporate leaders have to assemble a group of thinkers from the society to recognize and understand the complete list of risks which a business faces, and added that he is “humbled” by the pandemic.Kotak Mahindra Bank's Uday Kotak said business has to go beyond quarter-to-quarter and convince investors that the company is building something which will be a bigger success in the future.

These include one where Reliance Industries has tied up with Facebook and Google, another led by Paytm which has companies like Ola, while there is one led by the Tata Group with Mastercard, Bharti Airtel, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank as partners.The extended deadline for making the applications ended on Wednesday.ICICI Bank and Axis Bank will be co-leading the consortium with a 20 per cent stake each, officials in the know told PTI.Other partners, including Amazon, Billdesk, Pine Labs and Visa will be holding a stake of 15 per cent each, they said.The scope of activities for the NUE as mandated by RBI includes payment systems in the retail space like ATMs, white label point of sale terminals, Aadhar-based payment systems and remittance services, operation of clearing and settlement systems for participating banks and non-banks, be interoperable with NPCI, and participate in the Reserve Bank's payment and settlement systems.

Within 12 months, the sensex recorded its sharpest slide on record and then, from near a multi-year low level, rallied to its all-time peak past the 52,500-point mark by mid-February. However, with several positive and negative factors impacting markets globally, the index closed the financial year 2020-21 at 49,509 points, up 68% on the year.The rally in FY21 attracted foreign fund managers into the market like never before with the total net inflow for the financial year at almost Rs 2.75 lakh crore — also an all-time high figure, data from CDSL showed.For market veterans, the sharp rally of FY21 was a deja vu moment. Joseph Thomas of Emkay Wealth Management pointed out that the uptick in FY21 came on the back of a sharp drawdown witnessed towards the close of FY20, which had recorded a negative return of about 30%. That was quite similar to the base that was created in FY09 when markets corrected by 40% due to the global financial crisis, which was swiftly followed by close to 80% returns for FY10. “The fall in markets due to severe economic distress proved to be the best investment opportunity (in FY21). The star performers among individual sectors were IT, pharma and banking,” Thomas said.With the Covid vaccines being rolled out at a fast pace across the globe and signs of economic revival emerging from various parts of the world, FY22 could also be a good year. “As we enter the new financial year, there is a ray of hope that the economic performance will continue with support from fiscal and monetary policies, and the second wave of the pandemic may be well under control as the vaccine rollout is under way across the globe,” Thomas said.The year’s rally also made investors richer by a record Rs 94 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 206 lakh crore. A major part of this gain came from the sharp rally in Reliance Industries, which saw its market capitalisation more than double from Rs 7.05 lakh crore to over Rs 15 lakh crore, but closed the year at Rs 13.2 lakh crore.The year also saw a record amount of funds being raised through the IPO route at Rs 1.9 lakh crore and Rs 64,256 crore through the rights offer route. RIL, which successfully closed its Rs 53,124-crore rights offer during the year, was the biggest equity issue in the country’s history.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/from-plunge-to-peak-a-turbulent-fiscal-for-sensex/articleshow/81791174.cms,0

They were penalised for alleged irregularities relating to the issue of 12 crore equity shares in January 2000 by Reliance Industries (RIL). Sebi imposed the penalty on Ambani family members and related entities since it was found that the takeover code was violated during the allotment of shares by RIL.According to Sebi’s order, in January 2000, RIL allotted 12 crore shares to 38 entities from within the Reliance Group. The allotment was made after exercise of the option on warrants attached with 6 crore non-convertible debentures (NCDs), which were issued in 1994. From the disclosure filed with the bourses by RIL, it was found that these 38 entities were ‘persons acting in concert’ (PACs) with RIL promoters. Through this conversion, RIL promoters together with the PACs had increased their stake in the company from 22.7% as of end-March 1999 to 38.3% as of end-March 2000. Out of these, 7.8% shares were acquired as a result of a merger and hence were exempt under the then prevailing Takeover Regulations.However, 6.8% shares that were acquired by RIL promoters together with PACs in exercise of 3 crore warrants were alleged to be in excess of the 5% ceiling under the same regulation. Hence the imposition of the Rs 25-crore fine on these entities, the Sebi order said.RIL was yet to comment on the Sebi order, which was issued on Wednesday evening. Sebi said that the Ambani brothers and all the other entities named in the order jointly and severally would pay the total fine within 45 days of the receipt of the order.The order noted that while determining the quantum of penalty, no quantifiable figures or data were available on record to assess the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage and amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default committed by the entities. “However, the fact remains that the (RIL group entities and promoters) by their failure to make public announcement, deprived the shareholders of their statutory rights/ opportunity to exit from the company,” it noted.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-fines-ambani-brothers-rs-25cr-in-21-year-old-case/articleshow/81958202.cms,1

Hamleys, a British retail icon that hasn’t made a profit for a number of years, plans to quadruple its outlets in the former British colony to more than 500 in three years despite the pandemic, according to Darshan Mehta, chief executive officer of Ambani’s Reliance Brands Ltd. Besides the main growth market, the company is also adding stores from Europe to South Africa and China, he said in an interview.Ambani, 63, bought Hamleys in 2019 to strengthen his retail footprint as part of the ongoing transformation of his oil-and-chemicals conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd into a consumer and technology behemoth. The deep pockets of Asia’s richest man and India’s demographics could help breathe new life into Hamleys, whose share of global toy sales was estimated at 0.6% last year by Euromonitor International, and see it avert the pitfalls faced by rivals such as Toys “R” Us Inc.With a backer whose net worth is $72 billion, Hamleys is seeking to tap into what it sees as an inadequately serviced section of India’s almost 1.4 billion people, of which about 27% are children under 14. The country accounts for just 1% of the $90 billion global toy industry, meaning the potential for growth is high, Mehta said.“There is a lot of headroom and India is no way near saturation,” Mehta said. “We are now mulling how we can roll out stores in newer geographies and new formats.”Hamleys stores are famed for the carnival-like experience, allowing children to race toy cars, enjoy model train sets and play various games. In a country like India, with its densely packed cities and limited entertainment options, such an environment could be a hook to get customers to visit again. Product prices appealing to buyers of modest means as well as the super-rich make Hamleys an “elastic brand,” said Mehta.In Asia, Hamleys is seen as “high class and it’s on par with Harrods in some ways,” said Marc Alonso, a London-based senior research analyst at Euromonitor. “So it’s attracting that customer base, which is why in some places like India and China, it has been seeing some good sales growth in the past few years.”While the pandemic has been hitting parts of India’s economy, Mehta sees the toy industry as ""recession proof"" because many families choose the happiness of kids over anything else. But other chains have struggled before the virus. Toys “R” Us was the biggest victim of the US retail apocalypse when it filed for bankruptcy in 2017, crushed by debt and felled by competition from online sellers such as Amazon.com Inc.Though the American chain is on a recovery path now under a new owner, a protracted pandemic points to an uncertain future for retailers.Nailing online sales is key to avoiding the fate of other high-end toy chains, according to Reliance. As part of Ambani’s e-commerce and technology pivot, his group is building Jiomart, a shopping portal, to take on giants such as Amazon.com and Walmart Inc’s Flipkart in the local market. Reliance Industries has roped in Facebook Inc and Google as investors to fuel those ambitions.With Covid-19 accelerating the group’s digital strategy, Mehta expects 30% of Hamleys’ sales coming from orders online in five years, versus 20% now. Direct selling over the phone or via WhatsApp would account for 20% in the same period, he said.Euromonitor’s Alonso said that target may be too ambitious because some customers could go to another portal that offers cheaper prices. “You can get the same product much cheaper by going straight to Lego, for example, on their e-commerce site,” said Alonso.Founded by William Hamley in 1760, Hamleys has seen its share of troubles. Ownership of the London-based chain has changed at least three times in the past decade alone -- from an Icelandic bank to a French group and then to a Chinese fashion retailer. Two years ago, Ambani snapped it up for about $89 million in cash. Hamleys’ most recent books for 2019 show a loss of almost 9 million pounds ($12.4 million) on revenue of about 48 million pounds.UK Retailers Prepare For Lockdown EasingEnvironmental services clean outside of the Regent Street store ahead of a reopening last year, on June 11. The flagship store has been closed for much of the past year. The onset of the pandemic just months after Reliance took control compounded Hamleys’ financial distress in the UK, where it runs 21 outlets. Like most shops in the deserted streets of London, its grand seven-story Regent Street flagship store that opened in 1881 remained closed for much of the past year until earlier this week, while it cut a quarter of its staff to weather the crisis.Mehta believes the UK operations will “come out very strongly” with non-essential stores reopening this week following the easing of curbs. Another coronavirus wave could temporarily disrupt the business globally -- like delayed plans for the US, a market it wants to crack.Prior to the acquisition of the chain, Reliance had the master franchise for Hamleys in India. The retail unit of Reliance is also the local partner for over 45 international brands including Burberry, Hugo Boss, Jimmy Choo and Tiffany & Co, according to the company’s website.The pandemic has limited Hamleys’ India target to just about 50 new stores this year before the roll out picks up pace. The toy retailer is looking at outlets in the US this year or next, depending on travel restrictions, as well as in tourist hot spots in European countries, including France and Italy, the Reliance executive said.Still, India is likely to be a key market, said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors. With about 26 million children born in the country each year, Hamleys is unlikely to be short of customers there even if only the top 5% of the population can afford to shop at its store, he said.“Toys is one category where emotions sometimes overtake your financial abilities,” said Singhal. “Hamleys is probably one of the best investments from Mr. Ambani’s point of view in retail -- the visibility the Hamleys brand has in India is unparalleled.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/asias-richest-man-mukesh-ambani-rebuilds-a-261-year-old-british-icon/articleshow/82043851.cms,1

In the two-prong partnership, AdaniConneX will build their new Tier 4 data centre and Adani Logistics, India’s leader in logistics, will build their 534,000 sqft fulfilment centre. Thousands of new jobs in Mumbai,” Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Group said on Twitter.The deal marks yet another stride by the Adani group, which has business interests across sectors ranging from commodities to infrastructure.Set to be operational in the third quarter of 2022, the warehouse will have the capacity to store one crore units of inventory, the companies said. In addition, Flipkart will build its third data centre at Adaniconnex, a joint venture between EdgeConneX and Adani Enterprises in Chennai, which is expected to help the Bengaluru-headquartered e-tailer store its data locally within India.“This broad-ranging partnership across our logistics and data centre businesses is a unique business model, and we see this as a great opportunity to serve Flipkart’s physical as well as digital infrastructure needs,” said Karan Adani, CEO at Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ).",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/flipkart-ties-up-with-adani-for-logistics-data-hub/articleshow/82040815.cms,2

The penal charges too will be waived under the recast plan.The recast plan has been approved by a RBI-constituted expert committee headed by K V Kamath.Banking sources said the debt recast is actually 'Plan B' to help the nation's largest retailer stay afloat. The recast will kick in only if the deal to sell Future's retail, wholesales, warehousing and logistics assets to Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) does not go through.If the Reliance deal goes through, the recast plan will be withdrawn.Lenders, they said, are still banking on 'Plan A' which is asset sale to RIL.So far, the consortium of lenders has approved the debt restructuring of Future Retail Ltd (FRL), Future Enterprises ltd (FEL) and Future Supply Chain Solutions Ltd. The restructuring plans of FEL and FRL have received approval from the RBI-constituted expert panel, sources said.The Rs 24,713 crore deal between RIL and Future Group was announced in August last year but it is getting delayed as e-Commerce major Amazon is contesting it at several forums, including an arbitration at SIAC and before the Supreme Court, which on Monday stayed the ongoing proceedings before the Delhi High Court.Citing delay, RRVL has also extended the timeline for the deal to be completed by six months to September 30, 2021.According to industry sources, debt resolution plans for two more Kishore Biyani-led Future Group companies -- Future Consumers and Future Lifestyle -- are also expected to be cleared by the consortium of lenders.The Expert Committee under the chairmanship of veteran banker K V Kamath has approved the debt resolution plans of FEL and FRL as permitted under the Reserve Bank of India''s resolution Framework for Covid-related stress, said the source.The RBI has set up a five-member expert committee under Kamath to suggest financial parameters for resolution of coronavirus-related stressed assets and all debt having aggregate exposure of Rs 1,500 crore or above have to be validated by it.The lenders and the board of both Future Group companies have already approved the respective restructuring plans. Now the companies and the lenders would have to complete other formalities and submit it finally before the RBI, the source added.Earlier this week, lenders of Future Supply Chain Solutions Ltd also approved the debt restructuring plan of the company, but as its total debt was below Rs 1,500 crore, it does not require approval from the Kamath panel.Future Supply Chain Solutions Ltd is the group's logistics company. It provides warehousing, distribution and other logistics solutions.A reply from Future Group regarding the development could not be ascertained by the time of filing of the story.FRL, which operates retail chain stores under several formats including Big Bazaar, fbb, HyperCity etc, has a consortium of 28 lenders and FEL has 19 lenders.Though both the companies have not specified their total debt under the restructuring in their regulatory filing but according to reports from Care Ratings, FRL has a loan of Rs 6,278 crore as of October 2020, and FEL has a loan of Rs 1,777 crore as of December 2020.FEL's loan includes long-term term loans of Rs 528 crore, long-term fund-based bank facilities of Rs 3,250 crore, and short-term non-fund based bank facilities of Rs 2,500 crore.While FRL debt includes long-term term loans of Rs 528 crore, long-term fund-based bank facilities of Rs 3,250 crore, and short-term non-fund based bank facilities of Rs 2,500 crore.The restructure would cover FRL's working capital demand loans, term loans, cash credit, short term loans, Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs), purchase bill discounting limits, other working capital loans and unpaid interest, which became overdue, it added.The e-Commerce major Amazon, which had invested in Future Coupons in August 2019, with an option of buying into the flagship Future Retail after a period of three to 10 years, is opposing the deal, claiming the first right.On October 25, 2020, an interim order was passed in favour of Amazon with a single-judge bench of V K Rajah barring Future Retail from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.The Supreme Court on Monday stayed the ongoing proceedings before the Delhi high court in the case related to the amalgamation of FRL with Reliance Retail.

This would rise to 69 mmscmd in FY23 and 75 mmscmd in FY24.Reliance-BP combine, which in December last year brought newer fields in their eastern offshore KG-D6 block to production, would lead to the rise in gas output by non-PSUs. Its output, which was 11 mmscmd in 2020-21, would rise to 38 mmscmd by FY24, the brokerage estimated.It projected domestic gas demand to climb from 153.8 mmscmd in FY21 (April 2020 to March 2021) to 215.5 mmscmd in 2024-25.India's domestic gas production is inadequate to meet all its requirements and the deficit is met through imports in form of liquefied natural gas (LNG).HDFC Securities said the KGD6 consortium has sought bids from customers as it intends to sell an additional 5.5 mmscmd of gas from the Krishna Godavari (KG) Basin block, off the eastern coast of India.The additional gas will be available for sale at the delivery point at Gadimoga, near Kakinada, tentatively from the last week of April or early May 2021.ONGC has also floated the tender for prospective buyers to bid for gas supplies from its KG-DWN-98/2 field in the KG Basin offshore. The company will supply 2 mmscmd of gas from the field to the Odalarevu onshore terminal in Andhra Pradesh, which should commence from June 2021.""This increasing gas supply from domestic sources should drive earnings growth and valuations for the Indian gas utilities, especially the gas transmission companies,"" it said.Tenders to sell gas from the KG Basin indicate that ramp-up in domestic gas production is faster than investor expectation, it said.""The tenders from the KG-D6 consortium and ONGC to sell gas from KG Basin underscores our thesis of rising domestic gas production. These and earlier tenders indicate a total increase of about 20 mmscmd (23 per cent of FY20 domestic supply) in the supply of gas from domestic sources over December 2020 to July 2021.""The KG-D6 consortium has already signed the Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement (GSPA) with buyers to sell 4.8 mmscmd and 7.5 mmscmd of gas from KGD6 Basin in November-19 and February-21, respectively.The consortium has commenced gas production from R-cluster, an ultra-deepwater gas field, in December 2020. R-cluster is the first of the three projects to come on stream. The production from the Satellites Cluster and MJ field is expected to start by mid-2021 and 2022, respectively. Peak gas production from the three fields is expected to be 30 mmscmd by 2023.ONGC has commenced gas production from KG-DWN-98/2 in March 2020.

The Football Sports Development Limited, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries that operates ISL with the All India Football Federation (AIFF), had offered to the Indian cricket board (BCCI) for the construction of a safe central bio-secure bubble for the 2021 edition of IPL.The eleven-franchise ISL was conducted between November 20, 2020 and March 13, 2021 - a total of 114 days. The overall bubble to conduct this league and its operations came into effect from the start of September until the end of the tournament - 195 days. Having implemented it successfully, FSDL offered the draft to the BCCI for safe conduct of the IPL. This idea was 'politely turned down' by BCCI. 82513116When this year's IPL was planned, Covid-19 was on the wane, there was a sense of relative security and of a sense that the worst was over. BCCI decided to host the 52-day IPL, involving 60 matches, across six cities. It decided to have it at six different centres, believing in the fact that the European football leagues had been successful in doing it. It did not hire a central IT and safety firm. In doing so, did it expose itself to the risk of flying between matches, not constructing a central bio-bubble?What worked for ISL was that it could provide for enough manpower, enough RT-PCR tests and the logistics to ensure that nothing went wrong. The FSDL spent an approximate Rs 17 crore on the safety measures. ISL zeroed in on three potential venues to host the league - Goa, Kerala and Kolkata - but eventually decided to do away with Kerala and Kolkata because of the impending state elections. BCCI's six venues to host the IPL included Kolkata and Chennai, where elections were being planned. ""It had to be one city,"" ISL sources said. 82496482Soon after the ISL ended, FSDL chairperson Nita Ambani said: ""In spite of the global pandemic, despite the odds against us, the fear and uncertainty, this season of ISL has brought immense joy, cheer and celebrations back into our lives.""In fact, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly himself spoke of the league's bio-bubble highly. ""The successful completion of the ISL in these challenging times is indeed a new benchmark for the Indian sports industry."" However, what is clear is that IPL got caught in a nightmarish second wave when the monster was air borne.

But if the month-on-month inflation data shows a surge, the dovish Fed will be forced to take it seriously.The fact that the market is a bit apprehensive of rising inflation is reflected in the US 10-year yield rising above 1.6 per cent, he said.""So, this space has to be watched. Meanwhile in India Q4 results continue to be good with better than expected performance from mid-small-caps.

Krishna Babu, along with Covid-19 special officer Arja Srikanth, health commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar, joint collector A S Dinesh Kumar and senior divisional commercial manager Narendra Varma visited Container Cargo Corporation Limited (Concor) depot at New Guntur railway station on Sunday to receive the second Oxygen Express from Reliance Industries in Jamnagar. The train carrying 76.39 MT of oxygen reached Guntur station in the early hours of Sunday.Taking into account the shortage of oxygen in the state, the Centre had directed the Railways to operate a special oxygen express to carry liquid medical oxygen (LMO) to the state. In view of the rise in Covid-19 cases and a surge in demand for LMO, Indian Railways created a signal-free ‘green corridor’ to provide safe, secure, hassle-free and fast transportation of oxygen to different parts of the country.The four containers of the train were dispatched to different locations in Krishna, West Godavari, Prakasam and Guntur districts.Speaking to the media, Krishna Babu said about 30,000 out of 50,000 beds with oxygen facility were created in government and private hospitals. He said the state would require more oxygen in view of surge in cases. The chief minister has already brought the issue to the notice of the Prime Minister and sought an additional quota of LMO, he said.“The oxygen train started from Reliance Rail Terminal, Kanalus in Gujarat on Friday at 8.31 pm and reached its destination in 31.30 hours thanks to the green corridor created by the Railways,” said Krishna Babu.

Of the 30 index constituents, five closed in the red with Bharti Airtel, down 2.4%, contributing the most to the loss.The day’s rally also added nearly Rs 3 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 218.7 lakh crore.

Among the accused named in the FIR are photographer Colston Julian, Kwan Entertainment co-founder Anirban Blah, actor-producer Jackky Bhagnani, Krishan Kumar of T-Series, Aha CEO Ajit Thakur, Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamat, producer Vishnu Induri, Sheel Gupta and Gurjot Singh.--- TNNMODEL ALLEGES REPEATED SEXUAL ABUSEOn April 12, the model took to her social media handle and wrote a long post, in which she gave an account of the abuse she allegedly faced over the years. Talking to Bombay Times, she says, âThese incidents took place over a span of four years from 2013 to 2019. I have accused 11 people, but the police have registered an FIR against only nine of them, stating that they canât register a complaint about incidents that have taken place outside Mumbai.â She adds, âI met DCP Zone X Dr Maheshwar Reddy on April 1 and thought that I would be able to register a complaint, which will be converted into an FIR immediately, but it happened only recently (May 26).âTalking about her complaint against Colston, she alleges, âI had been with him briefly from 2014 to 2015. During that time, he abused me physically, hit me, and raped me. I severed all ties with him and even blocked him from everywhere. However, he got in touch with me via email in March 2017, after almost seven months. He called me to his residence for a photoshoot, which he had promised on our first meeting. He tried to kiss me and get intimate with me again. When I pushed him away, he hit me and slapped me hard a couple of times. I fell, and my head hit the wall. I somehow managed to get out of that place. I was in tears and in complete shock at what he tried to do with me.ââAjit (Thakur) tried to molest me at a party. They didnât think I would proceed with my complaint. They wanted me to take down my posts. In April Ajit told me that my Bollywood career would be over and I would be abandoned, nobody would work with me if I went ahead with my posts on social media,â she alleges.Talking about the others she had named in the FIR, she claims, âI knew Krishan Kumar from before. I had first met him at his office. Later, he invited me to a restaurant at Kamala Mills. He tried to kiss me outside the restaurant, but I managed to push him away. He offered to drop me home and kissed me forcibly near my residence.âShe alleges, âIn 2018, I had attended a party at Jackkyâs residence, and he told me that he would like to show me his house. He took me to a different floor, it was dark, and he made a lewd suggestionâ¦ I refused and left immediately.âACCUSED DENY THE CLAIMS, PLAN TO TAKE THE LEGAL ROUTEAfter the model approached the police in May, photographer Colston Julian denied the accusations in a social media post. âDear all. It has come to my notice that a social media post and news article with entirely false and spiteful accusations are making certain claims against me. My lawyers are following the official process and are responding to the situation legally (sic),â he wrote. On Colstonâs behalf, his lawyer Ravina Rajpal told BT, âIt is a false case, we will cooperate with the authorities concerned in all ways possible. The matter is pending investigation and is sub judice. We are also exploring legal remedies including defamation in due course.âIn 2018, Anirban Blah was accused of seeking sexual favour from several women. Subsequently, as per reports, he had to step down from the board of trustees of Kwan, the talent management company he had co-founded. When BT reached out to Anirban regarding these new allegations against him, he answered the phone but said that he doesnât talk to the media.Ajit Thakur had also resigned from his post as the content studio head at Reliance Industries in 2018 after allegations of sexual misconduct levelled against him. He is currently the CEO of Aha. About the current allegations against him, his legal counsel on his behalf stated, âThe allegations made are false, malicious and motivated. It is nothing more than an attempt to smear my reputation. In fact, I have evidence, which indicates that the complainant was attempting to blackmail me amongst several others and when her attempts failed, she resorted to registering an FIR with baseless allegations. I will take all the necessary legal action against her and I am certain that truth will prevail.âResponding to the accusation, Krishan Kumar of T-Series says, âThis is all bullshit! It has been over a year that she has been threatening me and blackmailing me, asking for money. I have all her chats from the first day up to April 2021. I have also recorded her a few times when she tried to say things on the phone. When the police call me, I will give all the evidence to them and they can figure out who is right and who is wrong. I will bring it out in the media also eventually. I want people to know how some people are taking advantage of others nowadays. A girl has the right to go to the police and state what she wants, I appreciate that, but some people take advantage of this right. I am not talking about all, but some people do. I have all the proofs. I met her for the first time at a friendâs party and I must have met her twice or thrice in my life.â Till the time of going to press, Jackky Bhagnani did not respond to our calls or messages.Chaitanya Siriprolu, DCP operations and Mumbai Police spokesperson, said in a statement, âOne offence under Section 376 (commits rape repeatedly on the same woman) and Section 354 (molestation) is registered on 26 May at Bandra police station on the complaint of a 28-year-old lady against nine accused.â",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/fir-filed-against-nine-from-showbiz-after-model-alleges-sexual-assault-those-charged-deny-claims-allege-blackmail/articleshow/83125587.cms,1

Flipkart may look at new categories such as epharmacy, online food delivery and healthcare.”RIL, which raised $15 billion last year from several investors, including Silver Lake, Facebook, Google and KKR, has been doubling down on its e-commerce play with Jiomart and Ajio. Similarly, the Tata Group, which operates Tata Cliq, acquired 64.3% in online grocer BigBasket for $1.5-2 billion and followed it up by investing $75 million in health and fitness startup Curefit. It is also closing in on online pharmacy 1mg.Flipkart, which raised $1.2 billion from parent Walmart last year, has been busy too.

However, investors are optimistic about fund raising environment in 2021, primarily due to a rising limited partners' confidence in the Indian market, the report said.High traction is expected in IT/ITES, consumer tech, and healthcare sectors going forward, the report, adding that the BFSI sector is also set for recovery.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-industries-stake-sales-lead-to-38-jump-in-pe-investments-in-2020-report/articleshow/83374677.cms,1

Convener of Empowered Group on Oxygen & road transport and highway secretary Giridhar Aramane spoke to TOI about the plans.While the Covid caseload has decreased in urban areas, there are concerns relating to rural areas and we need to be prepared for the future. What is the government’s plan?Medical oxygen supply has been a very sensitive issue. The government has given a lot of thought while deciding how to ensure that all patients receive all medical supplies including oxygen. That’s why an empowered group was constituted and the government gave all the powers to procure oxygen without any delay. So, the first task was to increase the supply. Fundamental economic law says when supply increases, automatically the clamour for hoarding will come down. The government concentrated on ensuring availability of adequate quantity and several measures were taken. The first was, operating all the liquid oxygen plants to their full capacity. Second was increasing the capacity by technical improvement; like some manufacturers made some short term improvement to the technology and brought about 5-10% increase in production. One or two plants were commissioned in the last one year. Capacity of Reliance Industries went up from 300 to 1,000 tonnes a day. The other important thing was operating all these plants at their maximum capacity. They were producing 25-30% above their actual capacity. Third important measure was that the government realised that some areas don’t have any oxygen plants. So, under the PM Cares fund, 162 PSA plants were sanctioned. By now we have installed 102 of them and the remaining will be installed and commissioned in the next one month. Another 1,051 PSA plants under the PM Cares fund have been approved. So, every district will get at least one and some will get more than one. This entire system will create capacity for generating another 2,500 tonnes of medical oxygen. Some top companies are manufacturing these plants. Our total capacity after installation of these plants will go up to around 12,500 tonnes per day, which was barely around 6,000 tonnes last year.What is the plan for meeting demands in rural areas?Rural areas also need medical oxygen and we have to supply this in a different manner. We can’t put such PSA plants in 50 bedded or 30 bedded health centres. There, we will have to supply through cylinders. Last year the government procured around 7 lakh cylinders and distributed them throughout the country. The total cylinder available has gone up from 4.5 lakhs to 11 lakhs in the last one year. Another 1.27 lakh are being distributed to states and orders have been placed for 1.5 lakh more cylinders. Apart from cylinders the government is also procuring oxygen concentrators for mild and moderate patients under PM Cares funds. This will be useful in smaller locations.There are some inputs that private hospitals are not keen to put PSA plants for certain interests. How is the government dealing with this?My information is that even private hospitals are very interested in having these plants because they have realized that in a crisis having some in-house capacity will help, if not for 500 beds. Big hospitals may have at least these plants to cater to ICU requirements that will ensure that they have emergency supply. So, in a way that will ensure an increase in availability and the requirement for transportation and logistics will also reduce. What the government has done is it has created a supply system for PSA plants also. So, we have enabled large scale manufacturers in the country who will be able to supply a large number of PSA plants in short terms. The private hospitals can also buy them at lower cost and get better quality. We have also tied up the maintenance and the companies will maintain them.So, will this be some kind of permanent solution? Will this help us prepare for any future crisis?This will be a permanent solution. Once all these PSA plants are installed, there will be no such big problem with medical oxygen demand.How did you manage the crisis when every state was demanding more medical oxygen and amid several accusations?In a crisis, India reacts as one. The Prime Minister had meetings with the CMs and all officers; the cabinet secretary held review meetings with chief secretaries of states. One night I called up Maharashtra chief secretary to send a tanker to Goa and he willingly sent it. Similarly, Karntaka themselves were in a serious state at one time, but when we requested them to spare tankers to Maharashtra and Telnagana, they happily did so. When we requested Kerala chief secretary to share some oxygen to Tamil Nadu, even when they were not getting their full quota, the state government gave some from its quota to Tamil Nadu. It was Indian in action and there was no Centre-state issue.How was the response of states like Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand since most of the medical oxygen was coming from these states?They were extremely supportive. Ultimately, everyone realizes that either we survive as a nation or we will all perish together – swim or sink together. All the states know about it.Was it a 24X7 operation for the empowered group during the crisis?Yes we were alert 24X7. In a day, there were 2,000-3,000 messages. There were more messages and alerts from Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Goa. We kept on receiving messages throughout the night. The entire logistics chain was throwing up issues - from behavior of plant manager to police stopping tankers, no availability of driver for another tanker, delay on parts of some states in sending back containers and need for arranging aircrafts to lift empty tankers. All members of the main group and sub-groups were available throughout. Home secretary and cabinet secretary were the last one to go to bed. I don’t think they even slept from April 21 to April 30. We were getting calls and messages from them at 12.30 am, 1.30am and even at 2.30 am.Had you ever dealt with such a crisis in your career?The scale of this crisis is much bigger. In 1989, I dealt with a major cyclone that hit a coastal district in Andhra Pradesh. I was very young and was posted as Tehsildar there. We had to undertake relief and rehabilitation work for 15 days. I did not sleep for 15 days. That time there was no mobile.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/it-was-india-in-action-during-o2-crisis-oxygen-empowered-group-convener/articleshow/83501632.cms,2

Overall, the countries most affected by the pandemic have not fared worse in wealth creation.However, the pandemic had a profound short-term impact on global markets in the first quarter of 2020 as $17.5 trillion was lost from total global household wealth between January and March of 2020, or a fall of 4.4 per cent. But this was reversed by end-June when share prices began to soar and reached record levels by year-end. Housing markets also benefited from the prevailing optimism.The net result was that $28.7 trillion was added to global household wealth during the year, taking the aggregate global wealth up by $28.7 trillion to $418.3 trillion, the report said.While North America added $12.4 trillion, $9.2 trillion was added in Europe, China gained $4.2 trillion and the Asia-Pacific region (excluding China and India) added another $4.7 trillion.Latin America was the worst performer, with total wealth loss of 11.4 per cent or $1.2 trillion, followed by India with a loss of 4.4 per cent.The report also projected a 39 per cent rise in global wealth by 2025 at $583 trillion, with the number of millionaires reaching 84 million.

Ambani’s group bought its first cargo of carbon-neutral crude oil in February and said it was looking for more such partnerships.The greenhouse gas emissions involved in the extraction, processing and shipping of such cargos have been offset by the crude oil suppliers.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/companies-must-go-green-to-survive-mukesh-ambani/articleshow/83736093.cms,0

The 200-bed children ward of Jamnagar’s biggest government hospital will be converted into a fully-fledged children’s hospital with 300 beds and the latest equipment and machinery for speedy diagnosis.The decision to upgrade the paediatric ward was taken as experts have expressed concerns over more children getting infected with cornavirus in the third wave. Jamnagar district collector Ravi Shankar said that the GG Hospital currently has 2,000 beds including the children’s ward, which is not designed for the needs of kids. “We will be installing the best possible medical equipment available in the world. Some machines and equipment are being imported from South Korea, USA and from across the globe. This new paediatric hospital will be a benchmark for other hospitals in the country,” Shankar told TOI. The funding for the hospital upgradation will be provided by the Reliance Foundation. The new hospital with children friendly infrastructure is expected to be ready within the next two-and-half months.“The hospital building will be made more children friendly. There will be special toilets and beds for a child’s comfort. It is difficult for a 3-4 year old kid to stay in the hospital without any one parent present. A special chair on which an adult can sleep will be installed near each bed,” said Shankar. Director of corporate affairs at Reliance Industries Ltd, Parimal Nathwani said, “We are planning for 50 ICU beds at the hospital. The infrastructure will be created inside the GG Hospital premises. The planning has started and we have also ordered the equipment.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/gg-hospitals-paediatric-ward-set-for-major-overhaul/articleshow/83725961.cms,2

RIL released its annual report for the fiscal year 2021 earlier this month. The report, among other things, talks about Jio accelerating rollout of digital platforms, indigenously-developed 5G stack and more. Speculations suggest that RIL chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani may announce new 5G phones from the company and the company's entry into laptops market. Here's what the rumours say will be announced and moreReliance-Jio Google phoneGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai recently said that the company continues to engage closely with partner Jio to build an affordable smartphone and that the work is underway on the project. In 2020, Google had picked up a 7.7 per cent stake in Jio Platforms for Rs 33,737 crore. It also entered into an agreement with Jio Platforms to develop an affordable smartphone.JioBook laptopsReliance Jio is reportedly planning to enter the laptop segment. It is said to be working on a product likely to be called the JioBook which will run a customized Android skin on top dubbed as the JioOS. This device will reportedly run on Qualcomm's 11-nm Snapdragon 665 chipset with 4G connectivity. Reliance Jio has reportedly partnered with China's Bluebank Communication Technology for the laptop. Bluebank has developed products that run KaiOS, the operating system that powers Jio's feature phone JioPhone.JioPhone 3JioPhone users may see an upgrade this year, after a gap of one year. There was no new variant of JioPhone in 2020. So, it is likely that we may see JioPhone 3 announcement by Mukesh Ambani at 2021 AGM. RIL in its annual report for the financial year ended March 31, 2021, said that the JioPhone since its unveiling in 2017, “upgraded over 100 million users.” The report also highlighted that the mobile data penetration has increased to 35% in rural areas as compared to 13% prior to the arrival of Jio in the marketspace.More on Desi 5G solutionsIn its annual report, RIL stressed on the Desi 5G solutions it is building. The AGM may see further announcements in this regard. These may include tentative rollout plan, partners and more.New JioFiber and Jio mobile plans Reliance Jio has been very aggressive of both its broadband and mobile plans. The company recently announced new Freedom plans which offer data with no daily usage limit. Late last year, it also launched new JioFiber plans which led to a tariff war in the industry. It's likely that we will see spme announcement on these fronts as well. According to the company's annual report, Reliance Jio has built sufficient network capacity for the next 300 million mobile broadband subscribers, over 50 million fibre homes and 50 million micro, small and medium businesses, it added. Qualcomm and Jio successfully tested 5G solutions in India, achieving the 1 Gbps milestone on Jio 5G solution, Mukesh Ambani said in the annual report.Dividend for the fiscal year 2021 The company had fixed June 14 as the record date for the purpose of determining the members eligible to receive dividend for the financial year 2020-21.

The company will “target to achieve costs that are lowest in the world to ensure affordability of our solar modules” and “enable at least 100 GW (gigawatt) of solar energy capacity by 2030, chairman Mukesh Ambani told shareholders.“As one of the biggest energy markets in the world, India will play a leading role in transforming the global energy landscape. In 2016, we launched Jio with the aim of bridging the Digital Divide in India. Now, in 2021, we are launching our new energy business with the aim of bridging the green energy divide in India and globally,” he said.83829982RIL’s solar plan takes on the combined might of companies such as Adani Solar, Vikram Solar, Waaree Energies and Tata Solar. It is more than six times bigger than the current domestic module manufacturing capacity of 15 GW and 14 times larger than 7 GW operational capacity that meets 35% of domestic demand.“Jamnagar was the cradle of our old energy business. Jamnagar will also be the cradle of our new business,” Ambani said referring to an integrated manufacturing facility, named Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex, being set up in the Gujarat district where the company built the world’s largest oil refining complex on 7,500 acres in 1999. The renewables complex will be set up on 5,000 acres and amongst the largest such integrated facilities in the world. It will house four ‘giga factories' for producing solar photovoltaic (PV) modules from scratch, advanced batteries for solar storage projects, electrolyser plant for green hydrogen and fuel cells for hydrogen vehicles.These facilities envisage an investment of Rs 60,000 crore. An additional Rs 15,000 crore will be invested into creating utilities, ancillary units and partnerships for creating a new energy eco-system. Two verticals will be set up for providing end-to-end renewable project management solution and financing.RIL appears to be targeting the gap in India’s solar manufacturing capability, while it chases a target of 175 GW by 2022 based on imported equipment. The timing of the plan coincides with the government’s Rs 4,500 crore production linked incentive to encourage domestic manufacturing.The green hydrogen and fuel cell units will prepare the conglomerate for a market for new-age mobility solutions such as hydrogen vehicles lurking on the horizon, as envisaged in the budget 2021 national hydrogen mission.

Market reports suggest tha","NEW DELHI: Google JioNext smartphone is here. Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani announced the 'JioPhone Next' smartphone, jointly developed by Jio and Google, at the company's 44th annual general meeting (AGM). Ambani said that an ultra-affordable 4G smartphone is essential to make India '2G-mukt' (free of 2G). The country still has nearly 300 million mobile users who are unable to escape from inefficient and exorbitant 2G services since most basic 4G smartphone remain unaffordable for users, he added. ""While millions of people across India who use feature phones want access to a full-fledged smartphone, there exists gaps in usability and affordability that prevent these aspirations from becoming reality,"" said Google in a blog post. Google and Jio first announced they are working together on an affordable smartphone in 2020, when Google invested $4.5 million in Jio Platforms. While Ambani called JioPhone Next as the 'most-affordable' smartphone launched so far, he did not reveal its exact pricing. Market reports suggest that the smartphone may be priced around Rs 5,000, making it one of the most-affordable Android phone. But will the JioPhone Next be threat to budget phones from the likes of Xiaomi, Realme, Samsung and others? Here are reasons why it may not be a straight challenge to these brands in the smartphone market, but may actually expand the pie. Yes it may pull away some users from these brands but how much depends on pricing and specs.No smartphone from Xiaomi, Realme and Samsung under Rs 5,000These are the companies that offer entry-level smartphones. However, other than Tecno, none of these companies have launched a smartphone under Rs 5,000 in the recent months. One of the top-selling Xiaomi phones Redmi 9A is priced at Rs 6,799 for the 2GB/32GB model. Arch-rival Realme too offers no smartphone under Rs 5,000. The C-series is the company's entry-level series and the cheapest phone right now in the series on the company's website is Realme C20, priced at Rs 6,799. It's no different for Samsung. The company's most-affordable smartphone series, M-series, too offers no device under Rs 5,000. The likely reason is that these companies target budget smartphone buyers rather than feature phone users. Now it remains to be seen if Reliance Jio will be able to get a part of this user base as well.  83811508How will the Android OS powering Reliance Jio phone be different""JioPhoneNext is powered by an extremely optimised version of the Android Operating System, that has been jointly developed by Jio and Google, especially for the Indian market,"" said Ambani while talking about the OS of the JioPhone Next. Other than this the company gave no other details of the OS. So, while it is not clear what exactly this OS will be it is likely that it may be something similar to Google's Android Go platform. Android Go is a version of the OS designed for ultra-cheap smartphones. This stripped down version of Android is optimised to work on phones with less than 2GB RAM and comes pre-loaded with a special suite of Google apps that are designed to use less bandwidth and have a smaller memory footprint. Aims to solve language barrier and literacy barrier with voice-first featuresJioPhone Next is clearly targeted at first-time smartphone buyers and those looking to upgrade from feature phones. Many of these users face language and literacy barrier. ""We have worked closely with the Jio team on engineering and product development on useful voice-first features that enable these users to consume content and navigate the phone in their own language, deliver a great camera experience, and get the latest Android feature and security updates,"" said Google in its blog post. This means that users will be able to use their voice to control the device. ""For users who might not be able to read content in their language, with a tap of a button they can now translate what’s on their screen, and even have it read back to them in their own language. Read Aloud and Translate Now are seamlessly integrated in the OS allowing these features to work with any text on their phone screen, including web pages, apps, messages, and even photos. We’ve also added App Actions that enable Google Assistant to deliver a great experience with many of the Jio apps on this device. In addition to asking for the latest cricket scores or a weather update, you can also ask Google Assistant to play music on Jio Saavn or check your balance on My Jio,"" adds Google's post.Access to latest Android updates, not many budget phones get thatOne big advantage that JioPhone Next will be that it comes with the promise of the support for the latest Android releases and security updates, all delivered over-the-air. The phone also comes with Google Play Protect built in. 83811515Basic hardware may pose a challengeWhile Reliance has not revealed the hardware features of the phone. From the looks, they seem to be basic. From the pictures shared, JioPhone Next seems to feature chunky bezels around the display, plain plastic back and a single camera. The design appears to be similar to Android smartphones from 2012. The JioPhone Next will come with the Google Camera Go app pre-installed, which will enable features like Night Mode, HDR enhance and Snapchat AR filters. Google has partnered with Snap to integrate Indian-specific Snapchat Lenses directly into the phone's camera.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/google-jionext-smartphone-challenges-budget-android-smartphones-what-we-know-so-far/articleshow/83811484.cms,2

The energy transition will allow RIL to participate in India's energy consumption growth story over a longer horizon,"" it said.Ambani expects to conclude the sale of a 20 per cent stake in O2C business to Saudi Aramco this year but the extent of upfront cash component in the transaction will determine the extent of the benefit to RIL, brokerages said, adding an all-cash transaction will also reduce RIL's carbon footprint.""RIL's AGM focused on the next hypergrowth opportunity in cleantech and its path to decarbonisation. The 'mega' plan is unique in a global context in multiple ways, has potential to spur re-rating, raises clarity on the investment cycle, and reduces investor worry about holdco discount,"" Morgan Stanley said.Its decarbonisation plan involves capturing the hypergrowth market of manufacturing solar cells, electrolysers, and fuel cells, while steadily pivoting its energy operations to green hydrogen, carbon fibre, e-fuels, and green chemicals.""The single location energy complex will be key to this plan and supports hyper-integration of the supply chain, utilities, and end energy use. ""The plan also helps diversify the revenue stream from India-centric consumer and chemicals businesses to international opportunities, via exports of hardware for energy transition as well as hydrogen,"" it said.Kotak Securities said RIL's plans for the new energy and new materials business may be initially focused on integrated manufacturing of solar photovoltaic modules, while the investments in other parts of the value chain may likely be back-ended.The company may benefit from the recent policy initiatives by the government to encourage domestic manufacturing of solar equipment, which is otherwise imported in large proportion currently.These initiatives include customs duty of 25 per cent and 40 per cent on imports of solar PV cells and solar PV modules to be imposed from April 1, 2022, Rs 4,500 crore of payments under the production-linked incentive scheme for National Programme on High-Efficiency Solar PV Modules, and access of cheap electricity, term loans, and working capital financing.""These incentives will meaningfully improve the economics for domestic players, who currently grapple with 10 per cent higher operating costs and sub-scale inefficient capacity compared to the Chinese counterparts,"" it said.It estimated that 1 GW of an integrated solar module capacity may require Rs 3,500-4,000 crore of investments and RIL's target to enable 100+ GW of solar energy generation by 2030 may require it to set up a solar module capacity of 10-15 GW.Citi said the announcements on clean energy are prima facie promising and should help pivot the company towards a low carbon future, though details are limited and paybacks uncertain.BofA said while a good decision from a long-term perspective, the capex investments, coupled with investment in 5G, will likely push RIL away from its recently achieved zero net-debt position to slight debt position.HSBC said RIL should benefit from the Performance Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes that the government is rolling out for PV manufacturing and advanced energy storage plants.The government has already come up with a PLI scheme for advanced chemistry cell battery manufacturing (Rs 18,000 crore) for setting up 50GWH capacity in the country for EV and grid storage usages. Any player can bid for 5GWH to 20GWH capacity in this scheme.Also, a PLI scheme for solar modules manufacturing (Rs 4500 crore) for 10GW capacity has been announced. Players have to bid for at least 1GW capacity.Stating that in the run-up to the AGM, the market had expected more details on the Jio phone launch and progress on the Aramco deal, HSBC said Ambani did talk about the Jio phone being ""ultra-affordable"" but did not give out pricing and specifications.Goldman Sachs said the company's comments make it believe that competition in India's internet space, especially e-commerce, will increase in the short-to-medium term.Comments around JioMart suggest strong traction and increases the confidence of the firm reaching a turnover of USD 19 billion, or 50 per cent share of online grocery, by FY25.Credit Suisse said the total addressable market (TAM) for Jio's smartphone would be 150 million of the 400 million current feature users (including JioPhones).",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/clean-tech-next-hypergrowth-opportunity-for-reliance-say-brokerages/articleshow/83844508.cms,0

This will include solar manufacturing facility, battery factory, fuel cell-making factory and an electrolyzer unit.It will be amongst the largest such integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world, Ambani said while adding, “Jamnagar was the cradle of our old business strategy. Jamnagar will also be the cradle of our new business strategy.”Over the next three years, RIL plans to invest over Rs 60,000 crore in renewable energy business in the next three years which includes setting up four giga factories near Jamnagar.Ambani said his oil-to-telecom conglomerate will invest another Rs 15,000 crore to provide infrastructure and utilities to manufacturing ancillary materials and equipment needed to support the four Giga factories.The company will also build a facility for the production of solar energy where RIL will build an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory. Another factory will be for the storage battery while the third facility will be for production of green hydrogen that can be used as a fuel in automobiles. The fourth will be a fuel cell factory for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power, according to Ambani.For FY 2021 RIL’s consolidated total revenues were Rs 5,39,238 crore. Around 60% of the total revenues for this period came from O2C (oil to chemicals) segment, a strategy adapted by the company two years ago for Jamnagar, said sources in the know of the matter.The company’ Jamnagar complex will provide infrastructure and utilities to manufacture ancillary material and equipment needed to support these Giga factories so that all critical materials are available in time.RIL will invest an additional Rs 15,000 crore in value chain, partnerships and future technologies, including upstream and downstream industries. “Thus, our overall initial investment from our own internal resources in the New Energy business will be Rs 75,000 crore in 3 years,"" said Ambani. The company had last year set a target of becoming a net-zero carbon company by 2035, a shorter time frame compared to the 2050 cutoff self-imposed by many of its global peers, including BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.In lines with Prime Minister Narendra Modi ambitious target to achieve 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, RIL said it will establish and enable at least 100GW of solar energy by 2030. “With these new initiatives, Reliance will put Gujarat and India on the world solar and hydrogen map,"" he said.

This will be RIL’s first investment in a greenfield petchem project abroad. In 2012, it had bought BP’s petchem plant in Malaysia for $230 million. The petchem plant in Abu Dhabi’s Al Ruwais city will produce chlor-alkali, ethylene dichloride and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Chlor-alkali is used in water treatment and in the manufacture of textiles and metals. Ethylene dichloride is used to produce PVC, which has a wide range of applications across housing, infrastructure and consumer goods. Commenting on the Abu Dhabi petchem project, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said, “This is a significant step in globalising Reliance’s operations, and we are proud to partner with ADNOC in this important project for the region.” RIL and Abu Dhabi have a long relationship, with the former sourcing crude oil from the emirate for many years. Abu Dhabi had also recently invested in RIL’s retail and telecom (Jio) businesses. In 2019, the two had signed a framework to explore joint investments in petchem. RIL’s investment in the Abu Dhabi petchem plant will be finalised when EPC contracts are awarded next year. The petchem plant has been initiated based on the demand potential for these products. “The market for chemicals is expected to enjoy steady growth supported by the needs of growing demand, particularly in Asia and Africa,” RIL said. This will be RIL’s first major investment in the Middle East, according to ADNOC. The Abu Dhabi plant will have a capacity to produce 9.4 lakh tons of chlor-alkali annually, 1.1 million tons of ethylene dichloride and 3.6 lakh tons of PVC.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-ties-up-with-adnoc-for-petchem-plant-in-uae/articleshow/83967503.cms,0

The two entities were incorporated a little over a fortnight before RIL unveiled its green energy plans at its annual shareholder meet on June 24. In February this year, Anant, 26, was inducted as a director of Reliance O2C, where Saudi Aramco is expected to be an investor, and a year before that, he was appointed on the board of Jio Platforms, where his siblings Isha and Akash too are members. RIL didn’t respond to a questionnaire from TOI. While Mukesh Ambani, 64, hasn’t yet spelt out succession planning at RIL, questions like ‘who’s next?’ have started popping up within the investor community. In Ambani’s own case, after the death of his father, RIL founder Dhirubhai Ambani, in 2002, there was a feud over succession between him and his brother Anil.  84131021Dhirubhai had not left a will and the family business had to be split, with Mukesh gaining RIL (oil refining and petrochemicals) and Anil getting the energy, finance and telecom units as part of the settlement.Besides Jio Platforms, Isha and Akash, the 29-year-old twins, are on the board of Reliance Retail Ventures. Both Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail Ventures had attracted billions of dollars in investments and brought on board global names such as Google, Facebook, Silver Lake and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to help expand their digital and e-commerce footprint. With Anant’s latest board appointments, all the three children now have representation in RIL’s key businesses. After the recent separation of the refining and petrochemicals unit to Reliance O2C, RIL looks similar to Tata Sons, the holding company of Tata Group’s diverse businesses. RIL is also paving the way for initial public offerings of Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail Ventures, which are expected to take place in the near future. Apart from Reliance New Energy Solar and Reliance New Solar Energy, RIL incorporated five other entities since June — Reliance New Energy Storage, Reliance Solar Projects, Reliance Storage, Reliance New Energy Carbon Fibre and Reliance New Energy Hydrogen Electrolysis. Their names indicate that the entities were established for the clean energy game.All the seven companies have three directors each. A common director in all these entities is Shanker Natarajan.At the annual shareholder meeting last month, Ambani said that RIL will invest Rs 75,000 crore in clean energy over three years, but details about how it intends to execute the green play have not been disclosed. RIL’s renewable power move comes more than a decade after Mukesh and Anil cancelled all non-compete business agreements between them.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/youngest-ambani-takes-seat-on-boards-of-rils-2-new-solar-cos/articleshow/84125501.cms,2

It has sharpened its focus on renewables amid the industry shifting from the highly polluting coal-fired electricity generation to green energy resources such as solar and wind. The renewables sector will also see increased competition with Reliance Industries set to throw its hat in the ring. “From a growth perspective, the company has a clear plan with focus on renewables and distribution businesses,” said Chandrasekaran. “We have no plans to expand in (coal-fired) thermal power. Thermal will be only for sustenance capex. The capex will be towards renewables and distribution—both for sustenance and for growth.” Prayagraj Power was the last thermal asset the company had bought in 2019. Tata Power hopes to have 60% of its electricity generation from renewables by 2025 and about 90% by 2030. The company is focusing on building scale in consumer renewables, that is, in rooftop solar, solar pumps, electric vehicle charging systems and home automation. “We are witnessing strong growth in rooftop solar and solar pumps. Both can easily grow close to billion-dollar in five years.”In the distribution business, Tata Power currently supplies electricity across Mumbai, Delhi, Ajmer and Odisha (it recently acquired the distribution license for the eastern state). As and when more electricity distribution companies are privatised, Tata Power will participate in those as the company has strong skill sets in this area as well as a lot of operational experience, said Chandrasekaran. “The company can be a strong player in distribution. It is a profitable business but in the initial years, the company will have to make investments.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-plans-to-expand-in-thermal-tata-power-chairman-n-chandrasekaran/articleshow/84162739.cms,0

He said his group would spend $10 billion over the next three years in building solar manufacturing units, a battery factory for energy storage, a fuel cell factory, and a unit to produce green hydrogen.Three days later, Adani announced that his green energy venture would add 5 GW every year this decade, from a current level of about 3.5 GW.Analysts say there is sufficient space for multiple companies to grow as a part of India's ambitious green energy target, but tariffs could fall further as companies try to outdo each other in aggressive bidding wars to win projects.Solar tariffs are already among the lowest in the world, having fallen below Rs 2 ($0.0269) per kilowatt hour in auctions conducted in Gujarat.""I would expect by 2030 that they (solar tariffs) will probably touch 1 rupee per kilowatt hour,"" said Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies at the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.Reliance has a track record of disrupting rival businesses. With cheap smartphones and data plans, its telecom venture Jio has in five years dethroned market leaders Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel to become the largest telecom operator in India.Coal and power may decline Both Ambani and Adani have built businesses based on fossil fuels. Reliance runs the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat while Adani is India's largest private sector operator of coal-fired thermal stations and the country's largest coal trader.India is the world's third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. Coal-based power generation could drop dramatically as the major players go green, analysts say.Rishab Shrestha, senior analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie said he expects India's coal generation share to drop to 50% in early 2030s from over 70% currently.""We expect cost of building new coal plants in India to be $62/MWh by 2030, 25% higher than that of solar,"" Shrestha said.Adani has not announced plans to build any new thermal power plants, and his companies are unlikely to be affected by relatively higher costs of coal-fired power.Both groups are trying to improve their clean energy credentials as investors pay more attention to the environmental impact of their businesses and make decisions based on ESG ratings, analysts say.One of Adani's main businesses, Adani Green Energy, currently dominates India's renewables space. Its shares have soared over 156% in the past year.Ambani wants Reliance to become net carbon zero by 2035, much ahead of 2050 target of global oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP.""Reliance will emerge as the most credible renewables player in the country in the next two years. Its ESG scores will also improve, meaningfully attracting money from ESG funds globally,"" Jefferies said in a note.If both companies hit their targets, Reliance's targeted solar capacity of 100 GW will be twice as large as Adani's, and the companies would together account for a third of all of India's 2030 target.Adani, who has faced criticism for developing a coal mine in Australia and doing business with entities a rights group says are linked to the Myanmar armed forces, needs to do more to attain better sustainability scores, Buckley said.The Adani group has denied links to the Myanmar military, and said it could write down an investment in a port terminal in Myanmar. It has said the Australian coal mine created jobs for the locals, and was critical to ensuring energy security.""Financial markets are not agnostic to ESG, so he has to walk the talk,"" Buckley said.

As they sought alternatives, some turned to technology and automation to bridge the gap.83736093For Tarun Kumar Mishra, co-founder of Detect Technologies Pvt Ltd, it was the perfect opportunity for his product: a real-time pipeline monitoring system that tracks leaks and corrosion using sensors and artificial intelligence. In 2014, tycoon Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd made a rare $100,000 investment in Mishra, which helped fund the initiative.“Technology adoption increased substantially,” Mishra said. “The Covid-19 outbreak forced everyone to break the inertia of working with a certain process that’s been in place for 50 to 60 years. They either had to shut down the plant or try a new way.”Forcing changeWith the funds, the 32-year-old Mishra said he roped in students who joined him with only food as an incentive. The company has since built another product utilizing drones programmed to inspect sites and equipment including refineries, power plants and reactors.The startup then won a contract from Royal Dutch Shell Plc in 2019 to monitor a petrochemicals plant in Pennsylvania and now counts companies including Reliance and Bharat Petroleum Corp in India, as well as global energy majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp as customers.“We are benefiting from their drone-based monitoring of our plants and inspection of our tanks,” said Arun Kumar Singh, director of marketing and refineries at Bharat Petroleum. “That’s become all the more relevant right now as we are operating with a lesser number of people to avoid exposure.”83806690Detect is also working with Adani Transmission Ltd, which supplies electricity to Mumbai, to avoid a repeat of a grid collapse last year that contributed to its worst blackout in decades.

The report published on July 15 states that the company’s new energy business strategy can contribute almost 10% of the company’s total EBITDA by FY26 if all goes as planned. The report ‘Green machine. How much is the new energy worth?’ says that RIL’s strategy is analogous to the ‘pick shovels over mines’ approach. “Many oil companies have tried and failed to become clean energy manufacturing companies and instead focus on clean energy production. RIL focus on manufacturing is distinctive and potentially offers higher margins but is also higher risk given their limited capabilities in clean energy,” it says.RIL will need to find partners to work with them given the technology requirements needed for fuel cells and batteries.Last month, RIL announced its plan to spend Rs 75,000 crore over the next few years for the new energy business. It will spend Rs 60,000 crore to construct four “giga factories” to make integrated solar PV modules, electrolyzers, fuel cells and batteries to store energy from the grid. The site of these plants will be located at the new 5,000 acres Green Energy Giga Complex in Jamnagar. For solar, RIL is planning to enter the solar manufacturing and generation with a target of 100GW of solar energy by 2030.From oil and gas to telecom, to retail & internet, it's hard to think of another company which has re-invented itself as much as RIL has done over the past decade, the report states while calling it a bold move.While it is unclear as to whether RIL will be successful, it is too early to discount them given their track record of successfully disrupting other industries, such as telecom and retail, it adds.Many integrated oil and gas companies have announced plans to invest in solar, wind or hydrogen production as they transition their portfolios away from fossil fuels and towards low carbon energy.“But what is unique about RIL’s strategy is that they are focusing on the equipment required to produce clean energy rather than clean energy production itself. For example, RIL will be manufacturing solar PV panels and energy storage equipment (batteries), rather than investing in solar power,” it said.Here comes the sunThe logic of investing in clean energy is compelling as $70 trillion are likely be spent globally on the energy transition over the next 30 years, according to the report. While India has yet to declare a net zero target, the direction towards low carbon is clear. With solar becoming cheaper than coal and hydrogen reaching cost parity with diesel, there are clear economic and energy security reasons to believe that India will transition towards clean energy.

We are committed to comply with the laws of India and will extend full cooperation to the CCI on this matter,"" an Amazon spokesperson said on Thursday.The spokesperson exuded confidence that the company will be able to address the CCI's concerns.""However, as our dispute with Future is pending litigation, and we are also bound by confidentiality obligations, we are unable to comment on the merits or substance of any allegations at this stage...,"" the spokesperson said.There were no immediate comments from Future Group.On Thursday, Future Group submitted a copy of CCI's notice to Amazon to the Supreme Court, which is hearing a plea filed by Amazon related to the ongoing dispute.In November 2019, CCI had given its approval for Amazon to acquire a 49 per cent stake in Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCL). FCL is a shareholder in Future Retail Ltd.CCI had sent the notice to Amazon on June 4. The notice pertains to Amazon's submissions while seeking a nod for the FCL deal, the sources said.Deals beyond a certain threshold require approval from CCI. The watchdog has wide powers, including to revoke its clearance for any transaction if it is found at any time that the information provided by the acquirer was incorrect.In the notice, CCI has alleged Amazon of concealing its strategic interest over Future Retail and that such interest was not disclosed to the regulator previously.Apart from non-disclosure, false and incorrect representations have also been made in relation to the 2019 transaction, according to the notice, a copy of which was seen by PTI.""... you are being issued this show cause notice to explain, in writing, as to why you shall not be found to have -- failed to give notice in respect of FRL SHA (Future Retail Ltd Shareholding Agreement) and furnished false and incorrect information and concealed/ suppressed material facts, in contravention of the said provisions of the (Competition) Act,"" it said.In August 2019, Amazon had agreed to purchase 49 per cent of one of Future's unlisted firms, FCL (which owns 7.3 per cent equity in BSE-listed Future Retail Ltd through convertible warrants), with the right to buy into the flagship Future Retail after a period of three to 10 years.A year later, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd had entered into a pact with Future Group to acquire the retail and wholesale business and the logistics and warehousing business for Rs 24,713 crore.Amazon dragged Future Group into arbitration at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), arguing that its 2019 deal prevents the selling of Future Retail Ltd business to rivals. In October last year, an interim award was passed by the Emergency Arbitrator (EA) in favour of the US-e-commerce major.The EA barred Future Retail from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party. Amazon and Future Group have also filed litigations in Indian courts, including the Supreme Court, on the issue.The SIAC has concluded its hearing on the plea filed by Amazon in the matter and is likely to pronounce a judgement in a month.The Future Group-Reliance deal was initially expected to close by March-end. However, in April, Reliance Industries said it was extending the timeline for the ""Long Stop Date"" from March 31, 2021, to September 30, 2021.The deal has received clearance from regulators such as CCI, Sebi and bourses, and the scheme of arrangement is now awaiting a nod from the NCLT and shareholders.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cci-issues-notice-to-amazon-seeks-explanation-on-fcl-deal-submissions-made-in-2019/articleshow/84655259.cms,2

It also noted that its review of the submissions made had been prompted by a complaint from Future Group.In the four-page letter, a so-called 'show cause notice', the CCI asked Amazon why it should not take action and penalise the company for providing false information.Amazon has yet to respond, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified as the letter has not been made public.Amazon said in a statement to Reuters it had received a letter, was committed to complying with India's laws and would extend its full cooperation to the CCI.""We are confident that we will be able to address the CCI’s concerns,"" it said.Representatives for Future and the CCI did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.Vaibhav Choukse, a competition law specialist and partner at J Sagar Associates, said it was rare for the CCI to issue such a notice and that if the CCI was not satisfied by Amazon's response, it could lead to a fine and even a review of the deal.""The CCI has wide powers which includes directions to re-file the approval application and even revoke the approval under exceptional circumstances,"" Choukse said.The CCI's 2019 approval order states its decision ""shall stand revoked if, at any time, the information provided"" is found to be incorrect.Submissions comparedThe dispute over Future Retail, which has more than 1,500 supermarket and other outlets, is the most hostile flashpoint between Jeff Bezos' Amazon and Reliance, run by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, as they try to gain the upper hand in winning over the country's consumers.Amazon also has a host of other challenges in India, a key growth market where it has committed $6.5 billion in investments, including a separate CCI probe into alleged practices that small businesses say have hurt them.In addition, it faces the prospect of more regulations that would restrict the sale of private labels and would prohibit the U.S. firm from allowing its affiliates to list products on its website.The CCI letter compared three sets of submissions Amazon made to it in 2019 with submissions made later to other legal forums, saying they were ""contradictory.""In particular, it said Amazon had explained its interest in investing in Future's coupon unit as one that would address gaps in India's payments industry. But the letter stated Amazon had disclosed in other legal forums that the foundation of its relationship with Future Coupon was certain special rights it obtained over Future Retail.""Amazon has concealed its strategic interest"" in Future Retail, the letter said, adding: ""Such interest and the purpose of the combination ... was not disclosed to the Commission despite specific requirements.""The CCI also objected to one section of a submission where Amazon had told the regulator it had nothing to do with one particular legal agreement that two Future entities had signed between themselves days ahead of its 2019 deal. But Amazon later claimed before an arbitrator that the agreement was an ""integrated part"" of the transaction, the letter said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/antitrust-regulator-cci-accuses-amazon-of-concealing-facts-in-deal-for-future-group-unit/articleshow/84638500.cms,1

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s retail-to-refining empire had more than 236,300 employees as of March 31.Coronavirus: Live updatesReliance joins the local unit of consumer giant Unilever, which has given at least one shot to about 90% of its employees, or more than 88,000 people, and technology firms Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys Ltd., which have inoculated 70% and 59% of their workforces respectively.The ability of private companies to source and administer shots shows the disparity developing in India, where the organized sector accounts for less than 20% of the workforce. India has administered at least one dose to just 25% of its 1.3 billion population, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker, versus more than 50% in China and the US.Meanwhile, some states continue to struggle with sporadic vaccine shortages, blunting India’s overall efforts to avert a virus resurgence. India’s second wave of a few months ago, driven by the delta variant first identified there, overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums, highlighting the urgent need for vaccine supplies to be boosted in the country and to the wider developing world, where the lack of access to shots is a growing concern.Breaking pointIndia has for months struggled to ramp up its immunization campaign and has relied on the private sector to ease the burden on public health-care facilities, which were stretched to breaking point in the wave of infections that peaked in May.At its current rate of vaccination, India is projected to take 1.1 years to inoculate 75% of its population with two doses, according to Bloomberg’s tracker. That puts it well behind many developed countries, and some emerging economies, like China, Malaysia and Cambodia, as well.Still, the Serum Institute of India Ltd, the world’s biggest vaccine producer, has slowly boosted average monthly output to more than 100 million doses of the AstraZeneca Plc shot they’re contracted to make, while India’s other main supplier -- Bharat Biotech International Ltd -- is churning out about 25 million doses of its Covaxin vaccine each month, Bharati Pravin Pawar, the country’s junior health minister, said last week.While the central government has denied any vaccine supply gaps, as many as 3 million people in the north-western state of Rajasthan missed their second dose due to a lack of supplies.

The company expects the facility to become operational in the second half of 2023, creating 1,000 jobs in the country. The India expansion is part of the company’s plan to double its manufacturing capacity to 16 GW by 2024 and make it the largest module manufacturer in India.This is the second announcement of a GW-size domestic solar module making plan following the government’s PLI (performance-linked incentive) scheme for promoting domestic manufacturing. Reliance Industries Ltd had recently announced a $10 billion green energy plan that included setting up giga-size integrated module-making facility.Industry analysts said these announcements could prompt Chinese module manufacturers, who dominate the Indian market, to consider manufacturing in India in view of its ambition of creating 450 GW renewable energy capacity by 2030.The company said the facility would have the advanced manufacturing technology established for its recently-announced facility in Ohio.“India is an attractive market for First Solar not simply because our module technology is advantaged in its hot, humid climate. It is an inherently sustainable market, underpinned by a growing economy and appetite for energy, with a well-defined goal that will need over 25 GW of solar to be deployed annually for the next nine years,” according to company CEO Mark Widmar.“Crucially, it has combined its clean energy targets with effective trade and industrial policy designed to enable self-sufficient domestic manufacturing and true energy security. We also have many long-standing consumers in the country that will be pleased to have access to an advanced photovoltaic module, which is made in India, for India,” Widmar added.The company has so far supplied nearly 2 GW solar modules to projects in India, which is its second-largest market after North America.

The scope of this joint venture, IndianOil Petronas Pvt Ltd (IPPL), is now being expanded to include fuel and natural gas marketing.For one, IPPL will not be governed by the tedious petrol pump allotment rules that require public sector oil marketing companies to appoint dealers through a draw of a lottery. The joint venture can choose a site and operator quickly and on commercial terms.""We have all options open - IPPL can set up new retail outlets, it can set up wayside amenities (at petrol pumps on National Highways) and we can also monetise some of our existing retail outlets by selling them to the joint venture,"" Gupta said at an investor call.IPPL can set up petrol pumps that will not just sell petrol and diesel but also have EV charging and battery swapping points as well as CNG/LPG and LNG dispensing stations.This will be roughly on lines of the outlets that Reliance Industries and its partner BP Plc of UK are setting up.Gupta said fuel marketing business is opening up that requires agility in operations.State-owned fuel retailers such as IOC have to allot dealerships through a lottery of all eligible candidates. It does not allow discretion.Also, wayside amenities such as food court can be set up with IPPL, he said.IPPL currently sells LPG to commercial customers who are not allowed to use subsidised cooking gas sold to households by state energy firms.IOC owns 32,303 out of 77,709 petrol pumps in the country. It also has licences to retail CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households in several geographical areas.Last week, IOC Chairman S M Vaidya had said that IPPL will have its own branding and marketing.Asked if IPPL's foray in retailing will not cannibalise on IOC's business, he had said India's energy demand is growing and will have space for all players.""Energy pie is increasing. There is a place for everybody,"" he said. ""Our (IOC's) market share is intact and IPPL will capture new opportunities.""IPPL will be the 7th fuel retailer in the country. Besides IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) are the other two public sector fuel retailers.Reliance Industries and BP have a joint venture, Reliance BP Mobility Ltd which operates 1,422 petrol pumps in the country. Rosneft-promoted Nayara Energy is the biggest private player with 6,152 petrol pumps while Shell has 270 outlets.BPCL owns 18,766 petrol pumps while HPCL has 18,776.

India also does not have lithium reserves, the majority of which are controlled by China globally.This makes EVs a hard sell in a country like India where per capita income is around $2,000, or about 5% of that in Europe and Japan, and 95% of cars sold are priced below $20,000, Maruti Chairman RC Bhargava told shareholders in the company's annual report.""We need to recognise that our strategy for moving towards net zero emission has to be consistent with the economic and infrastructure conditions prevailing in the country,"" Bhargava said.To reduce fuel consumption and emissions, Maruti is pushing sales of cars that operate on compressed natural gas (CNG), and is also investing in hybrid technology, he said, adding that ""the use of hydrogen is also an interesting alternative"".Suzuki Motor Corp, which controls Maruti, is also prioritising development of clean technologies suitable for the Indian market, Bhargava said, adding that Suzuki's alliance with Toyota Motor Corp in Japan would prove valuable for this effort.Bhargava's comments come as debate around EVs is gathering steam in India, with Tesla Inc lobbying the government to lower import duties on electric cars.Tesla's demands have polarised India's auto industry, with South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co - which has a share of about 18% of the country's car market and is Maruti's closest competitor - supporting a tax cut on imports.Maruti's comments in support of hydrogen also come weeks after Mukesh Ambani, chairman of refiner Reliance Industries , said it would invest $10 billion in clean energy, including setting up giga factories to produce fuel cells and green hydrogen.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/cars/maruti-suzuki-sees-hydrogen-as-interesting-alternative/articleshow/84999232.cms,1

Reliance, which is backed by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, could reach an agreement with Aramco as soon as the coming weeks, the people said.Shares in Reliance extended gains to as much as 2.6% in Mumbai after the Bloomberg News report.A deal would forge a closer alliance between the world’s biggest oil exporter and one of the fastest-growing consumers. Ties and trade between the two countries have grown in recent years as India looks to bolster its energy security and Saudi Arabia reduces its support for Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir. Riyadh and New Delhi elevated their relationship to a “strategic partnership” in 2019.It would seal more than two years of negotiations and mark Aramco’s first all-stock deal since its initial public offering in 2019. Ambani confirmed talks about a deal with an implied stake valuation of $15 billion that same year. Discussions were delayed by the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and slump in oil prices.Energy markets have since recovered, with crude prices jumping around 35% this year to almost $70 a barrel. Aramco said last week due diligence on a deal with Reliance was underway.A transaction would boost Aramco’s sales of crude to India. For Reliance, it would help to lock in a steady supply of oil for its giant refineries and make the Indian company a shareholder in Aramco. Based on Aramco’s market valuation of about $1.9 trillion, a transaction would give Reliance a stake of around 1%.Details of the potential transaction are still being negotiated, and talks could drag on longer or fall apart, the people said. A representative for Aramco declined to comment. The Saudi government’s Center for International Communication didn’t immediately respond to an email requesting comment.Saudi goalsA representative for Reliance said the company does not have anything to add beyond Ambani’s comments at the shareholders’ meeting in June, when the conglomerate appointed Aramco Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan to the board. Ambani had said Reliance could finalise an investment deal with the oil producer this year.The Saudi government sold 2% of Aramco in the IPO, raising almost $30 billion. It’s still the largest first-time share sale on record.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler, said in April that the kingdom was in talks to sell a 1% stake in Aramco to a “leading global energy company.” He didn’t disclose which one.“This deal could be very important in strengthening Aramco’s sales in the country where this company resides,” the prince had said.Saudi Arabia shipped 613,000 barrels a day of crude to India in July, around 10% of its total exports.The transaction would help Aramco reach its goal of more than doubling refining capacity to between 8 million and 10 million barrels of crude a day. The Saudi firm had 3.6 million barrels a day of capacity at the end of last year, including stakes in joint ventures.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/saudi-aramco-in-advanced-talks-on-up-to-25-billion-reliance-deal/articleshow/85380315.cms,0

Investments will automatically follow. India can be a large producer, if not the largest, of green hydrogen,” power and renewable energy minister R K Singh told TOI last week.Green hydrogen is expected to emerge as a $12-13 trillion global industry by 2050. ACME Solar group chairman Manoj K Upadhyay reckons PM’s initiative can help industry build a domestic green hydrogen ecosystem worth $2-3 trillion in 20-25 years.Industry has been on a green hydrogen drive since the intent of a hydrogen mission was announced n Budget 2021. Reliance Industries Ltd, Indian Oil, JSW Energy and NTPC have already announced green hydrogen forays. NTPC has floated a tender for hydrogen blending of CNG. Currently all hydrogen consumed in India is extracted from fossil fuels, which emit CO2.Akshat Jain of legal firm J Sagar Associates said the green hydrogen provision in the draft rules indicate focus on increasing hydrogen generation capacity with the aim of making India a global hub. “With climate change as the centre of attention and COP 26 slated for November, policies around green hydrogen production, use and export are bound to gather momentum.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/industry-can-buy-green-hydrogen-to-meet-renewable-obligation/articleshow/85380251.cms,2

The only others are Reliance Industries, TCS and HDFC Bank, with m-caps of $186 billion, $180 billion and $116 billion, respectively.The milestone was achieved in morning trade on Tuesday when Infosys shares touched a year high of Rs 1,755 on the BSE. This took the m-cap to $100.7 billion. The stock closed at Rs 1,720, down 1%. On the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) too, Infosys’s m-cap was close to $100 billion in morning trade.While Infosys took 20 years to reach $50 billion in m-cap, the next $50 billion took just over a year, an astonishing growth rate under its CEO Salil Parekh. 85615840 IT companies are seeing a smart recovery from the pandemic, thanks to their clients’ desire for digital transformation through cloud and increased focus on data and analytics.Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai said, “In 1994, Infosys had a valuation of $100 million. In 27 years, it has crossed $100 billion, and it’s a great story. Infosys’s rise reflects the rise of India after liberalisation and the rise of the global IT services industry. It should have come earlier, except for the disruption caused in the firm.”Marti G Subrahmanyam, who is the Charles E Merrill professor of finance, economics and international business in the Stern School of Business at New York University, and who was on the board of Infosys from 1998 to 2011, recollects that when he joined the company, it had revenue of $47 million and 1,500 employees. “They raised the bar for corporate-governance ethics in India. The board wasn’t merely an adornment to be seen. My views were respected and I had several heated debates with the management. The secret sauce is good governance, values and ethics, hard work and NRN’s vision,” he said.It has been a fabled journey for the Bengaluru company that was started by NR Narayana Murthy along with six others in 1981. It was listed on the Indian stock market in 1993 and became the first Indian registered company to list on a US stock exchange, Nasdaq, in 1999. Infosys has long been considered the gold standard for corporate governance among Indian corporates. “When in doubt, always disclose,” was Murthy’s mantra. In a webinar last year, Murthy said, “The good thing about Infosys founders is that they were high in aspiration, they were confident, they were hardworking and had good values, but we had very little money. For the first 13 years or so, none of us had a car, all of us lived in rented houses… Therefore, there was a little bit of dissatisfaction among some of the spouses.”Vallabh Bhanshali, cofounder and chairman of Enam Group and who helped launch Infosys’s IPO, said, “To me, Infosys’s value lies not so much in its market cap as much as in what it has done to arouse aspirations among Bhartiya to create enterprises that will earn the admiration of all. How that can happen only with better governance has contributed hugely to the gradual transformation of the corporate world. $100 billion is only an intermediate milestone for a company that is still young and hungry,” he told TOI. When Enam concluded the Infosys IPO, the issue had been “barely subscribed”.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/infosys-becomes-fourth-indian-firm-to-touch-100-billion-market-cap/articleshow/85612033.cms,2

The treatment provided here was on a par with private hospitals and hundreds of lives were saved. We appreciate the work done by the doctors and BMC staff,” said Congress corporator Ravi Raja, Opposition leader in the BMC. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra concurred. “Instead of spending money on temporary jumbo centres, the BMC must build more permanent hospitals, like SevenHills, to save lives,” he said.SevenHills Hospital was initially set up in 2010 as a public-private partnership between a Vizag-based hospital chain and the BMC, which provided land in lieu of free beds and treatment for poor patients. It was a 1,500-bed hospital, including 300 ICU beds, but was later shut down after a prolonged legal dispute between the two parties over treatment costs.A day after Maharashtra reported its first two Covid cases on March 9, 2020, former BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi toured the defunct Marol hospital and mobilised funds to revive it within a week. Mission ‘renew SevenHills’ started the very day Mumbai reported its first two Covid cases—on March 11, 2020—and the first international traveller walked into the quarantine facility set up on the eighth floor on March 14, 2020. Mumbai thus got India’s first Covid-19 dedicated hospital, which was fully funded by Reliance Industries Ltd. Civic officials said that between March and December 2020, the BMC spent Rs 118.7 crore on setting up and running the 300-bed hospital, and from January to March 2021, it spent Rs 63.9 crore. According to officials, the BMC has till date spent around Rs 150 crore per month on Covid-19 mitigation—a total of Rs 2,500 crore. Every year, the BMC keeps aside some money in its contingency fund. “Wh-en the pandemic broke out, we had around Rs 1,000 crore in the contingency fund, but all that money was spent to fight Covid-19. Another Rs 450 crore was needed to foot the bills when the financial year ended in March 2021,” an official said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-in-1st-wave-bmc-spent-rs-182-6cr-to-revive-run-sevenhills-hosp/articleshow/85639272.cms,2

It is the best and cleanest source of energy, which can play a fundamental role in the world's decarbonisation plans,"" he said.Hydrogen is the latest buzz for meeting the world's energy needs. Being the cleanest form of energy, it can be produced from a variety of resources, such as natural gas, biomass, and renewable power like solar and wind. It can be used in cars, in houses, for portable power and in many more applications.Green hydrogen is derived from water electrolysis using renewable energy such as solar or wind.Ambani said hydrogen has a high gravimetric energy density and can be reconverted into electricity and heat with zero emissions.""Although the costs of hydrogen from electrolysis today are high, they are expected to fall significantly in the coming years. New technologies are emerging for hydrogen storage and transportation, which will dramatically reduce the cost of distribution,"" he said.He said efforts are on globally to make green hydrogen most affordable fuel option by bringing down its cost to initially under $2 per kg.""Let me assure you all that Reliance will aggressively pursue this target and achieve it well before the turn of this decade,"" he said. ""I am sure that India can set even more aggressive target of achieving under $1 per kg within a decade.""This, according to him, will make India the first country globally to achieve $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade - the 1-1-1 target for green hydrogen.Calling climate change the most daunting challenge facing human civilisation that can threaten the very existence of life on the planet if uncontrolled, Ambani said the only option is rapid transition to a new era of green, clean and renewable energy.India, he said, is determined to achieve ""azadi"" (independence) from dependence on fossil energy and become “aatmanirbhar” (self-reliant) in new and renewal energy.India spends $160 billion every year on import oil and gas to meet its energy needs. And its energy needs will only grow.""Although India's per capita energy consumption and emissions are less than half the global average, we are the world's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases,"" he said.

International Climate Summit 2021: Here is the full text  Respected Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi,  Hon’ble Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Shri. Bhupender Yadav ji,  Hon’ble Minister of Power and New &amp;amp; Renewable Energy Shri Raj Kumar Singh ji, Hon’ble Minister of Science and Technology Shri Jitendra Singh ji,  Member Energy NITI Aayog Dr. V K Saraswat,  Former Executive Director International Energy Agency, Mr. Nobuo Tanaka Chairman Greenstat India, Mr. Sturle Pedersen Other distinguished dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen,  Good morning to all of you.  It is my privilege to deliver the inaugural address at the International Climate Summit - 2021 before this august audience.  I am delighted to see that this conference is bringing together leading policymakers, industrialists, investors, and scientists to discuss climate change and clean energy.  This Summit is taking place against the backdrop of a historic announcement by our beloved Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji on August 15.  In his address to the nation on the 75th Independence Day, he launched the Green Hydrogen Mission for India.  The fact that he chose “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav” to make this announcement has sent a powerful message to both Indians and the rest of the world.  In my view, the message is two-fold:  One, India is determined to achieve azadi from dependence on fossil energy and become atma-nirbhar in New and Renewal Energy.  Two, India will make its fullest contribution to the global effort for achieving the goals and targets of Climate Action.  Dear Friends,  Climate Change is undoubtedly the most daunting challenge facing human civilisation today. The world is witnessing with alarming frequency the disastrous effects of global warming. Glaciers are retreating. Mean sea level is rising.  Extreme and unpredictable weather changes are becoming regular. Ecological damage is becoming stark. Indeed, Climate Change, if uncontrolled, can threaten the very existence of life on our planet. Therefore, it is not enough to make our economies carbon neutral. The world needs to achieve absolute reductions in emissions as soon as possible.  We have only one option: rapid transition to a new era of green, clean and renewable energy. Because Climate Change is a global problem, the clean energy transition calls for the widest possible global cooperation in technology development, investments and fair market access.  Ladies and gentlemen,   While this clean energy transition is a global imperative, it is important for India for another reason. Most of our present energy demand is met by imported fossil fuels costing us 160 billion USD every year.  Although India’s per capita energy consumption and emissions are less than half the global average, we are the world’s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.  India’s energy needs will increase exponentially as our economic growth accelerates to fulfil the aspirations of 1.38 billion people. How do we increase our energy production while drastically reducing our carbon emission content?  Both India and the world are thus facing an unprecedented challenge. However, every challenge in human history has come with an opportunity to move to the next level of progress.  Dear Friends,  I am convinced that Climate Change is an opportunity for human civilisation to renew itself in the 21st century… An opportunity to create a healthier, happier, more secure and more resilient future for the human race…  A future in which there will be greater harmony between Man and Mother Nature. This opportunity for civilizational renewal will be realised by New and Renewable Energy. If Old Energy created the problem of Climate Change, New Energy will provide a reliable solution to Climate Mitigation.  As a matter of fact, a New GREEN REVOLUTION has already begun in India. The Old Green Revolution made India self-reliant in food production. The New Green Revolution will help make India self-sufficient in energy production.  It is a matter of great pride for all of us that India has now achieved a major milestone of 100 gigawatts installed renewable energy. India is today among the top three most attractive destinations for Renewable Energy.  The target of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by December 2022 is now well within sight.  The entire world will applaud India’s singular achievement under the leadership of our Honourable Prime Minister.  Dear Friends,  I take this opportunity to share with you my perspectives on how India can become a global leader in Green Energy Revolution in the years to come. The Indian subcontinent is truly blessed by Soorya Deva, Vayu Deva and other gods with abundant renewable energy resources.  Taking advantage of over 300 sunny days in a year, India can easily generate over 1,000 GW of solar energy on just 0.5% of our land.  Solar is perfectly suited to decentralised energy production, which in turn can promote decentralised socio-economic development. By investing in smart, two-way grids, micro-grids, efficient storage solutions and smart meters, we can enable individuals, communities and neighbourhoods to become both consumers and producers of energy.  These installations can be located close to demand. They have low maintenance requirements.  Importantly, they have little environmental impact and entail zero human displacement problems. The rapid fall in the cost of production has made solar energy highly competitive, attracting large-scale investments.  This shall play a key role in ensuring similar growth trends in “Green Hydrogen” – the future replacement of fossil fuels. Green Hydrogen is a zero-carbon energy. It is the best and cleanest source of energy, which can play a fundamental role in the world’s decarbonisation plans. Green hydrogen is key to our ever green, sustainable and prosperous future of everyone on the planet  Hydrogen has high gravimetric energy density and can be reconverted into electricity and heat with zero emissions. Although the costs of hydrogen from electrolysis today are high, they are expected to fall significantly in the coming years.  New technologies are emerging for hydrogen storage and transportation, which will dramatically reduce the cost of distribution. Furthermore, the Government of India is planning to create an enabling Green Hydrogen eco-system in the country. Because of all these developments, Green Hydrogen will surely attract significant investments.  Dear Friends,  Reliance Industries is fully committed to realising the vision of our Hon’ble Prime Minister to fuel India’s Green Economy using clean energy. Last year I had announced our ambitious commitment to make Reliance a net carbon zero company by 2035.  This year, I presented our strategy and roadmap for the New Energy Business, which will be the next big Value Creation Engine for Reliance and India. We have started developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex over 5,000 acres in Jamnagar.  It will be amongst the largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world. This complex will have four Giga Factories, which cover the entire spectrum of renewable energy. The first will be an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory. The second will be an advanced energy storage battery factory.  The third will be an electrolyser factory for the production of Green Hydrogen.  The fourth will be a fuel cell factory for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power. Over the next three years we will invest 75,000 crore rupees in these initiatives.  Reliance will thus create and offer a fully integrated, end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem to India and Indians.  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji has set the goal to reach 450GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Out of this, Reliance will establish and enable at least 100GW of solar energy by 2030.  This will create a pan-India network of kilowatt and megawatt scale solar energy producers who can produce Green Hydrogen for local consumption.  This will bring enormous benefits and prosperity to rural India. Efforts are on globally to make Green Hydrogen most affordable fuel option by bringing down its cost to initially under USD 2 per kg.  Let me assure you all that Reliance will aggressively pursue this target and achieve it well before the turn of this decade.  And India has always set and achieved even more audacious goals.   Am sure that India can set even more aggressive target of achieving under USD 1 per kg within a decade. This will make India the first country globally to achieve $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade – the 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen.  India has achieved several goals that seemed impossible over the years. I am sure this 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen will also be achieved by our talented young entrepreneurs, researchers and innovators.  Respected Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji,  You are the architect of a New India. Your vision of New India is propelled by New and Renewable Energy. It will create millions of new and high-value green jobs for our youth. It will give a big boost to green enterprises in India, who can proudly proclaim: “Made in India, by India, for India and for the world!”.  It will transform India from a large Importer of Fossil Energy to a large Exporter of Clean Energy solutions. It will also bridge the green energy divide in India and globally. I am certain that, under your dynamic leadership, India will present to the world a template of a Green Economy Movement, which will truly be a People’s Movement.  On behalf of all my colleagues in the Indian industry, on behalf of Reliance and on my own behalf, I pledge full support and commitment to your vision and mission.  Thank you.   Disclaimer:  Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Several factors have contributed to this record-breaking rally in global markets, including in India. These include the unprecedented amount of fund infusions by almost all the central banks to support their respective economies, record low interest rate in most of the large markets, and investors’ urge to channelise their savings in the absence of lack of spending opportunities during the pandemic months. 85994545On Monday, the sensex ended 167 points higher at 58,297 — its third successive session of a record closing with the intra-day high at 58,516.

Official data showed that so far in 2021, both the sensex and Nifty have rallied to fresh life-high marks around 40 times each. However, the Indian benchmarks still lag their US peers. For example, the corresponding number for the S&P500 index is 54 times. Last month, the rally got another boost after the US Fed chief said that it was unlikely to raise interest rates in a hurry. As a result, the sensex added nearly 5,000 points, or 9.4%, making India the best performing stock market in the world.Domestically, the biggest booster to investors’ wealth during the current rally since March 2020, as measured by the BSE’s market capitalisation, came from Reliance Industries that saw its market value jump by $134 billion to $210 billion now. The other significant wealth-creators are TCS, up $110 billion to $191 billion, and Infosys — up $70 billion to $110 billion now, official data showed.According to a report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL), the markets are scaling new highs led by strong earnings delivery, benign liquidity and buoyant sentiments. “Good earnings delivery (during first quarter of fiscal 2022) has boosted hopes for a solid FY22 with 30%+ projected Nifty earnings growth, on the back of a strong 15% earnings growth in FY21,” it noted. In addition to strong corporate earnings, a stable currency that’s been showing an appreciating trend in the past two weeks also attracted foreign funds into Indian markets with the net buying for 2021 at over Rs 55,000 crore, data from CDSL showed.In future, management commentaries across the board suggest an improved demand environment after June 2021, led by easing of restrictions, lower active Covid cases, and a pickup in vaccinations, the report by MOFSL noted.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-mcap-up-over-2x-in-18-months-races-past-3-5-trillion/articleshow/85994528.cms,0

Modi is betting the private sector can help farmers boost yields with apps and tools built from information such as crop output, soil quality and land holdings. Jio Platforms Ltd., the venture controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd., and tobacco giant ITC Ltd. are among local powerhouses that have signed up for the program, the government said this week.With the project, Modi is seeking to usher in long-due reforms to make over a $488 billion farm sector that employs almost half of the nation’s 1.3 billion people and accounts for about 18% of Asia’s third-biggest economy. The government is counting on the project’s success to boost rural incomes, cut imports, reduce some of the world’s worst food wastages with better infrastructure, and eventually compete with exporters such as Brazil, the US and the European Union. For global firms, it’s a stab at India’s agri-tech industry, which Ernst & Young estimates to have the potential to reach about $24 billion in revenue by 2025, with the current penetration being only 1%. It’s also a chance to deploy networks, artificial intelligence and machine learning in a developing country, while for e-commerce firms such as Amazon and Reliance, securing a steady stream of farm produce could help crack a groceries market that accounts for well over half of the $1 trillion in annual retail spending by Indians.“This is a high impact industry and private players are sensing the opportunity and want to be a large part of it,” said Ankur Pahwa, a partner at consultancy EY India. “India has a very high amount of food wastage because of lack of technology and infrastructure. So there’s a huge upside to the program.” The idea is simple: Seed all the information such as crop pattern, soil health, insurance, credit, and weather patterns into a single database and then analyze it through AI and data analytics. Then the goal is to develop personalized services for a sector replete with challenges such as peaking yields, water stress, degrading soil and lack of infrastructure including temperature-controlled warehouses and refrigerated trucks.Under the agreement, the big tech companies help the government in developing proof of concepts to offer tech solutions for farm-to-fork services, which farmers will be able to access at their doorstep. If beneficial, firms would be able to sell the final product to the government and also directly to growers and the solutions would be scaled up at the national level. So far, the government has seeded publicly available data for more than 50 million farmers of the 120 million identified land-holding growers. Some of the local companies that have signed up include Star Agribazaar Technology, ESRI India Technologies, yoga guru Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali Organic Research Institute and Ninjacart.“A database would be useful for a variety of purposes — agri-marketing, targeting of subsidies” and more, said Sanjay Mathur, chief economist for Asean and India at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “It does lead to a more efficient structure for the rural sector.”But success is far from guaranteed. The plan to rope in big corporations is already drawing fire from critics, who say the move is yet another attempt by the government to give the private sector a greater sway, a development that could hurt small and vulnerable farmers. The program may even add fuel to the protracted protests Modi’s government has been struggling to tackle for more than nine months after controversial new agricultural laws riled up some farmers. With crucial state elections due in 2022, it may get tougher to sell the technology-to-help-agriculture concept to a farming community already suspicious of the government’s intentions. “With this data they will know where the produce wasn’t good, and will buy cheap from farmers there and sell it at exorbitant prices elsewhere,” said Sukhwinder Singh Sabhra, a farmer from the northern state of Punjab, who has been protesting since November against the new farm laws. “More than the farmers it is the consumers who will suffer.” Technology adoption is still at a nascent stage in India, said Apeksha Kaushik, principal analyst at Gartner. “Limited availability of technology infrastructure and recurring natural phenomena like floods, droughts have also worked against the deployment of digital solutions,” she said.Anxiety over data privacy could be another challenge. Abhimanyu Kohar, a 27-year-old farmers’ leader, who has been supporting the protesting farmers, said it’s a “serious issue.” “We all know the record of the government in keeping the data safe,” he said. Despite the hurdles, a few one-year pro bono pilot programs are already underway.Microsoft has selected 100 villages to deploy AI and machine learning and build a platform. Amazon, which has already started offering real-time advice and information to farmers through a mobile app, is offering cloud services to solution providers. Representatives at the India offices of Microsoft and Amazon didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. Star Agribazaar, whose co-founder Amit Mundawala calls the project a “game changer,” will collect data on agri land profiling, crop estimation, soil degradation and weather patterns. ESRI India is using geographic information system to generate data and create applications, according to Managing Director Agendra Kumar. “Once you have the data, you can correlate with on-ground reality and improve your projections, take informed decisions and see which regions need policy intervention,” said PK Joshi, former director for South Asia at Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute.A similar data-driven system implemented in the southern state of Karnataka last year helped increase efficiency in delivery of government benefits, said Rajeev Chawla, the state’s additional chief secretary. Some bank loans have even been made to farmers using the centralized data, and all government programs, verification for insurance and loans and minimum support price are being routed through the mechanism, plugging leakages and eliminating frauds, he said.Besides the tech giants, many smaller companies and startups are likely to join the program. When completed the project will form the core of a national digital agriculture ecosystem to help farmers realize better profitability with access to right information at the right time, and to facilitate better planning and execution of policies, according to the government’s consultation paper on digital agriculture.“How this exercise will translate into action or lead to higher production and farm income, that remains to be seen,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings Ltd.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/amazon-microsoft-swoop-in-on-24-billion-india-farm-data-trove/articleshow/86283554.cms,0

We have done this in just two years and our renewables portfolio has reached our initial target of 25 Gigawatts (GW) a full four years ahead of schedule. This puts us well on track to be the world's largest renewable power generating company by 2030,” Adani said.“Our actions clearly indicate that we are putting our money where our mouth is: Over 75% of our planned capex until 2025 will be in green technologies. Today, of our EBITDA from utilities, 43% is already from the green business.”The group is the country’s largest private producer of power from coal-fired stations as well as renewable sources and aggressively pursuing a transition to cleaner energy. The group plans to triple renewable generation capacity over the next four years, power all data centres with renewable energy and turn its ports into net-zero by 2025.On climate change, Adani also hit out at the developed economies that are criticising the pace of India’s climate reform and pressuring New Delhi to announce a net-zero goal. “The economic and industrial might of the West sits on a carpet of carbon soot several centuries deep. A hundred years ago, today's climate reformers were burning over 800 million tonnes of coal – that is more coal than what India produces today. From pre-industrial times until now, India accounts for only 3% of the extra carbon in the atmosphere and will eventually end up consuming less than 8% of the entire remaining carbon budget,” he said.“India accounts for only 3% of the extra carbon in the atmosphere while supporting 17% of the world’s population in one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. Those criticising our reluctance to directly adopt western advice on climate change must deeply consider the disparity in the situation. It is impractical to suggest alternatives that the developing world does not have, cannot use and cannot afford,"" he said.""In my country, more than a quarter-billion households and millions of small businesses that generate jobs rely on the availability of cheaply produced electricity.

As a result, the sensex scaled a life-high mark at 59,957 points and closed just a tad off that level at 59,885 — up 958 points on the day.Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, HDFC and ICICI Bank led the gainers, while profit-taking in ITC, Dr Reddy’s and Nestle limited the rise, but only marginally, according to BSE data. On the NSE, the Nifty too closed at a new life-high level of 17,823, up 276 points on the day.Market players said that the statements by US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell that the central bank would slowly bring an end to its bond-buying programme, called tapering, and not raise rate of interest in a hurry, gave clarity among global investors.

Reports that Chinese authorities were working overnight to limit the contagion of the debt crisis in its real estate sector from spreading to other segments and countries also helped global investor sentiment, they said.As a result, the sensex opened more than 400 points higher and rallied through the session close to the psychologically vital 60k mark in late trades on Thursday. Thursday’s rally also pushed investors’ wealth, measured in terms of BSE’s market capitalisation, to a record high at Rs 264 lakh crore, or about $3.6 trillion — a level very close to that of the UK’s. Last week, India had surpassed France to become the sixth largest country in terms of market capitalisation.According to Geojit Financial Services head (research) Vinod Nair, global markets tempered optimism despite a slightly hawkish tilt by the US Fed that said that the US central bank will begin reducing its asset purchases in November and conclude the tapering process around mid-2022. “However, investors continue to remain on edge, awaiting clarity on the Chinese economy. The domestic reality sector continued its rally sparked by demand revival in the property space,” Nair said.Traders said that the rally on D-Street is expected to continue on Friday after US markets opened strong and continued their rise, boosted by the US Fed’s statement on Wednesday night. In mid-session, the Dow Jones index was up 1.6%, while S&P 500 was up 1.4% and Nasdaq Composite up 1%.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-feds-clarity-on-tapering-takes-sensex-close-to-60k/articleshow/86467180.cms,0

This is because liquid auto fuel prices have also been climbing in recent months, given the rise in crude oil prices.The cost of power generated by gas-based power plants will increase, which will further decrease their utilisation.""ONGC's and OIL's ratings and standalone credit profiles (SCP) remain unchanged as the price increase was largely in line with Fitch's expectations, driven by the rise in global prices over July 2020-June 2021,"" the rating agency said in a statement.However, sustained high gas prices will strengthen ONGC's 'bbb+' SCP and will add buffer to OIL's credit metrics, which will support its capex to expand capacity at subsidiary Numaligarh Refinery Ltd.The government also increased the price ceiling for gas produced from deepwater and other difficult fields to $6.13 per mmBtu from $3.62 per mmBtu.""Reliance Industries Ltd's gas production from KG basin will benefit from the higher price ceiling, but the impact on RIL's financial profile is minimal as gas makes a limited contribution to its revenue,"" Fitch said.The rating agency estimated ONGC's net leverage, measured by net debt/EBITDA, to improve to around 2.1x in the financial year ending March 2022 (FY22) from 2.7x in FY21 as upstream earnings recover and downstream earnings stay resilient.Natural gas' share of consolidated revenues is in the mid-single digits for ONGC, given its integrated business model.It expects OIL's FY22 leverage to be 1.9x. Natural gas accounted for about 13 per cent of OIL's upstream revenue in FY21, Fitch said.

He’s now worth $100.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, after his wealth increased by $23.8 billion this year.Since inheriting the oil-refining and petrochemicals businesses of his late father’s empire in 2005, Ambani, 64, has been seeking to transform the energy giant into a retail, technology and e-commerce titan. His telecommunications unit, which started services in 2016, is now the dominant carrier in the Indian market. His retail and technology ventures raised about $27 billion last year, selling stakes to investors ranging from Facebook Inc and Google to KKR & Co and Silver Lake.<iframe title=""Ambani entered the elite club of individuals who hold fortunes in excess of $100 billion"" aria-label=""Bar Chart"" id=""datawrapper-chart-LabRW"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/LabRW/1/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""424""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>Ambani unveiled an ambitious push into green energy in June, with a planned investment of about $10 billion over three years. And last month, the mogul said his company would “aggressively” pursue production of cheaper green hydrogen. The plan aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitions of turning India into a global manufacturing hub for the cleaner fuel to combat climate change and slash energy imports by the world’s third-biggest oil consumer. While Ambani’s announcement has been viewed by some as an acknowledgment that his group needs to look beyond oil to cement its future, the fossil fuel still plays a central role at Reliance, accounting for almost 60% of its $73 billion in annual revenue. The oil-to-chemicals business is now a separate unit, and talks are under way to get Saudi Arabian Oil Co. as an investor.“Mukesh Ambani is at the forefront of creating new businesses with new emerging technologies,” said Chakri Lokapriya, chief investment officer at TCG Asset Management Co in Mumbai. “Creating businesses of scale at speed brings execution challenges, but he has demonstrated his capabilities.”The story of Reliance dates back to the late 1960s when Dhirubhai Ambani, who started out as a gas-station attendant in Yemen, began building his polyester business into a vast empire. When he died of a stroke in 2002 without leaving a will, a succession feud erupted between his two sons, Mukesh and Anil, 62, which was eventually settled by the siblings’ mother, Kokilaben, in 2005. Under the truce agreement, Mukesh got control of the flagship oil refining and petrochemicals businesses, while his younger brother got newer areas such as power generation, financial services and telecommunications services. Anil -- once a billionaire -- told a London court last year that his net worth was “zero.”India’s billionaires are some of the largest gainers on the world’s rich list, as Asia’s best-performing major stock market this year gets a boost from a surge in initial public offerings.

But this licence was transferred to its subsidiary Reliance BP Mobility (RBML).And so, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's firm applied and got another licence.A separate joint venture of the firm with BP, called RBML Solutions India Ltd too has got a licence.It isn't clear if RIL and RBML Solutions will set up separate, competing petrol pumps.Besides doing away with the earlier requirement of investing Rs 2,000 crore in oil and gas sector to be eligible for a fuel retailing licence, the new liberalised petrol pump norms require licensees to set up a minimum of 100 outlets with at least 5 per cent of them in remote areas.The licensee is required to ""install facilities for marketing at least one new generation alternate fuels like compressed natural gas (CNG), biofuels, liquefied natural gas, electric vehicle charging points etc at their proposed retail outlets within three years of operationalisation of the said outlet.""It fixes Rs 250 crore as the minimum net worth for obtaining the licence.State-owned oil marketing companies -- Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) -- currently own most of the 78,751 petrol pumps in the country.RBML, Nayara Energy (formerly Essar Oil) and Royal Dutch Shell are the private players in the market but with limited presence. RBML has 1,427 outlets, Nayara 6,250 while Shell has just 285 pumps.BP had a few years back secured a licence to set up 3,500 pumps but has not yet started doing so. It has since decided to venture into the business with RIL with plans to scale up RIL's present network strength to 5,500.Those granted licences include Chennai-based IMC (once called Indian Molasses Company), which specialises in oil terminals, and Assam government firm, Assam Gas Company.Assam Gas Company is in the business of gas transportation.Not much is known about Onsite Energy which was incorporated in May 2020.M K Agrotech is part of a diversified conglomerate with interests across agricultural products such as sunflower oil, real estate, and crude oil and gas extraction, while Manas Agro Industries and Infrastructure has its own brand of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG or cooking gas).

To begin with, NTPC aims to reach out to its 200-home housing colony at Kawas near Surat by using about 100 cm/d of PNG where it will initially blend hydrogen to the extent of 5% for domestic use, to be later ramped up to 20%. 86929790“The residential township project will be the first of its kind in the country where we plan to blend green hydrogen in the city gas distribution (CGD) network. Once this is successful, we plan to roll it out in various cities and towns of India with our CGD partner,” said an official of NTPC aware of the development. He said that similar pilot projects have been carried out in countries like Australia and UK where they have been successful and are now awaiting commercial rollout. NTPC floated an EoI for Indian and global companies to set up the pilot project on green hydrogen blending with natural gas in the CGD, which received an overwhelming response, the official said. Through the EoI process, NTPC aims to identify companies capable of providing hydrogen blending solutions for the pilot project of 100 cm/d gas. Once the EoI process is over, NTPC will float a tender in the next two months or so. The successful bidder will have to design a blending system, select the technology for electrolyser and hydrogen storage system. In his latest Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had stressed upon the importance of India to transform into a hydrogen-based economy while announcing the launch of the National Hydrogen Mission. The company aims to roll out the pilot project by the end of this financial year. ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ntpc-guj-gas-blend-hydrogen-for-homes/articleshow/86916730.cms,2

A couple of days ago, RIL inked deals to buy Norwegian-headquartered solar panel maker REC Solar Holdings and India’s Sterling and Wilson Solar. NexWafe develops and produces monocrystalline silicon wafers grown directly from inexpensive raw materials. By going directly from the gas phase to finished wafers, it obviates the need for costly and energy-intensive intermediate steps such as polysilicon production and ingot pulling on which traditional wafer manufacturing relies. The NexWafe transaction is expected to be completed by the end of this month. The investment will be routed through Reliance New Energy Solar and will accelerate product and technology development for NexWafe, including completion of the commercial development of NexWafe’s solar photovoltaics products on prototype lines in Freiburg, RIL said in a late night regulatory filing. Besides its deal with NexWafe, RIL has also signed an arrangement with Denmark’s Stiesdal to manufacture the latter’s hydrogen electrolyzers in India. The technology for hydrogen electrolyzers has the potential to deliver significant cost reduction compared to currently available technologies thereby paving the way for rapid decarbonization, RIL said. The proposed acquisitions are part of RIL’s plans to become net carbon zero by 2035. In June, it had said that it would invest $10 billion in clean energy over three years. NexWafe incorporated on May 18, 2015 had a turnover of 1.41 lakh euros in fiscal 2020.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-invests-in-german-co-3rd-solar-deal-within-3-days/articleshow/86979264.cms,0

The group’s planned structure resembles the way Tata Sons and Reliance Industries are organised, with a central unit handling corporate-wide activities such as finance, and independent business arms focused on specific segments. Poddar, the reticent businessman from Kolkata, gained Zuari Agro after his father-in-law K K Birla bequeathed the fertiliser business to him and his wife Jyotsna. He subsequently ramped up the business by acquiring Mangalore Chemicals from Vijay Mallya, the former chairman of United Breweries and United Spirits.As part of the overhaul, Zuari Agro is in the middle of transferring the farm retail and the Goa fertiliser businesses to two separate subsidiaries. The realignment will leave Zuari Agro with the residue fertiliser business (the single superphosphate or SSP plant in Maharashtra) and investments in multiple operating entities. “We will explore options including carving out the SSP business in the future,” said Zuari Agro non-executive director Suresh Krishnan.Zuari Agro, in which Poddar and family own 65%, has a market cap of over Rs 520 crore. “A holding company structure helps to have a higher controlling stake with lower beneficial shareholding in operating entities,” said InGovern founder Shriram Subramanian. Krishnan added that the restructuring also aids to attract investments in specific businesses as certain investors would not like to have a finger in every pie. Zuari Agro is in advanced stages to sell up to 30% in the farm retail business (Zuari FarmHub) to Morocco’s OCP. Adventz is, however, unfazed if Zuari Agro trades at a discount in the stock market after the change in status as traditionally the market value of holding companies like Pilani Investments (controlled by Kumar Mangalam Birla) are captured at a discount. “We fully realise that there will be a discount for the holding company but at the same time the kind of value that the individual parts can make on their own will offset,” Krishnan said. After the restructuring and the expansion of the fertiliser business, Zuari Agro will be close to the top private sector player Coromandel (part of Murugappa Group) in terms of capacity (over 3-million metric tonne). Besides agri, Poddar has interests in engineering & infrastructure, lifestyle and financial services. The septuagenarian is best known for introducing men’s shaving brand Gillette, French furniture maker Gautier and Duracell batteries to Indian consumers.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/saroj-poddar-to-create-zuari-holding-co-for-agri/articleshow/87093997.cms,2

Future denies any wrongdoing.After the Singapore arbitrator put the deal on hold last year in an interim decision, Future argued it should be excluded from arbitration because Amazon had initiated it incorrectly under a contract it signed with another Future group company.In an order on Wednesday, which is not public but has been reviewed by Reuters, the panel disagreed with Future. It said the three agreements at the heart of the Future-Amazon dispute must be read together, and not separately, as Future argued.The three agreements were of ""composite nature"", ""wide and comprehensive enough"" and the tribunal ""has jurisdiction over FRL (Future Retail) in this Arbitration,"" said the 69-page order.Future and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The main arbitration proceedings will now begin in due course, people familiar with the matter said.The dispute started after Future, India's second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores, entered into a deal last year to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and certain other businesses to Reliance, after Covid-19 hit its operations hard.Amazon had its sights on ultimately owning some of Future's retail assets itself. It has argued a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit contained clauses prohibiting the group from selling its retail assets to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list that included Reliance.Amazon brought proceedings against Future before a Singapore arbitration panel, and the dispute is also being fought at various Indian legal forums.The outcome of the tussle involving two of the world’s richest men, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Reliance’s Mukesh Ambani, could reshape pandemic-hit shopping sector and help determine whether Amazon can blunt Reliance's dominance of India's almost one trillion-dollar retail market.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/future-retail-must-take-part-in-amazon-dispute-arbitration-singapore-panel-says/articleshow/87163636.cms,1

The meeting scheduled to be held in the second week of November is being seen as the first step in the proposed sale of Future Group’s retail, warehousing and logistics assets to Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries. Amazon, locked in a bitter legal with the Future Group, wants to block the deal. Future Retail had originally approached SIAC with two pleas. It had contented that it was not a party to the agreement signed between Future Coupons and Amazon in 2019, through which the e-tailer had pumped in around Rs 1,400 into FCPL. Secondly, FRL urged SIAC to lift the interim stay on its deal to sell its assets to Reliance Retail. Amazon claimed the investment gave it an indirect stake in the flagship Future Group company, which operates supermarket chain Big Bazaar, as FCPL owned around 10% stake in FRL. The subsequent announcement of Future Group’s proposed asset sale to Reliance, however, saw the e-tailer dragging the Big Bazaar parent to SIAC in October last year, which granted Amazon an interim award over the Future-Reliance deal. Amazon alleged that the Future Group violated contractual agreements due to the proposed deal with Reliance. A Future Group spokesperson and Amazon did not comment for this story. In a stock exchange filing, FRL said, “Further to our earlier intimation(s), we would like to inform that the advocates of the Company are in receipt of an intimation from advocates of Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC (“Amazon”) that Amazon has filed an Interim Application in the SLP (Civil) Nos. 13556-13557 of 2021 filed by the Company and pending before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/singapore-tribunal-rejects-future-retails-plea-to-lift-interim-stay-on-its-asset-sale-to-reliance-retail/articleshow/87190439.cms,2

The joint venture is to operate under the 'Jio-bp' brand. bpSpeaking at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek over a video link, BP chief executive Bernard Looney said the plan is to take the number of petrol pumps to 5,500 by 2025.""We have about 1,500 sites (petrol pumps) that traditionally were Reliance sites and now have become Jio-bp sites. We are about to open what will be Jio-bp's truly first site near Mumbai,"" he said, adding he would visit India next month.BP's partnership with Reliance started with upstream, after the firm picked up a 30 per cent stake in KG-D6 and other blocks. It has since ""evolved in convenience and mobility side and it will evolve further over time,"" he said.Reliance-BP has brought two sets of gas fields for production in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block and is working on a third project.""We have a goal to supply 15 per cent of India's natural gas needs,"" he said, adding the third project would start producing by the end of next year.The two projects currently produce about 18 million standard cubic meters per day of gas, which will rise to 30 mmscmd once the third goes live.Asked about expanding that partnership, he said, ""we do see an opportunity to expand that business over time. We are looking at adjacent licenses, blocks around us.""He did not elaborate.Reliance-BP acquired an exploration block in the 2019 auction of oil and gas blocks.Looney said BP will ""over time look at electrification agenda"" by setting up electric vehicle charging infrastructure.It currently has a separate joint venture for battery swapping for two and three-wheelers.""I am very excited about the growth that exists (in India),"" he said adding over time the firm's presence in the country will evolve ""from molecule to electrons"".Talking of potential that exists in India, he said in one of the demand scenarios, BP sees the country representing 90 per cent of energy growth in the world between now and 2050.""It is one of the most important countries for BP,"" he said. ""We are hugely committed to the country and the partnership (with Reliance).""On the upheaval in the global energy markets, he said it only underscored how much energy is the lifeblood of society.The sharp spike in natural gas price has underscored the need to ""invest in longer-term (supply) contracts, invest in natural gas, invest into storages and invest into diversification,"" he said, adding redundancy must be built into the energy systems to avoid a repeat of the current scenario where demand suddenly outpaced supply because of a combination of events ranging from demand in Asia coming back to cold weather in Europe and less rainfall in Brazil.Reliance holds the remaining 51 per cent stake in Reliance BP Mobility Ltd (RBML).RBML has already received the marketing authorisation for transportation fuels.The joint venture after taking over Reliance's existing petrol pumps started selling fuels and Castrol lubricants. In due course, the outlets will be rebranded 'Jio-bp'.India's auto fuel retailing is dominated by public sector oil companies that own the majority of 78,751 petrol pumps in the country. RBML has 1,427 outlets while Rosneft-back Nayara Energy has 6,250 pumps. Shell has 285 petrol pumps.

The rapidly growing natural gas demand in the country offered huge investment potential for developing gas infrastructure, he said.On their part, the CEOs noted that India is adapting fast to newer forms of clean energy technology and can play a significant role in shaping global energy supply chains.

","Shareholders of Reliance Industries have approved the appointment of Saudi Aramco Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan on the company board, with less than 2 per cent of votes cast against the proposal.  Disclosing the results of shareholder votes on the appointment, Reliance in a regulatory filing said 98.03 per cent of votes were cast in favour of the resolution to appoint Al-Rumayyan for three years.  As many as 10.89 crore shares or 1.96 per cent voted against the resolution, while 3.23 crore votes were declared invalid due to lack of proper authorisation, it said.  The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), a shareholder of Reliance, had last month decided to vote against the move based on US proxy advisory research firm Glass Lewis' recommendation.  CalSTRS decided to oppose the appointment due to Al-Rumayyan's position in Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) as its governor, as well as in Aramco.  PIF has already invested Rs 9,555 crore in Reliance Retail and Rs 11,367 crore in RIL's Jio Platforms. Also, Aramco is in talks to buy a 20 per cent stake in Reliance's oil-to-chemical business.  Reliance had, however, rejected conflict of interest allegations saying, &quot;The appointment of Yasir Al Rumayyan has no connection with the contemplated transaction with Saudi Aramco&quot;.  The O2C business of RIL is being spun off to a subsidiary.  &quot;As per the terms of the proposed transaction, Saudi Aramco will participate in the equity of the O2C subsidiary. The O2C subsidiary board may have nominees of Saudi Aramco to protect its interest,&quot; it added.  As of June 30, 2020, CalSTRS held 5.3 million fully and partly paid shares of RIL, according to its website. CalSTRS is America's second-largest public pension fund with assets totalling approximately USD 318.4 billion as of August 31, 2021.  CalSTRS's opposition was based on a report by Glass, Lewis &amp;amp; Co, an American proxy advisory services company. According to Glass, Lewis &amp;amp; Co, since Al-Rumayyan has a key role in the operations of Aramco and PIF, he does not qualify to be an independent director.  Under Indian law, an independent director cannot have a role in any company that has a business or equity partnership with the firm that intends to appoint him or her.

Retail Business  Reliance Retail delivered strong performance with revenue from operations growing 9.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 39,926 crore in September 2021 quarter which saw robust growth across all consumption baskets led by strong revival in consumer sentiments amid festivities, relaxations in Covid related curbs and vaccinations.  &quot;The business re-established growth momentum in fashion &amp;amp; lifestyle with sales closing above pre-Covid levels.

Oil-To-Chemicals Business  The O2C business sustained growth momentum, registering a 58.1 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1.2 lakh crore primarily due to improved realisation on the back of increase in oil prices and higher volumes. Refinery throughput increased by 11.8 percent YoY to 17.1 MMT (million metric tonnes) during the quarter.  Crude prices were lifted higher by tighter supply amid multiple production outages, lowering in uptick of Covid infections and higher overall throughput. Brent crude averaged $73.5 a barrel in Q2FY22, up by $4.6 QoQ and $30.5 YoY).  Reliance said O2C business EBITDA improved by 43.9 percent YoY to Rs 12,720 crore primarily on account of better transportation fuel cracks, higher intermediates product deltas, efficient product placement and yield management. However, &quot;EBITDA margin for the quarter declined by 100bps YoY to 10.6 percent due to base effect driven by higher feedstock and product prices,&quot; it noted.  Solar Energy Business  Reliance Industries has increased its focus on solar energy segment as it is going to establish and enable up to 100 GW of solar energy in India by 2030, and become a global player in the renewable industry.  &quot;We continue to make steady progress in accelerating foray into new energy and new materials business.

The Reliance stock price hit a record high of Rs 2,750 on the BSE on October 19, with a market capitalisation of almost Rs 18.3 lakh crore. The stock had a strong run-up recently after the company signed several deals in the solar energy business. It has gained 24 percent since the beginning of July.  The September quarter earnings, to be declared on October 22, will likely decide the direction of the stock price.  Experts said Reliance’s retail and digital businesses, which accounted for 32.4 percent and 18.5 percent of total revenue, respectively, could be the stars in the September quarter, driving double-digit growth in every earnings parameter.  “Retail and digital business will post a strong recovery,” Motilal Oswal said in its earnings preview. The brokerage, which has a ‘buy’ call on the stock, expects consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) growth of 24 percent YoY, driven by the retail and digital businesses, and revenue growth of 34 percent YoY.  Motilal Oswal expects the oil-to-chemical segment’s EBITDA to grow by 39 percent, Reliance Jio’s EBITDA to increase by 21 percent, and retail EBITDA to grow by 38 percent from a year earlier.  Yes Securities expects Reliance to report better earnings (QoQ and YoY) on improved retail profitability and refinery margins.  The benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) was at $3.7 a barrel, the highest in the past seven quarters, improving further QoQ in Q2 of FY22, led by better gasoline, aviation turbine fuel and naphtha cracks amid hurricane-led supply disruptions, said Motilal Oswal. GRM is a measure of the amount that refiners earn from turning each barrel of crude oil into fuel products.  Brent crude prices averaged $73 a barrel in Q2, a jump of about 70 percent YoY and 6 percent QoQ, due to supply-side disruptions and inventory shortages. This despite OPEC+ easing production cuts starting in August. Recent hurricanes in the US have taken out more than 25 million barrels of offshore production, said Motilal Oswal.  Brent prices have been increasing and crossed $86 a barrel on October 21 for the first time since October 2018. The rally in prices is largely because of expectations of strong global growth, power outages mainly in China, and supply concerns.  Kotak, too, expects strong earnings growth at Reliance for the quarter, with consolidated profit rising 38.3 percent, EBITDA up 35.1 percent and revenue increasing 32.1 percent YoY.

Future denies any wrongdoing.A Singapore arbitrator last year put the Future-Reliance deal on hold, and the panel last week declined Future's request to revoke that decision. On Wednesday, Future asked the Delhi High Court to intervene and quash the arbitrator's decision according to Indian law, its legal filing seen by Reuters shows.""The Arbitral Tribunal erroneously rejected FRL's (Future Retail) contention,"" its filing stated. ""FRL submits that the standards applied by the Arbitral Tribunal ... are incorrect.""Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Future is India's second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores and has warned that failure to strike the deal with Reliance could push it into liquidation.The dispute started when Future, hamstrung by an economic hit from the Covid-19 pandemic, entered into a deal last year to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and certain other businesses to Reliance.Amazon had its sights on ultimately owning some of Future's retail assets itself. It has argued a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling its retail assets to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list that included Reliance.The outcome of the tussle involving two of the world's richest men, Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Reliance's Mukesh Ambani, is seen as reshaping s pandemic-hit shopping sector and deciding whether Amazon can blunt Reliance's dominance of the country's nearly trillion-dollar retail market.

Pvt investment at 16-year-high,"India News: This festive season may actually bring some reason to cheer. Private investment has been picking up, large new projects mean greater scope for capacit","For more than a decade now, India’s economy has struggled against a slew of challenges, from regulatory issues to corruption to rising bad debt. But this festival season may bring some light into a hitherto gloomy scenario. Domestic and global consumption seems to be picking up, which is good news for manufacturing and exports. Private investment has gone up, as have project sizes. Projects Today, a databank with information on new and ongoing projects from all sectors across India, estimates that this is the first time in 16 years that private investment has been so robust. Green shoots of recoveryEveryone, from the Prime Minister down, has been talking about the Indian economy looking up. Here are numbers that corroborate what they are saying. For the first time in 16 years – since 2006-07 when the Indian economy grew well on the back of robust exports surge – fresh investment by the private sector is reaching new peak at Rs 4,78,564 crore in the first half of 2021-22, says Shashikant Hegde, CEO, Projects Today. Over the last decade or so, India’s economy has grappled with a host of issues, including multiple scams across sectors, mired infrastructure projects, a rising NPA crisis, tightening regulatory norms, demonetisation, and teething troubles of GST implementation. Economic growth was measly, and what there was did not promote employment. All this naturally had an impact on investments in capacity expansion and greenfield projects.There are many reasons put forward for the tide now turning. Global strategic shifts, such as countries looking for viable alternatives to China, have seen multinationals reassess India as an investment destination. The government, on its part, has tried to boost manufacturing through schemes such as the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for specific sectors. The PLI scheme has resulted in healthy investments in selected sectors; EY, in a post on its site, reckons that the initial round of PLI schemes spanning mobile phones, drugs and medical devices attracted investments of over $5 billion.It’s not just increased investment; the average size of projects has also been going up. In the first half of this financial year, 70 mega private projects accounted for 43.24% of the total fresh investment announced. <iframe title=""Fresh investments by private sector increase"" aria-label=""table"" id=""datawrapper-chart-Q4J0E"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/Q4J0E/4/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""790""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>Remember, this is at a time when domestic consumption has been picking up after a blighted pandemic year. The big question to ask is will all this buoy India’s job market? The non-tech areas like manufacturing and infrastructure have traditionally absorbed millions of workers migrating from a farm to non-farm economy. If that happens, this investment can unleash a multiplier effect.While private investment has seen a marked increase, the same cannot be said of government investment which has remained low over the past few years. At Rs 2,64,246 crore in the first half of FY22, it’s almost half the peak it was in H1 FY17 when it stood at Rs 5,04,787 crore. Even the number of projects has been fewer.  <iframe title=""Fresh investments by govt low"" aria-label=""table"" id=""datawrapper-chart-RmgOQ"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/RmgOQ/2/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""790""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>Turnaround in manufacturingThe PLI scheme, which seems to have made a difference in attracting investment in manufacturing, is part of the government’s greater ‘Make In India’ push. The idea behind the PLI scheme is to scale up domestic manufacturing and encourage import substitution. It seems to be working. Investments in manufacturing have witnessed the sharpest turnaround. From a low Rs 86,168 crore in H1 FY20, it has crossed Rs 2,78,606 crore in H1 2022. Compare this with the muted investments in the infrastructure sector – from Rs 4,12,771 crore in the first half of FY20 to an even lower Rs 3,11,058 crore in H1 FY22.The pick-up in manufacturing investments is heartening; for long, experts have mourned the fact that manufacturing GDP contributed a mere 18% to India’s total GDP. Equally important, with more investments and capacity expansion in manufacturing, this sector could offer employment to a large section of the 400-million-strong workforce that is still primarily employed in the low-profit agricultural sector. However, with rapid automation and digitisation – even in the manufacturing sector – it remains to be seen what kind of jobs are created, both qualitatively and quantitatively. medium nocaption87340554States lag, MNCs push pedalAs we have seen above, the government lags in terms of investments. Analysing the investments announced by the central government and the state governments, it is clear that it’s the fund-starved state governments who have been laggards. From Rs 1,78,055 crore (2,900 projects) in H1 FY20, state investments dipped to Rs 100,859 crore (2246 projects) in H1 FY22.In contrast, in the private sector – Indian as well as MNC – increased their quantum of investments. Total investments have gone up from Rs 3,27,411 crore in H1 FY20 (1955 projects) to Rs 4,87,634 crore in H1 FY22 (2012 projects). Foreign investments have shown even sharper growth from Rs 19,379 crore (53 projects) to Rs 64,792 crore (73 projects) during the respective periods. medium nocaption87341495Private sector investments were in the areas of food processing, drugs & pharma, plastic products, electronics, automobiles, data centres and textiles. Recall that these are also the sectors in which the PLI scheme applies. Among the large projects announced in the first half of FY22 are a Rs 60,000 crore Green Energy Giga Complex of Reliance Industries; Rs 29,200 crore PVC plant of Adani Enterprises; Rs 25,000 crore wind power project of JSW Energy; Rs 18,000 crore passenger cars project of Maruti Suzuki; and Rs 15,000 crore data centre project of Microsoft Corporation (India).Unequal statesIn a country where economic growth has been unequally distributed, investment data indicate that the trend continues. The top five states by investment are Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka and Odisha. The five of them together account for half of total fresh investments announced in H1 FY22. Gujarat leads with 612 projects worth Rs 1,32,169.47 crore. It is followed by Maharashtra and Telangana with total fresh investment of Rs 1,03,106.70 crore and Rs 55,670.30 crore respectively. <iframe title=""Gujarat leads in fresh expenditure by states"" aria-label=""table"" id=""datawrapper-chart-6jJJ7"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/6jJJ7/2/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""647""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>Gujarat and Maharashtra, are also the preferred destinations of private investors and have managed to attract most of the mega projects announced in the country. During H1/FY22, of the 111 new mega projects, 21 were located in these two states. While the 11 mega projects worth Rs 1,04,486.92 crore accounted for 79 percent of the total fresh investment attracted by Gujarat, 10 mega projects worth Rs 52,404.93 crore accounted for 50.83 percent of the total fresh investment attracted by Maharashtra.It is interesting to note that despite all the buzz and the upcoming state elections, Uttar Pradesh ranks much lower with just Rs 36,476 crore investments across 253 projects.Untitled Carousel 87280949",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/best-news-on-the-economy-pvt-investment-at-16-year-high/articleshow/87336141.cms,0

But that’s already unrealistic. With temperatures 1.1 degrees higher than in the second half of the 19th century and greenhouse gas emissions still rising, the ambitious goal adopted by 196 countries in Paris six years ago is a near-certain miss.That will no doubt lead to a new round of finger-pointing between rich and poor nations about how each side is being unreasonable and unfair. For a clue to how this depressing stalemate will ever be resolved, cast your gaze to Gujarat, where there’s no sense of defeat, or even righteous indignation about being forced to go on a low-emission diet by those who were early to industrialise.Instead, two of the world’s richest businessmen are furiously writing billion-dollar checks in their race to shape our climate future. Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani owe their fortunes to carbon, and yet it’s in hydrogen — the simplest known element — where a complex contest between them could open a pathway to decarbonised economic growth. India’s official position is that net zero emissions by 2050 is an unjust demand. Yet, the optimism of the tycoons from Gujarat offers a way out of the impasse. Betting on one or both to succeed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi might promise to do more for the climate, though real work for his team will start only after returning from Glasgow. That’s when Ambani, 64, and Adani, 59, will want supportive policies.Ambani owes his top spot on Asia’s rich list to Gujarat’s Jamnagar, host to the world’s largest oil-refining complex. It spews out spare cash to invest in retail and the internet. Pivoting away from fossil fuels, Ambani is setting up four new factories in the district, one each for solar panels, batteries, green hydrogen and fuel cells. His flagship Reliance Industries has so far spent $1.2 billion on acquisitions and partnerships, and already Bernstein analysts believe the new enterprise to be worth $36 billion, compared with $30 billion for the decades-old refining business.Before Ambani entered the green-energy race in June, Adani was winning it. For years, the Adani Group mined coal, produced coal-fired power at large plants like Mundra in Gujarat and berthed coal vessels at his vast network of ports. When Adani made news on an environmental issue, it was usually for the wrong reason. But in the past three years, the second-richest Asian has swiftly assembled a 20 gigawatt solar, wind and hybrid electricity portfolio. Adani Green Energy shares have risen 13-fold in the past 24 months, feeding the magnate’s ambition to be the world’s largest renewable energy producer by 2030.That won’t be easy now. Ambani is moving quickly to capture 100 gigawatts of solar manufacturing, or a third of India’s market, by the end of the decade. Reliance has bought Norwegian solar panel maker REC Solar Holdings AS for $771 million.The deal, according to brokerage Jefferies, comes with 446 patents and a technology that consumes 75% less power than Chinese rivals. Add that to the purchase of 40% of Sterling & Wilson Solar, a contractor with 3,000 engineering teams putting up renewable-energy farms globally, and you know that Ambani is going to make REC’s panels in Jamnagar and install them wherever the sun shines bright.But sunshine won’t power large swathes of the Indian industrial hinterland. An all-weather, all-purpose alternative to fossil fuel may need to exploit the most abundant atom in the universe — not by extracting hydrogen from methane or coal, but by using some form of renewable energy, like solar or wind, to break down water molecules. That’s where the two titans will clash next.With blockbuster commitments, both billionaires are promising to tap into India’s renewed interest in hydrogen, articulated in August under a vague National Hydrogen Mission. Each businessman, however, only controls certain pieces of the puzzle.Ambani, a huge generator of gray hydrogen — the dirty, cheaper kind produced by refineries to power their own operations and often used by other industrial firms — wants to go green. He’s seeking partners to bring viable technology to India. It’s an expensive undertaking.Currently, green hydrogen is priced between $4 and $6 per kilogram. The cost of production mainly includes capital expenditure on electrolysers — industrial-scale facilities to break down water or other electrolytes into hydrogen molecules — and electricity, which makes up around 30% to 65%. All told, green hydrogen is between two to seven times more expensive than the carbon-intensive gray kind.For hydrogen to become a real option, affordability is key. Luckily, India is a testing ground for making everything cheaper. World-beating pricing lies at the heart of the smartphone data empire Ambani has built up from scratch in six years. The country could make green hydrogen cost competitive with gray by the end of this decade, one of the fastest timelines globally, according to a BloombergNEF analysis. In a speech in September, Ambani talked up a “New Green Revolution,” saying he was sure India could produce hydrogen at “under $1 per 1 kilogram within a decade.” He called it the 1-1-1 target.Ambani’s efforts toward building electrolysers will serve the Reliance empire internally. But to run those electrolysers and make the hydrogen path green, he will need renewable energy. Power supply is where rival Adani is stronger. As one of the world’s largest solar power players, he will have plenty of green electricity. And when it’s time to move hydrogen, Adani’s dominance over transportation could come into play. Late last year, the Adani Group set up a collaboration with Snam SpA, Italy’s natural-gas distribution network.Adani, too, has talked of green hydrogen as a game-changer and wants to build electrolysers. Any plans to capture the entire hydrogen supply chain though would be misguided. Producing the gas, processing, storing and distributing it, and then putting it to use, requires varied expertise. It also needs special handling given its flammability. Rather than trying to do it all — as Adani and Ambani have said they want to — it would be more productive to focus on distinct parts of the value chain, where each billionaire has an advantage.After Ambani’s $10 billion foray into renewables in June, Adani upped the ante, saying he’ll invest twice as much. But as India’s experience with solar shows, producing electricity cheaply isn’t enough. Even with a strong policy push by the federal government, it’s a struggle to make near-bankrupt state distribution utilities honor their long-term power purchase agreements or pay on time.What’s needed is a hydrogen policy that capitalizes on the two tycoons’ eagerness to invest, but prepares the ground for an open network with strong competition that whets demand. Still, it’s unlikely that the two Gujarati entrepreneurs who have so far avoided going head-to-head will be keen to coordinate by putting their pieces of the jigsaw together.For all its potential uses and cost advantages, how Ambani and Adani duke it out on hydrogen will decide if a relatively poor, populous country can contribute to saving the planet — without surrendering its shot at better living standards. Just the question that Glasgow, like the other 25 climate summits before it, will probably fail to answer.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/a-climate-clash-between-two-billionaires-ambani-and-adani-over-hydrogen/articleshow/87467436.cms,2

However, the NCLT has directed that no meeting to be held until final order is pronounced on the applications,” the Future group firms said.Accordingly, the meetings ""are deferred under the directions of the NCLT and would not be conducted as per their earlier respective schedules,” they informed.Earlier on October 11, several listed transferor firms including Future Retail, Future Consumer, Future Enterprises, Future Lifestyle Fashions, Future Markets Networks and Future Supply Chain Solutions - had informed their shareholders and creditors about the proposed meetings on November 10 and 11.The scheme of arrangement between Future and Reliance Retail, announced in August last year entails consolidation of Future Group's 19 companies operating in retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing assets into one entity -- Future Enterprises Ltd.Future Enterprises Ltd is the transferee company to Reliance Retail.The meetings was called as per the order passed by the NCLT on September 28, that had asked Future group to take approval from its shareholders and creditors over the scheme of arrangement.In August last year, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd had said it will acquire the retail and wholesale business, and the logistics and warehousing business of Future Group for Rs 24,713 crore.Amazon is contesting the deal through its shares in FCPL and had approached Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC).On October 2020, an interim award was passed by the EA (emergency arbitrator) in favour of Amazon that barred FRL from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.This was also upheld by SIAC last month and said FRL is a party to the ongoing arbitration between Amazon and Future group in the dispute over sale of its assets to Reliance Retail.Moreover, in a separate filing Future Retail Ltd also informed that it has filed a Special Leave Petition before the Supreme Court against an interim order passed by the High Court of Delhi in an arbitration appeal filed by the company.On Sunday, the independent directors of Future Retail approached the Competition Commission of India (CCI) urging it to revoke the approval it had given to the Amazon Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL) deal in 2019, alleging the e-commerce major of “making false statements before it”.In November 2019, CCI had given its approval for Amazon to acquire a 49 per cent stake in FCL. FCL is a shareholder in Future Retail Ltd.

If the CCI rules against Amazon and revokes the 2019 approval, it could have wide-ranging ramifications on the US firm's ongoing legal battle with Future, people familiar with the case say.That's because Amazon has so far successfully used the 2019 Future unit deal to argue breach of certain contracts when the Indian company announced plans to sell its retail assets to rival Reliance Industries for $3.4 billion last year.Future, which denies any wrongdoing, accuses Amazon of illegally interfering in its business decisions and derailing a potential deal without which it says it will face liquidation.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/amazon-seeks-to-pause-antitrust-review-of-2019-deal-with-future-group-documents-show/articleshow/87900709.cms,1

His $13-billion JSW Group is the latest to announce restructuring moves after Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta and Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries (RIL). The pattern in India, dominated by conglomerates, mirrors the restructuring initiatives of global powerhouses like General Electric, Toshiba and Johnson & Johnson. Jindal’s new renewable power company will inherit all the assets and liabilities of the business and will unlock value for shareholders in the future. Vedanta plans to split into three companies, while RIL seeks to spin off its gasifier business into a separate entity. “It looks like everyone wants to emulate Adani Group stocks and also ride on the IPO craze,” said InGovern founder Shriram Subramanian. “Many of these promoters will come with OFS (offer for sale) at high valuations,” he added. Jindal targets to have a power generation capacity of 20 gigawatts by the end of this decade. Of this, he wants the share of green energy to be 85%, up from the current 30%. The new renewable power company, JSW Energy Neo, will house existing as well as upcoming units in solar, wind and hydrogen.Ahmedabad-based Adani Group had undertaken a restructuring exercise in 2015 to split ports, power, transmission, alternate energy and incubation initiatives into separate entities. Over the last six years, Adani created billions in value, said HDFC Securities research head (retail) Deepak Jasani. The latest restructuring moves by Indian conglomerates follows their recovery from a slump triggered by the pandemic. Separating the business from the main company will sharpen focus and can tailor capital according to requirements. It seems that investors no longer like diversified structures. Earlier, the thinking was that if one business is in a downcycle, then the other would make up for the contraction. There would be some amount of cross-subsidisation. Investors are now of the view that the value of the whole is less than the sum of the parts. Therefore, businesses need to be segregated, Institutional Investor Advisory Services founder Amit Tandon told a business news channel.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/jsw-follows-vedanta-rilwill-rejig-group-structure/articleshow/87918895.cms,2

The rally in Kotak Bank followed RBI’s announcement that promoters of private banks can hold up to 26% in these lenders, thus paving the way for Uday Kotak to raise his stake outside of the central bank’s special nod. The surge in the stock was also boosted by RBI’s nod to life insurance major LIC to raise its stake in the private bank to almost 10%, from below 5% currently, dealers said.Beyond the sensex, however, D-Street witnessed strong selling with the BSE’s midcap index closing nearly 1% lower, and the smallcap index ending nearly 2% down.

I think we are on the right track,"" he said.The comments came as the government looks to bring a new bill in Parliament to treat cryptocurrencies as a financial asset while safeguarding small investors. The legislation may stipulate a minimum amount for investments in digital currencies while banning their use as legal tender.The legislative agenda for the current winter session of Parliament that started on November 29 lists bringing of a bill that seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies except ""certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses.""While the government is considering taxing gains from cryptocurrency, the Reserve Bank of India wants a complete ban on digital currencies as it feels this could affect the nation's macroeconomic and financial stability.""Data and digital infrastructure is strategically important for India and every other nation in the world. Every country has the right to build and protect this strategic digital infrastructure,"" he said adding a uniform global standard was needed so that cross-border transactions, collaborations and partnerships are not hampered.Stating that every citizen's right to privacy has to be safeguarded, he said the right policies and the right regulatory framework have to balance this with the nation's need to guard data and digital infrastructure.Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries Ltd, said that he was a big believer in blockchain technology.""I believe in blockchain technology and this is different from cryptocurrency,"" he said, adding, ""Blockchain is very important for a trust-based, equitable society.""While the bill for regulating cryptocurrency is in the works, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das is among those who feel that the blockchain technology underpinning cryptocurrencies could exist on its own, even without the currency.""Using blockchain, we can deliver unprecedented security, trust, automation and efficiency to almost any type of transaction,"" Ambani said. ""It can be used to modernize our supply chains that form the lifeblood of our economies.""India is now well on its way to transforming itself into a leading Digital Society, having put the digital infrastructure, and the regulatory framework in place.""Data is indeed the 'new oil'. But the new oil is fundamentally different from the traditional oil. Traditional oil was extracted only at select places – thus, it created wealth only for some countries. In contrast, the new oil -- that is data -- can be generated and consumed everywhere and by everybody. It has the potential to create value equitably, across sectors, across geographies, across economic classes,"" he said.His comments come against the backdrop of a debate on how India should balance user protections with support for its digital economy in the world's fastest-growing major internet market. Foreign companies and hundreds of home-grown startups have flourished amid a dearth of regulation.Ambani's Jio has supercharged internet adoption, helping crash data prices since launch in 2016, and his group has now created an online-to-offline retail platform take on the likes of Amazon and Walmart-backed Flipkart, which are both betting big on India's e-commerce market.The country, he said, is transitioning fully from 2G to 4G. ""We are in the process of creating an equally affordable ecosystem of devices to enable greater adoption, supported by a faster rollout of optical fiber, cloud, and data center infrastructure.""The next step will be the connectivity of machines, devices and vehicles, which is the Internet of Things. With 5G rollout next year in India, we are on our way to having one of the most advanced digital infrastructures anywhere in the world.""Ambani said India is well on its way to transforming itself into a leading Digital Society, having put the digital infrastructure, and the regulatory framework in place.""Finance is at the heart of everything, and I believe we are in very early stages of sporadic digitization, and with various new-age technologies emerging, the opportunity is in adopting a decentralised model of finance,"" he said.There will be centralised government and central bank policies, but there will be a path to decentralized technological solutions where finance will be enabled and available to everybody, Ambani said.Real-time technologies will help settle trades, not in days or hours, but in real-time. Smart contracts will become a reality.""Convergence of real-time technologies, distributed ledger, blockchain, smart tokens etc with physical infrastructure using IoT will redefine the decentralized financing sector in a way that we have never imagined,"" he added.

The $736-million green loan is also a rare acquisition financing from RIL, which opted for a term borrowing instead of a short-term bridge facility as is typically employed in most M&A situations, the Refinitiv report added. REC Solar is a 25-year-old company with three manufacturing plants — two in Norway for making solar grade polysilicon, and one in Singapore manufacturing photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules. RIL plans to use REC Solar’s technology in its fully integrated, metallic silicon to PV panel manufacturing giga factory in Jamnagar, Gujarat, initially starting with annual capacity of 4GW and eventually growing to 10GW.After REC Solar, RIL announced a stake-purchase in Mumbai-based Sterling & Wilson Solar. The acquisitions and the green loan mark RIL’s first steps in its goal to become a net carbon zero company by 2035 and make India a hub for low-cost solar manufacturing.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-makes-green-finance-debut-with-736mn-loan/articleshow/88132151.cms,2

In his speech, Ambani touched on the significant role of technology in various walks of life. “Indians have embraced technology with unbridled optimism,” said Ambani. He also shared five ideas that could shape connectivity for the next decade. Here’s what Ambani said:Move to 5G at the earliestAmbani said that India must complete the migration from 2G to 4G to 5G at the earliest. “To keep millions of Indians at the bottom of the socio-economic pyramid confined to 2G is to deprive them of the benefits of the digital revolution,” he said in his keynote speech. 5G should be a “national priority” and Jio is focused on itAmbani spoke about how the rollout of 5G should be India’s national priority and how Jio is focused on 4G and 5G execution and broadband infrastructure expansion. “We have developed a 100% home-grown and comprehensive 5G solution which is fully cloud native and digitally managed,”Affordability and digital inclusion The Reliance Industries chairman said that India should not lose sight of the fact that affordability has been a critical driver of the phenomenally rapid expansion of the mobile subscriber base in India. “India should move towards greater digital exclusion and not greater digital exclusion.” He further said that India needs to ensure affordability not only of services but also of devices and applications. “The best way of ensuring comprehensive affordability is nimble adoption of futuristic technologies and supportive policy tools like use of the USO fund for purposes other than services. USO fund can be used to subsidise devices to select target groups,” he added.Fibre connectivity is criticalAmbani said that India should work on ubiquitous fibre connectivity on a “mission mode.” He said that for India to be future-ready, it has to be fibre-ready. “If all the players in the industry work together, we can rapidly achieve a nationwide footprint of Fibre, just as we reached mobile telephony to every corner of the country in the last decade,” he said. A robust digital ecosystemIt’s time, said Ambani that, beyond connectivity, the focus should be on the critical components of the digital eco-system which are necessary for India’s digital transformation. “We are already seeing innovative solutions in Education, Financial Services, Entertainment, Retail, Agriculture, Manufacturing and other key verticals of the economy,” he added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/5g-fibre-and-more-mukesh-ambanis-5-ideas-on-connectivity-for-the-next-decade/articleshow/88159981.cms,2

Contributions plunged 64% year-on-year to Rs 8,828 crore in fiscal 2021 under CSR, making it the lowest in recent years. In fiscals 2020 and 2019, CSR expenditure was Rs 24,689 crore and Rs 20,150 crore. In 2014, India had mandated companies to spend 2% of their average net profits clocked in the preceding three fiscals on social causes. But the pandemic that set in towards the fag end of fiscal 2020 forced companies to balance their business goals, employee well-being programmes and social obligations. A significant part of their CSR contribution was directed towards fighting the public health crisis, leaving little for other social causes. Companies set up medical infrastructure, established oxygen plants and contributed to Centre & state governments’ Covid relief programmes to counter the pandemic.“Given the expectations of a third Covid wave, the probability of (companies) diverting more funds during this fiscal seems imminent,” Crisil Foundation COO Maya Vengurlekar had said in August. India’s largest conglomerate, the Tata Group, spent nearly Rs 1,000 crore on CSR activities in fiscal 2021, retaining its top position, according to data from ministry of corporate affairs. Reliance Industries followed next, spending Rs 922 crore on social causes. The company, headed by India’s wealthiest man Mukesh Ambani, contributed Rs 561 crore to the Centre and various state governments’ Covid relief programmes. IT major Infosys contributed Rs 362 crore to CSR activities in fiscal 2021, while diversified cigarette-to-cookie maker ITC allocated Rs 335 crore, according to the data.Following the outbreak of Covid, New Delhi has been amending CSR rules by including multiple components into them. It has allowed companies to use CSR funds for setting up Covid care facilities, manufacturing of ventilators and other medical equipment, among other things. “More changes may be in order this fiscal as new rules proposed by the ministry of corporate affairs have kicked in from April 2021. In its notifications, apart from key CSR rules, the ministry has also urged India Inc to support Covid relief work, and awareness & vaccinations drives as part of their ongoing CSR mandate,” Crisil Ratings director Nitesh Jain had also said in August.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/csr-spends-plunge-64-in-fy21/articleshow/88152738.cms,1

While the parties didn’t reveal their equity component in the joint venture, this will be RIL’s first investment in a greenfield petchem project outside of India. The petchem facility in Abu Dhabi’s Al Ruwais city, targeted to be operational by 2025, will produce chlor-alkali, ethylene dichloride and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Chlor-alkali enables the production of caustic soda, crucial to the alumina refining process. Ethylene dichloride is used to produce PVC, which has a wide range of applications across housing, infrastructure and consumer goods. The Abu Dhabi facility will have a capacity to produce 9.4 lakh tons of chlor-alkali annually, 1.1 million tons of ethylene dichloride and 3.6 lakh tons of PVC. The petchem project was initiated based on the demand potential for these products. In 2019, RIL and Abu Dhabi had signed a framework to explore joint investments in petchem. The unit will create export opportunities to Southeast Asia and Africa, as well as provide local industry with a source of critical raw materials manufactured in the UAE, the companies added. The $74-billion RIL and Abu Dhabi have a long relationship, with the former sourcing crude oil from the emirate for many years. Abu Dhabi had also invested in RIL’s retail and telecom (Jio) businesses. The Abu Dhabi project will be the first investment by RIL in the Middle East and North Africa region, the Indian company said. In 2012, RIL had purchased BP’s petchem unit in Malaysia for $230 million. RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said, “India’s need for PVC to propel its growth, and the value from the abundantly available feedstock in UAE, provides a win-win partnership for all the companies.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-abu-dhabi-cos-tie-up-for-2bn-petchem-plant-in-uae/articleshow/88152886.cms,0

The alliance will also explore low-carbon solutions. Mahindra Group and its channel partners’ locations will be evaluated for setting up Jio-BP stations, including EV charging and swapping points. Additionally, business models like Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) and Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) will be explored wherein Jio-BP could provide charging solutions to EVs made by Mahindra Group. Jio-BP recently launched its first station in Maharashtra, offering multiple fuelling choices, including EV-charging infrastructure.India’s EV market, though nascent, is red hot right now. With companies like Ola, Greaves and most recently Simple Energy setting up large e-two-wheeler plants (Ola and Simple are both million-plus factories), the supply side is ramping up fast. It’s the charging infrastructure though that’s going to be a game changer. According to a Grant Thornton Charat-Ficci report released earlier this year, the estimate was that India would need 400,000 charging stations by 2026 to accommodate 2 million EVs. According to the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles, there were around 1,800 charging stations as of March this year for just over 16,000 electric four-wheelers.88177888 Because the demand is so high, the activity is beginning to get frenetic too at the charging end. Tata Power and its leverage with Tata Motors’s EV business has been one of the reasons for the success of the latter’s EV strategy. In the two-wheeler space, Tata Power has also partnered with TVS for charging network. Ashok Leyland has signed an MoU with ABB Power Grids to set up fast-charging infrastructure for electric buses. Traditional oil companies are already ramping up their EV-charging network riding on their petrol/diesel channels. Indian Oil, which currently has 448 charging stations, plans to ramp up to 2,000 in a year and add another 8,000 in a further 2 years. In the two-wheeler space, vehicle manufacturers are setting up their own network, taking a leaf out of the dealer-channel build that ICE OEMs do. Ola, for instance, is investing heavily in its hyper charger network and has announced it will have 100,000 charging points across 400 cities. Rival Hero Electric has announced it will set up 10,000 charging stations by 2022.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mm-jio-bp-tie-up-for-ev-services/articleshow/88173368.cms,2

The conglomerate aims to get about a 500,000 barrels cargo of United Arab Emirates' Das crude from RINL, said the source, who is not authorised to speak to media.Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), which has leased part of the strategic petroleum reserve at Mangalore in southern India, supplied 1 million barrels of Das crude from the cavern to Reliance in October and 2 million barrels in November, data from trade sources show.India has allowed ADNOC to trade oil from the cavern.This month, Indian refiners are snapping up February-loading Middle Eastern sour crude after spot premiums halved from the multi-month highs seen for January-lifting cargoes, trade sources said.There are more supplies from the Atlantic Basin, while the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, decided earlier this month to continue increasing output by 400,000 barrels per day in January.Reliance has bought 4 million barrels of Das crude for February loading at premiums of about $2 to $2.30 a barrel to Dubai quotes, trade sources said, down from premiums of more than $5 in the previous month.Italy's Eni is supplying 1.5 million barrels, while PetroChina has sold 1 million barrels, they said.

Ambani's twin children, Akash and Isha gave a preview of the ordering at Meta's second edition of the Fuel for India event on Wednesday.  A new 'tap and chat' option allows users to order groceries through WhatsApp. Delivery is free and there is no minimum order value. Customer can fill their shopping carts within the app and pay either via JioMart or in cash on delivery.  ""The JioMart experience through WhatsApp is actually, very simply put - 'conversational' in nature. WhatsApp is extremely simple and easy to use; So there's no customer inhibition when ordering for supplies,"" said Akash.  It's extremely intuitive - so there are no barriers to technology. ""And digital shopping is now just an extension of messaging via WhatsApp to JioMart, it's all taken care of in a couple of steps effortlessly.""  Isha said all a customer needs to do is just order away on JioMart.  ""Bread, butter, vegetables, beverages, everything that you need in your household that day or that week... look up a product, set up a subscription for a regular buy if that's what you want, or get personalized recommendations based on your past purchase history, it's all there,"" she said.  Facebook, now known as Meta, in April last year invested $5.7 billion for a 9.99 per cent in Jio Platforms, the digital and telecom arm of Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd.  The partnership was aimed at connecting over 400 million WhatsApp users and half a million retailers that Reliance has on its network. And playing a catalyst is cheap data that 425 million subscribers of Reliance Jio get.  The orders are executed using the network of Reliance Retail, the biggest brick-and-mortar store chain.  Also, repaid users of Reliance Jio can recharge using WhatsApp.  ""As Jio and Meta teams work closely, we are opening more and more avenues of working together. One such avenue is Jio on WhatsApp, which is simplifying the entire 'prepaid recharge',"" Akash said.  This, he said, will bring consumers convenience like they've never had before.  ""Yes, it makes it very simple for anybody to adopt. For example, for older citizens who at times may find it difficult to head outside, this Jio recharge feature through WhatsApp is so helpful! And payments on WhatsApp adds to that ease!"" Isha said.  Akash said it is really exciting how the end-to-end experience for Recharge through WhatsApp along with the ability to make payments can potentially make the lives of millions of Jio subscribers much more convenient.  JioMart delivers from fruits and vegetables to cereal, toothpaste and cooking staples like panner and chickpea flour ordered through WhatsApp.  Food and groceries account for nearly half of India's retail spending, which is projected to reach as much as $1.3 trillion by 2025, according to Boston Consulting Group.  Interconnected to the entire scheme is Jio's low-priced smartphone that it is offering in association with Google. The phone comes preloaded with the JioMart and WhatsApp apps.  Last year, Google invested $4.5 billion for a 7.73 per cent stake in Jio Platforms Ltd.  ""We believe that small businesses are the bedrock of our country's economic backbone. The pandemic really brought home the truth that small merchant shops, retailers, and small businesses urgently needed to convert their physical brick and mortar stores to digital storefronts,"" Isha said.  The partnership with Meta allowed to quickly leverage the strength of the WhatsApp platform that provides access to over 400 million people.  ""With an equal number of Jio subscribers it seemed like a natural progression for us to be able to support these businesses not only through a digital connection with their customers online, but also to quickly develop and build very specific digital-commerce solutions,"" she said.  Akash said JioMart currently has over half a million retailers and is growing every day. ""We were very clear that the JioMart's unmatched network - both in online and offline retail should be leveraged optimally, given the size of the opportunity.""  ""We continue to be so excited about our partnership with Meta and in collaboration with the WhatsApp team, we intend to build out native features that will not only help users shop seamlessly on WhatsApp but will also help retailers increase stock assortments, improve margins and get them closer to perhaps a larger base of customers, like never before.

The sector lost its position last year to consumer & retail, which came in at third position this year with Rs 12.5 lakh crore. Technology occupied the second position by adding Rs 15.2 lakh crore.""The Financials sector has regained its top spot in Wealth Creation, after briefly losing it in the previous study period to Consumer & Retail. The sector has also gained significant share of Wealth Creation – almost 25% of total Wealth created v/s 18% five years ago,"" said the study.Two big losers in terms of share of Wealth Creation are autos and pharma.The top 100 companies in India’s equity markets created Rs 71 lakh crore in wealth during the five years from 2016 to 2021.This was the highest wealth created in the past 26 five-year periods. The pace of wealth creation was also higher at a compound annual growth rate of 25 percent vis-à-vis 14 percent for the BSE Sensex.The previous best period in terms of wealth creation was 2014-19, when the markets generated Rs 49 lakh crore of wealth for investors.Over 2016-21, Adani Transmission was the fastest wealth creator with a price CAGR of 93 percent during 2016-21. Another Adani Group company – Adani Enterprises – was ranked the third fastest wealth creator with a price CAGR of 86 percent. Adani Enterprises also emerged as the most consistent wealth creator in the past five years with the highest price CAGR of 86 percent.According to the study, Rs 10 lakh invested equally in 2016 among the top 10 fastest wealth creators would have grown to Rs 1.7 crore in 2021 — a return CAGR of 77 per cent versus just 14 per cent for the Sensex.“Eight out of top 10 fastest wealth creators had a market cap below Rs 2,000 crore in 2016. Further, most of them were reasonably valued then, especially relative to their growth prospects. Thus, the data confirms the obvious — for high wealth creation, pick small-to-mid companies with robust earnings growth prospects trading at reasonable valuations,” the report observed.The wealth created by public sector undertakings during 2016-21 was the worst ever, with only two PSUs, Gujarat Gas and Indraprastha Gas, featuring in the list. These two contributed to less than 1 per cent of the total wealth generated.""Following the Air India model, the government is better off privatizing as many PSUs as it can.

Kanubhai Desai, state finance and education minister when contacted confirmed the plans for bringing new green hydrogen energy policy. “Globally green hydrogen energy generation is being seen as the answer to climate change mitigation,” he said. In his latest Independence Day speech on August 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had stressed upon the importance of India to transform into a hydrogen-based economy while flagging the launch of the National Hydrogen Mission. Many companies have started making the switch as a result. Some of the companies that have started work in this direction include Reliance Industries Ltd, Adani group, L&T, NTPC, GAIL and IOC, among others.The government aims to offer major financial incentives for research & development and human resources incentives also.

The 30-share index jumped 635.96 points or 1.14 per cent to 56,457.97 in the opening trade. Similarly, the Nifty advanced 187.05 points or 1.13 per cent to 16,801.25. HCL Tech was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rising around 3 per cent, followed by Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel, Wipro, NTPC and Titan. On the other hand, Axis Bank was the sole loser. In the previous session, the 30-share equity benchmark crashed 1,189.73 points or 2.90 per cent to end at 55,822.01, and Nifty tanked 371 points or 2.18 per cent to 16,614.20. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net sellers in the capital market, as they sold shares worth Rs 3,565.36 crore on Monday, according to stock exchange data. The negative sentiments caused by the global sell-off triggered by the explosive growth of the Omicron variant may persist in the short run. Sustained FII selling (above Rs 30,000 crore for December, so far) continues to be a major headwind for the market, said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. However, it is important to note that FIIs are booking profits rather than selling indiscriminately in India. From November 1st to 15th December FIIs sold bank stocks worth Rs 19,442 crore. They have been sitting on big profits on bank stocks, which they accumulated during 2015-20. So, profit booking makes sense, he stated. ""FIIs are not indiscriminately selling India and will turn buyers when they see the value. Meanwhile, DIIs are spotting value and accumulating stocks in many beaten down segments,"" he added. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul were trading with gains in mid-session deals. Stock exchanges in the US ended in the red in the overnight session.

Reliance Industries and financial stocks led the decline. In mid-session, the sensex was down nearly 1,900 points, but a pull-back rally helped it close at 55,822 — a loss of 1,190 points or 2.1%. The day’s close was a fourth-month low for the sensex.Last week, the US Fed had said it would end its bond-buying programme, which was started in early 2020, by March 2022. The US central bank added that it would raise interest rates at least thrice next year, from almost zero level now. Also last week, in a surprise move, the BoE raised interest rate. This left investors around the globe jittery as the decision could lead to a situation of competing increase of rates among countries. Combined with it, the fast spread of the Omicron variant and its impact on markets and economies around the globe is making investors cautious, market players said. 88401071According to Kotak Securities head (equity research - retail) Shrikant Chouhan, the selloff in the domestic market “continued across the spectrum on weak global cues weighed down by factors such as rising Omicron cases in the West, rate hikes by several central banks in Europe and the US Fed also signalling its intent to undertake rate hikes next year to cool down inflationary concerns”. The short-term outlook for the market is still negative but, due to the oversold situation, there is a strong possibility of a meaningful pull-back rally, he said.The day’s selloff left investors poorer by nearly Rs 7 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 255.5 lakh crore. At the current level, India’s mcap is about Rs 18 lakh crore off its all-time high level of Rs 273 lakh crore, official data showed. The slide in investors’ wealth has come despite several new listings in the recent months like Nykaa, Paytm and Policybazaar, which have together added over Rs 4 lakh crore to BSE’s mcap.Like in the last few weeks, Monday’s selling was again led by foreign funds that recorded a net outflow of Rs 3,565 crore. So far in the month, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have net sold stocks worth over Rs 19,100 crore, data from CDSL and BSE showed. Tuesday could witness another session of losses as the leading markets in the US opened deep in the red. The government bond market also saw strong selling on Monday with the benchmark 10-year gilt yield closing at 6.44%, a 21-month high, bond dealers said. The selloff came amid rising concerns about inflation, they said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-sinks-1200-pts-on-global-selloff-over-omicron/articleshow/88399232.cms,1

Considering the importance of its location, the proposed Global City would not only be a unique business hub of the but also of the country,” he added.The project would have huge towers as the permissible FAR would be 3.5 for this hub. There will total four towers in the proposed project and the expected height would be around 60-70 floors. Excluding the industries, the project will have residential, commercial and service sector buildings. It would be developed in such a way that all the basic amenities would be provided underground.Sources said that in the first phase, the project would be developed on 50-100 acres and the expected per acre cost would be around Rs 55 crore. The tender process to allot the work before auctioning the area would be done with next 30 days. Sources in the department said that these state-of-the-art projects would not only be commercial hubs of the state but would also revenue generators for the debt-ridden HSIIDC.Dushyant also informed that HSIIDC has around 208 acre land in Manesar on which the department is planning to develop a theme park and that expression of interest would be invited from the global companies for its development. He claimed that the financial condition of the HSIIDC has improved in the past few years and now the target is to make it a profit-making company.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/haryanas-business-capital-to-get-1k-acre-global-city/articleshow/88602450.cms,2

The Singapore tribunal on December 30 refused to consider Future’s request for terminating the arbitration before starting a final hearing later this week, prompting the retailer to move the Delhi court. If successful, the latest attempt by Future Retail can end the arbitration case that had blocked the sale of some of its physical assets like stores and warehouses to Reliance Industries. Future Retail is coming under increasing pressure from investors, with its dollar bonds on Monday dropping the most since November 16 after it missed payments to lenders and its credit rating was downgraded.A halt or termination of the arbitration case would be a setback for Amazon, which is in a race with Reliance to dominate India’s billion-plus consumer market.The Delhi high court on Monday agreed to hear Future group firms’ petition after one of its lawyers Mukul Rohatgi cited “immense urgency” in the matter during an online hearing. Future Retail contends that continuing arbitration would be illegal as Amazon’s 2019 deal, on the basis of which the arbitration was initiated, has no legal existence after the antitrust body’s order suspended its approval, according people familiar with the filing. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) had last month said the deal will “remain in abeyance.” It fined Amazon Rs 202 crore saying the e-tailer failed to disclose that the deal would give Amazon a right in Future Retail.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/future-retail-petitions-delhi-hc-to-abort-amazon-arbitration/articleshow/88662677.cms,1

As a result, the BSE’s financial, banking and metal indices closed with gains of over 2%, while the healthcare index closed marginally lower.According to Rahul Sharma of Equity99 Advisors, the expectation on the street is that the positive momentum would continue for a while. “However, investors are advised to keep some capital aside to take advantage of any major dips considering the rising Omicron infections. The pharma sector could be a great bet looking at the current scenario,” he said.The day’s session also made investors richer by about Rs 2.5 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 272.5 lakh crore. In the near term, the stock market is expected to witness some up-move, supported mainly by local investors — both institutional and individual.

RIL has obtained board approval for raising $5 billion in unsecured dollar bonds over multiple tranches to refinance existing borrowings. Telecom arm Reliance Jio Infocomm too is planning to replace costly debt with a Rs 5,000-crore rupee bond sale.In the US, 10-year treasuries saw yields rise by over 13 basis points on the first day of trading, while rates in India are also inching up as the RBI drains surplus liquidity from money markets.On Tuesday, Moody’s assigned a Baa2 rating to RIL’s proposed $5-billion fund-raise. The company is raising funds from global institutional investors taking advantage of Section 144A of the US Securities Act, which allows an exemption for offers and sales to large ‘qualified institutional buyers’ in the US. RIL’s adjusted net debt/operating profit was estimated at around 1.1x as of September 30, 2021.Reliance Jio Infocomm is looking to raise Rs 5,000 crore through five-year bonds at less than 50 basis points(100bps = 1 percentage point) over the current yield on 5-year government bonds, which is 5.8%. Last year, the telecom unit had repaid most of its high-cost debt after raising equity funds from several private equity investors. Now, the company is again looking at making large investments to roll out 5G services.Bankers say that although yields have hardened it is a good time to lock into long-term rates as the RBI is widely expected to start hiking its rates after April. Reliance Industries did not comment on its fund-raising plans.The group began the new year with Reliance Industries announcing that its solar unit will buy UK-based sodium-ion battery technology provider Faradion for $135 million as part of its push into the renewable energy segment.In the petrochemicals business, Reliance Industries had last month said that it would partner with Abu Dhabi Chemicals Derivatives Company RSC (TA'ZIZ) and invest $2 billion in setting up a petrochemical production facility in the UAE.According to Moody’s, Reliance Industries’s existing cash, along with expected cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to cover its cash outflows for capital spending and debt maturities in the next 18 months. Last November, it received around Rs 266 billion in proceeds from the final call on its rights issue, which further enhanced its liquidity.Reliance Industries has diversified earnings sources with little or no correlation, given its presence in the refining and petrochemicals, digital services, and consumer retail segments. These three segments together generated around Rs 944 billion ($12.6 billion) or 86% of RIL’s consolidated operating profit for the 12 months ended September 30, 2021.The company’s announcement to increase tariffs for its digital services business is positive for the telecommunications industry, while the easing of pandemic-related disruptions will support demand for oil and gas as well as increase consumer spending. “A resurgence of coronavirus infections due to the emergence of new variants could result in fresh lockdowns and affect the company’s refining & petrochemical and retail earnings,” Moody’s said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-jio-eye-mega-borrowings-to-lock-into-low-interest-rates/articleshow/88697832.cms,0

The rising number of new Covid infections daily across the country, which could potentially derail the slow and fragile economic revival process, is also making market players nervous.On Wednesday night, the Dow Jones index witnessed a late selloff while the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed over 3% down. On Thursday, Nikkei in Japan closed nearly 3% off while the FTSE in the UK was down nearly 1% in late sessions. In early trades in the US, most leading indices were down between 0.4% and 1%. Analysts and market players said the US Fed’s hawkish statement could mean a faster end to its easy-money policy, which in turn could lead to some selling by foreign funds in emerging market economies that include India. End of the session data on the BSE showed that in Thursday’s market, foreign funds were net sellers at Rs 1,927 crore — the first such net outflow figure in 2022.According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, rising Covid cases and stricter restrictions being imposed too contributed to the negative sentiment in the market. “Global markets witnessed a selloff after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s meeting pointed to a faster-than-expected rise in interest rates due to concerns about persistent inflation. (In 2022), the focus of central bankers across the world has shifted towards inflation and monetary policy normalisation since the pandemic, given the context of US Fed tapering and potential hardening of interest rates (during the year),” Khemka wrote in a post-market note.In the next few weeks, a host of factors would decide the market’s path, market players said. These include potential risks from the spread of the Omicron variant, the upcoming Budget in less than a month, earnings momentum and also the macro-economic data — from India and from other developed countries.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-falls-621-points-on-hawkish-us-fed-omicron/articleshow/88742208.cms,1

It raised $1.5 billion in a 10-year ,"MUMBAI: Reliance Industries (RIL) has raised $4 billion in the biggest foreign currency bond sale by an Indian corporate. It raised $1.5 billion in a 10-year tranche, $1.75 billion in a 30-year and $750 million in a 40-year deal. It had recently received board approval to raise up to $5 billion in foreign bonds to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and to refinance existing borrowings. The bond issue was subscribed nearly three times with peak order book aggregating $11.5 billion. The bonds were bought by investors from Asia (53%), America (33%) and Europe (14%). It was the largest foreign currency bond issuance from India, RIL claimed, dwarfing the earlier record set by energy major ONGC Videsh when it raised $2.2 billion in dollars notes in 2014. Bharti Airtel had raised $1.25 billion in 2021, which was the biggest debt issue last year. 88747340The jumbo foreign currency bond issue was the largest debt capital market transaction at $4 billion and the “tightest credit spreads across each of the long-dated tenors for any corporate in India”, said RIL joint chief financial officer Srikanth Venkatachari. “The support received from the marquee international capital market investors is reflective of the strength of our underlying businesses with established growth platforms across energy, consumer and technology as well as robustness of our balance sheet.”RIL did not divulge the name of the subscribers of the bonds. But, industry sources said the subscribers included Fidelity, Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco), Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM), Metlife, Eastspring, NeubergerBerman, Blackrock and Lombard Odier. The bonds will be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Industry observers said RIL achieved a low interest rate as investors are betting on the India growth story, among other factors. “Despite heavy competing calendar at the beginning of the year, RIL printed the lowest ever 30-year coupon and the lowest ever reoffer spread on a 10-year bond from an Indian issuer,” said Bank of America India head Kaku Nakhate.Agreeing with Nakhate was Citi India CEO Ashu Khullar. “RIL achieved lowest coupon for benchmark 30- and 40-year issuances by any private sector corporate in BBB space from Asia, ex-Japan. This is also the first ever 40-year issuance from India taking advantage of current low-rate environment to elongate debt maturity,” said Khullar.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rils-4bn-foreign-currency-bonds-issue-is-indias-biggest/articleshow/88742284.cms,0

The cost of borrowing for the government, as reflected in the yield on 10-year bonds, rose to more than the home loan rates offered by most banks to a two-year high of 6.59%. While Union Bank of India’s loans start at 6.4%, Bank of Baroda is offering them at 6.5%.Bond prices have an inverse relationship with yields, so one falls even as the other rises. In equities, the markets opened strong, tracking Asian stocks and closed higher on expectations that there would be a pro-growth Budget. The Nifty, too, scaled 18,000 to close 1.1% higher at 18,003. However, analysts forecast volatility as the Omicron variant continues to spread rapidly. The rupee rallied to a two-month high bolstered by inflows. The domestic currency closed stronger at 74.04, up from Friday’s close of 74.31 against the dollar — the highest since November 9. A record fund-raise by Reliance Industries and other capital inflows are expected to keep the dollar under check.Bond markets, however, saw a selloff. The 6.59% yield on the 10-year bond is the highest since January 31, 2020. The benchmark 10-year bond had closed at 6.54% on Friday. Sentiment in the bond market has changed after the RBI became a net seller of bonds — a move seen aimed at supporting measures to normalise the excess liquidity pumped in to help markets during the pandemic. Bond yields rose ahead of December inflation numbers, which are expected on Wednesday. Dealers also have a negative outlook on inflation with global oil prices firming up over concerns of supply constraints because of geopolitical tension in Libya and Kazakhstan. Additionally, bond yields rose because of a surge in US yields. A drop in unemployment in the US is expected to prompt the Federal Reserve to hike rates earlier than expected.In domestic market, the sensex opened stronger. Bank stocks were among key gainers. During the day, there were rumours that the government might hike foreign investment limit in public sector banks to 74%. SBI gained the most (2.5%) on anticipation of better Q3 results.

The US company's position has so far been backed by the Singapore arbitrator and Indian courts. Future denies any wrongdoing.But after the CCI suspended that deal's approval, saying Amazon suppressed information while seeking clearances for the deal, Future has argued Amazon no longer has any legal basis to pursue the dispute.Both of Amazon's appeals, to the tribunal and Supreme Court, are likely to be heard in coming days, two of the sources said.

Future denies any wrongdoing.Future told exchanges this month it was unable to pay Rs 3,500 crore ($470 million) it owed to its lenders on December 31 as it could not sell certain small stores due to the dispute with Amazon. It had hoped to use a 30-day grace period to resolve the situation.Beyond that, banks are bound by law to classify Future's accounts as a ""non-performing asset"", or an NPA, and declare it as a defaulter, further complicating the financial position of the debt-laden company.The sources said Future was readying an approach to the Supreme Court within days to urge judges to stop its lenders from taking any drastic steps and extend timelines to allow it to sell its small stores and clear its dues.Future's 1,700 outlets include roughly 900 small-sized stores, with the rest being large-format hypermarkets and fashion outlets.Further, Future is also likely to ask judges to direct the country's central bank to extend the 30-day regulatory grace period and ask the lenders to not declare it as an NPA for the time being, one of the sources said.The sources declined to be identified as the plans are not public. The lead bankers to Future, State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Bank of India, and the RBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Future also did not respond.Future's plans signal growing distress at the retail group, which has said it fears liquidation and more than 27,000 job losses at its main retail arm, Future Retail, if its asset sale plan to rival Reliance Industries fails.One banker who has exposure to Future said lenders will be forced to make financial provisions in their books in line with regulations if Future does not pay up by the end of January, unless there ""is a legal angle and a court gives an order to put a hold on it.""Amazon has long argued that Future violated the terms of a 2019 deal they had signed when the US firm invested $200 million in a Future unit.

EBITDA at Rs 13,530 crore was up 6.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter and 38.7 per cent year-on-year.Consolidated revenue of the nation's biggest company by market value rose 9.5 per cent over the previous three months and 52.2 per cent year-on-year to Rs 209,823 crore. In terms of quarter-on-quarter growth, RIL's profit jumped 35.59 per cent from Rs 13,680 crore posted in previous quarter ending September 2021. The company's revenue from operations came in at Rs 1.91 lakh crore in the period under consideration from Rs 1.24 lakh crore a year back. Reliance's retail business rode a boom in consumer demand, with the lifting of most Covid-19 restrictions toward the end of 2021, while higher refining margins and improved price realizations bolstered its mainstay energy business.Reliance recorded a one-off gain of Rs 2,872 crore from the sale of its shale gas assets.""Retail business activity has normalized with strong growth in key consumption baskets on the back of festive season and as lockdowns eased across the country,"" Ambani said in a statement.""The recovery in global oil and energy markets supported strong fuel margins and helped our O2C (oil-to-chemicals)business deliver robust earnings.""RIL's telecom arm Jio Infocomm post nearly 10 per cent jump in profit at Rs 3,615 crore as against Rs 3,291 crore posted in same quarter last year.Jio's subscriber base grew, helped by its budget smartphone Jiophone Next. It added 10.2 million subscribers in Q3FY22.Segment EBIDTA crossed Rs 10,000 crore mark for the first time.Meanwhile, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd's EBITDA rose to Rs 3,822 crore as demand improved across categories during the festive season. Net profit from retail business rose 23.4 per cent to Rs 2,259 crore.The growth was supported by retail demand in jewellery, electronics and grocery. Also, lower restrictions on mobility and higher operating days during the quarter were other drivers of the retail segment's sales.It opened 837 new stores during the quarter, taking the total count to 14,412 stores. Revenue crossed the Rs 50,000 crore mark for the first time, rising above pre-pandemic levels.Reliance's oil and gas segment posted a near 500 per cent YoY spurt in revenues to Rs 2,559 crore, with segment EBITDA of Rs 2,033 crore. This is on the back of production from newer fields in the KG-D6 block stabilising, taking the overall production to 18 million standard cubic metres per day.But the full impact of its recent tariff hike will be visible in the fourth quarter (January-March).RIL's share finished marginally lower at Rs 2,478 on the BSE, while it closed at Rs 2,476.05 on the NSE.(With inputs from agencies) ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/markets/quarterly-results/reliance-industries-q3-net-profit-jumps-41-5-to-rs-18549-crore/articleshow/89044483.cms,0

This is because there were still some pandemic-related restrictions in some regions of the country in 1HFY22.""We expect the recovery to continue through to 4QFY22, subject to the risk of a resurgence in Covid-19 cases and the resultant impact on economic activity and mobility,"" it said.In its 'India Oil & Gas Watch' report, the rating agency said capex is likely to stay high as oil marketing companies (OMCs) expand their refining capacity and retail networks, and upstream companies enhance production.""We expect stable crude oil production, which should marginally increase in FY23 as upstream producers continue to invest in exploration and development,"" it said.India's natural gas production increased by 22% yoy in April-December 2021 and the momentum is likely to continue over the next 12-18 months, driven by expanded production at new fields, before stabilising in FY23.""We believe rising domestic production and higher liquefied natural gas (LNG) spot prices are likely to weigh on LNG imports through to 1HFY23. However, LNG imports should rise steadily over the medium-term as consumption picks up pace,"" it said.Core oil refining margins are likely to improve in 2HFY22 (October 2021 to March 2022), as petrol and diesel spreads continue to strengthen amid the economic recovery. The 1HFY22 (April-September 2021) reported margins of BPCL, IOC and HPCL improved to $5.1 per barrel, $6.6 and $2.9 a barrel, respectively, on account of rebounding demand, wider gasoline spreads and inventory gains.""We expect the OMCs to generate steady marketing margins in 2HFY22, as they continue to pass on higher crude oil prices to consumers,"" Fitch said.""Government cuts to gasoline (petrol) and gasoil (diesel) excise duties, as well as to value-added tax in some states, should cushion retail fuel-price affordability and the OMCs' marketing margins.""However, record-high retail fuel prices may limit the extent to which the changes are passed on should the crude oil prices continue to rise, it said.India's crude oil production declined by 3% year-on-year in April-December 2021, while natural gas production rose by 22%.The steep rise in gas output was due to a production ramp-up at the KG-DWN-98/2 and KG-D6 deepwater projects. Natural gas production to further increase over the next 12-18 months, driven by expanding production at the new fields, before stabilising in FY23.""Crude oil production should stay stable in 4QFY22, before marginally increasing as upstream producers continue to invest in exploration and development and enhance existing facilities to offset the natural decline from mature fields,"" Fitch said.The government increased the domestic gas price at the last October 2021-March 2022 reset to $2.9 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), from an all-time low of $1.8 in April 2021-September 2021.The price is linked to prices of four global liquefied natural gas (LNG) benchmarks, including Henry Hub and National Balancing Point, in the previous 12 months and is implemented with a quarter's lag.Global gas prices rose during 2021 and we expect global prices to stay high in 1Q22, driven by high demand in Asia, production bottlenecks and uncertainty around Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline as well as limited gas in European storage facilities.This is likely to result in higher domestic gas prices during 1HFY23, helping boost profitability at upstream companies. However, the impact on upstream companies will be marginal, due to its low share in the revenue mix, Fitch said.The government's higher price ceiling for gas produced from deepwater and other difficult fields of $6.13 per mmBtu, from $3.62, is likely to benefit production at Reliance Industries Ltd's Krishna Godavari basin field.

They want to know if Amazon can act on behalf of Samara Capital and has the authority to negotiate and finalise such transaction on its behalf.Speaking to PTI, Ravindra Dhariwal, an independent director of Future Retail Ltd (FRL) said if Amazon wants to help FRL, it needs to show the structure through which it will put the money.""We cannot accept the offer until and unless it is legally valid and unless it comes in time. What is the point of giving an offer after ‘chidiya chug gayi khet'...If you want to help, then show us the structure through which you will put the money and we have asked you in good faith to put in Rs 3,500 crore now so that we can repay the bank and the company is not treated as NPA and is not liable to IBC,” he said.Amazon told FRL that Samara Capital remains interested in buying out the debt-strapped retailer's businesses such as Big Bazaar for Rs 7,000 crore, and had asked FRL to provide its financial details to Samara Capital for the private equity fund to conduct expedited due diligence.Dhariwal expressed concern that the support being extended is more of publicity.“They just do not have a tenable structure, neither do they have a viable structure. The issue is very simple. We owe money to the banks, bondholders and vendors,” he said.Asked if Samara has directly reached out to the independent directors, Dhariwal answered in the negative.“We, the independent directors, have never heard about Samara. We have no idea they are interested, why they want to do it. We, independent directors, have never talked to Samara. Samara has discussed the terms sheet with the promoters of Big Bazaar with Biyani brother and they have acknowledged the term sheet, but not supported the term sheets. It is one of the 2-3 term sheets which they (FRL) have got. They never discussed it with us and never made it to the Board because they (Biyanis) found it inadequate,” he said.Samara Capital had, in June 2020, signed a non-binding term sheet to acquire FRL's businesses including Big Bazaar, Easyday and Heritage among other chains for Rs 7,000 crore.While Amazon is opposed to billionaire Mukesh Ambani's group acquiring businesses of FRL along with other group companies for Rs 24,713 crore, it seemed from the letter that it was open to Samara Capital taking over the business.The Amazon letter, a copy of which was seen by PTI, asserted that the engagement with Samara will not affect the binding nature of the injunctions passed in the Arbitration Proceedings and by Indian Courts over transfer/encumbrance of FRL's retail assets.It said the new transaction will have the understanding that “the transaction with the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (Reliance Industries Limited) group (MDA Group) will not proceed and not be acted upon; and all assistance would be done through legally compliant structures”.Amazon had argued that the structure with Samara in place is also similar to the proposed acquisition of the retail and wholesale undertaking of the Future group (which includes FRL's retail assets) by Reliance Retail and Fashion Lifestyle Ltd (RRFLL).Future and Amazon have been locked in a bitter legal tussle after the US e-commerce giant dragged Future Group to arbitration at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in October 2020, arguing that FRL had violated their contract by entering into a deal for the sale of its assets to billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Retail on a slump sale basis.Earlier this month, Future Retail had said it had missed the due date for payment of Rs 3,494.56 crore to banks and lenders as it could not sell assets due to its ongoing litigation with Amazon, impacting its monetisation plans.Notably, in December, fair trade regulator Competition Commission of India (CCI) had suspended the 2019 approval for Amazon's deal to acquire a 49-per cent stake in Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL), FRL's promoter, while slapping a penalty of Rs 202 crore on the e-commerce major.The CCI order has been challenged by Amazon before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, which has issued notice to the fair trade regulator and FCPL. The NCLAT has directed to list the matter on February 2 for the next hearing.

However, some buying at lower levels in the closing hour helped the index to close at 57,492, down 1,546 points on the day. A rumour about a hike in long term capital gains tax rate in the Budget, which was later denied by the government, also added to investors' nervousness, market players said.In the last five sessions, the sensex has lost nearly 4,000 points, from its recent closing high at 61,309 on January 17. One of the main reasons for this slide is the selling by select foreign funds, market players said.89105419 If interest rates in the world's leading economies go up to rein in inflation, that would make getting money expensive and hence these fund managers are taking some money off risky emerging markets, including India, analysts said.Recent data bolsters this logic. Monday's selling was led by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) with a net outflow at Rs 3,752 crore, that took the month's net withdrawal figure to about Rs 15,000 crore or $2 billion, BSE and CDSL data showed.Institutional sales people, who interact with foreign and domestic fund managers on a daily basis on behalf of brokers, said that a large part of the current selling is by hedge funds and ETFs while long-term investors like insurance companies and pension funds are not bearish on India, and hence not selling aggressively.The day's selling left investors poorer by nearly Rs 9 lakh crore with BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 264 lakh crore. On a year-to-date basis, investors are poorer by Rs 5.3 lakh crore, official data showed.Despite the sharp sell-off, there are analysts who are assuring investors that the current sell-off is expected to ebb in the next two-three sessions. According to Harendra Kumar, MD, Elara Securities India, in December the sensex had seen a low at below 56k mark and we are yet to reach there. ""Yet, investors are much nervous now mainly because there is a shift in investors' preference from growth stocks to value stocks,"" he said.What this means is that investors globally, including in India, are shifting from those companies with high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to reasonably lower P/E numbers. In India, stocks like Zomato and PayTM are growth stocks while companies like Reliance Industries, Maruti, ICICI Bank, etc, are value stocks. ""There is a perceptible shift in investor preference"" from growth to value stocks, he said. ""The going for the high P/E stocks in the short run would be slightly challenging.""Market players also said that compared to in the US where technology stocks have a huge weight in the indices and are being hammered, in India, similar tech-enabled companies have almost no weight in leading indices. Hence, investors should not panic and sell every profit-making stock, irrespective of the industry they belong to. On Monday evening, the leading indices in the US were hammered again with the Nasdaq composite index down over 3% in mid-session, while Dow Jones index was down 2% and S&P 500 2.6%.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-dives-1-5k-pts-on-selling-by-foreign-funds/articleshow/89102553.cms,1

IT stocks, along with Reliance Industries, contributed the most to the day’s slide while buying in banking stocks cushioned the fall to some extent, BSE data showed.89166420Along with stocks, bonds and rupee too were hit as a result of the US Fed statement. India government bonds too witnessed a sell-off with benchmark yield almost hitting the 6.75% level, a two-year peak, while the rupee weakened below the 75-to-the-dollar mark as fears about foreign fund withdrawal from the stock market grew.Data from BSE showed that on Thursday, foreign funds were net sellers at Rs 6,267 crore. Since talk about a US Fed withdrawal of its bond buying programme has been going on for a while, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been taking money out of India, market players say. As a result, so far in the month, net selling by foreign funds from the stock market is almost Rs 29,000 crore (nearly $3.9 billion), combined data from BSE and CDSL showed. This is the highest monthly net withdrawal by FPIs from equities since March 2020, when at the start of the Covid pandemic, the sensex had tanked over 40% in less than three weeks.According to S Ranganathan, head of research, LKP Securities, even as the US Fed left key interest rates near zero, its hawkish commentary quickly washed away gains in global markets, leading to a gap-down opening in indices back home. “As FPI continued to book profits from Indian (stocks), value stocks made a comeback with the PSU Bank Index rallying over 5% (Thursday afternoon), supported by auto stocks, to stage a smart recovery,” Ranganathan wrote in a post-market note.The day’s slide also left investors poorer by about Rs 2.8 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 263.2 lakh crore, official data showed.In the government bond market, the yield on the 10-year benchmark hit almost 6.75%. In this backdrop, bond dealers said that the government’s planned Rs 24,000-crore bond auction on Friday will be interesting to watch out for. On the one hand, bond buyers would prefer to buy bonds at a lower price (that would push up yields), while RBI may be more inclined to keep yields under check.In the forex market, the rupee slid 29 paise to close below the 75-per-dollar mark again, at 75.07.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-tanks-581-points-as-federal-reserve-signals-rate-hike/articleshow/89166416.cms,1

India’s dependence on Chinese imports extends across the entire energy sector and the nation has taken a raft of measures to curb imports from its neighbour as relations have soured over fears of cyber-attacks, border conflicts and pandemic-related supply disruptions. Power minister Raj Kumar Singh last week raised new concerns when discussing plans for local manufacturing of smart meters. The nation doesn’t want to “buy anything from our northern neighbour,” he said. Adding production in clean energy technologies “opens up huge employment opportunities and will take the country on a sustainable development path,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said Tuesday while presenting the nation’s budget. The new policy will help boost India’s self-sufficiency in solar modules and open up export opportunities, according to credit assessor Crisil Ltd. Incentives will potentially help create 30 to 35 gigawatts of solar module capacity and as much as 30 gigawatts of cell capacity by 2024, Crisil said in a tweet.Along with more aid for solar module makers, India will encourage the use of biomass pellets as fuel in thermal power plants, Sitharaman said. To promote the blending of ethanol with gasoline, the government will levy an additional excise duty of 2 rupees a liter on unblended fuel starting in October.The government will also sell green bonds to finance low-carbon infrastructure built by state-run companies, the minister said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-to-spend-2-6-billion-on-solar-to-curb-reliance-on-china/articleshow/89272506.cms,0

On Monday, K Madhavan, the reticent, media-shy president at Walt Disney India, gave an interview saying his company would stay ""bullish on all sports rights renewals,"" and the timing of his statement was further seen as an effort on part of the company to frantically convey they are very much part of the competition.The Zee-Sony merger is being seen as a catalyst to these developments, but individuals in that very camp are watching in rapt attention what's coming next.Amazon, the e-retail giant that also happens to be among the leading OTT players and has been actually 'bullish' in the sports rights market lately, must be watching closely too.The whispers are thick and loud. Is there a new player that hasn't shown its hand yet? Could be Comcast, could be Temasek, could be Blackstone -- speculations are on.There's quite a bit of talk already that Shankar and Murdoch's JV - Lupa Systems - could come in with less than 10% stake in this new set-up; Viacom18 could go on to hold another 10 to 11% while a new player stepping in could come with the remaining 30 to 31%. Reliance's own step-down subsidiary TV18 continues to hold the remaining 51%.Here in India though, those in the fray already are seeking answers to this Big Question first: Why are Murdoch and Shankar planning to return to the very space in which they were undisputed market leaders already, decided to sell out, and cash in three years ago?James is media mogul Rupert Murdoch's younger son. The Murdochs had sold 21st Century Fox to the Walt Disney Company in 2019 in a deal valued at US$71.3b.Shankar, meanwhile, was the architect of Fox's India business, Star, and the man who founded Hotstar. Fox's India business alone went on to become 18% of the overall deal at which Murdochs sold the company to Disney. A good chunk of that 18% was cricket alone - with IPL at the helm.""When names like these make a splash again, the industry is bound to sit and take note,"" says a media veteran, tracking developments.Constantly in denial that he would return to the very space he quit one-and-half years ago, the news of Shankar's return, especially at a time when cricket rights in India and globally estimated to be worth around US$7b are set to go on sale, can only suggest one thing: The 'actual players' looking to build a war-chest for the next media rights cycle want someone to guide them from right at the top than they building the business from scratch - what Shankar had done with Star India 10 years ago.""Then who better than Shankar? Ten years ago, the industry landscape was changing at a time where new players were needed. He led Star India from scratch and made things happen. But this time, we're already seeing market consolidations at play. So, if a new company or JV has to step in, it has to step in right at the top and there's not much time left either. So, what they need more than most is someone to guide them,"" say sources watching developments.American telecom conglomerate Comcast, based out of Philadelphia and with massive interests in content production, has been looking to enter Indian markets for a while now. In July 2019, the company had made an offer to buy out Zee promoters but backed off with the understanding that they would not retain control.Even if they enter in the present scenario with Murdoch and Shankar, Comcast will once again not have any control. Then why is the name being speculated? ""Because it's now or never. They have been looking to enter the Indian markets for a while now. This is one last big opportunity for them. And probably the realization that they'll not be able to enter this space with overall control, so why not begin somewhere?"" say those tracking these developments.Temasek Singapore, a state holding company of the government, that manages portfolios worth US$400b, is also looking for an entry. ""We're getting more comfortable with deployment of capital in India,"" the Temasek-India head was quoted as saying last year.New York-based alternative investment management company Blackstone, that has been one of the largest investors in leveraged buyouts, is the easiest among speculations given the US$600b-plus assets managed by the company.One of these is being seen as the 'hidden hand' in the move behind Murdoch and Shankar and there's fierce prediction it could be Comcast, not Temasek. But there's little to confirm any of this until things are said on record.An investor like Blackstone will one again allow Shankar to be the elephant in the room, that he once was before Star went to Disney.Those who've watched Shankar closely the last few years can't deny he left Disney with a lot on his mind. ""He moved on as president, Disney APAC, only when the company appointed Rebecca Campbell for the top-job at Burbank. But who knows? Maybe his interests in this space never waned,"" say those who've seen him from closer quarters.In snatching the very (cricket) rights from Disney that he brought to them on a platter all those years ago could be Shankar's one final splendid drive along the covers.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-media-rights-between-burbank-and-south-mumbai-uday-shankars-return-has-caused-huge-ripples/articleshow/89263159.cms,2

The policy will initially focus on battery swap services for electric scooters, motorcycles and three-wheeled auto rickshaws, the official said, in a boost for sectors like last-mile delivery and ride-sharing.  India said on Tuesday it will introduce a new policy to promote swapping, a service that allows EV drivers to replace depleted battery blocks for freshly charged ones at swap stations. This is faster than charging the vehicle and reduces range anxiety for drivers. A battery is also the most expensive part in an EV and swapping allows companies to offer it as a service through lease or subscription models, bringing down the cost of owning and operating the vehicle, industry executives say. The government is likely to offer EV owners an incentive of up to 20% of the total subscription or lease cost of the battery and this will be in addition to what they already get for buying clean vehicles, the person said. In 2019, India set aside 100 billion rupees ($1.3 billion) to promote EVs by giving incentives directly to buyers, but only about 10% of this has been used. Incentives for battery swapping will likely be given from the same fund, the official said. Globally, battery swapping has been slow to gain traction especially among carmakers. Tesla Inc, years ago, tested the model and decided not to offer it to customers but rival Nio Inc offers swap services across China. Last month, Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology announced plans to launch swap stations. In India, oil giant Reliance Industries has formed a joint venture with Britain's BP Plc to offer battery swapping. Motorbike maker Hero MotoCorp and Taiwan's Gogoro have also partnered to set up swap stations, and the service is offered by start-up Sun Mobility as well.  The government will also define battery design and charging standards for companies that want to set up swap stations. This is to ensure the batteries can be used across EV models of different automakers, the official said.  ""The idea is that if one company sets up a battery swap station, vehicles of another company should be able to use the same battery and service. Disruption will only come with scale,"" the person said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/cars/india-close-to-finalising-incentives-under-new-battery-swap-scheme-source/articleshow/89330568.cms,2

Adding 'V' of $1, the minimum price comes to $14 per mmBtu.The sale price will be higher of the bid price or the government-approved rate for domestic gas, NIO said.The government dictated price for gas produced by state-owned firms such as ONGC presently is $2.90 per mmBtu.The rate Reliance is seeking is higher than the price at which the company had sold the same gas last year.Gas will be delivered at Shahdol in Madhya Pradesh, which is connected to the nationwide gas pipeline network through the HVJ pipeline, the NIO said.Last year, Reliance had sold three-fourths of the gas from the same CBM block to an affiliate of the company. India Gas Solutions Private Limited, a 50:50 joint venture of Reliance and UK's bp, bought 0.62 mmscmd out of 0.82 mmscmd gas bid out in that auction.State-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd cornered 0.17 mmscmd while 0.03 mmscmd was picked by Reliance Gas Pipeline - the entity that transports gas from the CBM blocks in Madhya Pradesh to consumers.The price bid was 9.2 per cent of the prevailing rate of Brent crude oil price, which translated into a rate of $8.5 per mmBtu at current oil prices.In the last year's auction, Reliance had sought bids for 0.82 mmscmd. Bids were initially sought at 9.5 per cent of Brent rate as the base or minimum price and asked bidders to ""enter bids that are higher than or equal to it."" It later lowered the base price to 8.7 per cent of Brent.At the current $92.5 per barrel Brent crude oil price, the price of gas produced from coal seams, called CBM, comes to $8.5 per mmBtu.Reliance started commercial gas production from the CBM blocks in March 2017 and reached a peak of 3 mmscmd before the end of 2018.CBM is natural gas stored or absorbed in coal seams and contains 90-95 per cent methane.The pricing formula used last year and this year is a variation over the 2017 formula when Reliance had sought bids in the form of a deductible from 12.67 per cent of prevailing Brent crude oil price plus $0.52 per mmBtu plus $0.26 per mmBtu.In that bidding for up to 3 mmscmd of gas, Reliance had outbid rivals including GAIL to buy the entire volume.Last year, Reliance and its partner BP plc of UK bid out 7.5 mmscmd of gas from its eastern offshore KG-D6 block by pricing the fuel at JKM (Japan Korea Marker).The JKM represents the price for spot LNG delivered in the Asian market and is now being widely used in the LNG industry as a marker for medium/long-term LNG contracts instead of traditional linkage to oil.

They can also buy green power from exchanges. In both cases, inter-state transmission will be free when the power is used for producing green hydrogen. The government will also allow the green hydrogen/ammonia manufacturers to bank unconsumed renewable power, for up to 30 days, with distribution companies and take it back when required.The transmission charge waiver will be available for projects commissioned by June 30, 2025 and the link to the grid will be provided on priority.Since the announcement of a hydrogen mission in the 2021 Budget, several companies such as including Reliance Industries Ltd, the Adani Group, ACME Group, state-run IndianOil and GAIL have announced green hydrogen plans.“Government has tried to address some of the key demands of the industry in terms of open access, grid banking and faster approvals for green hydrogen and ammonia projects. The provisions to set up bunkers near ports for the export of green ammonia is especially welcome,” ACME group chairman Manoj K Upadhyay said.He said it will be important to build upon the first phase with mandatory green hydrogen and ammonia purchase obligations for creating the initial demand. “At the same time, an equivalent of PLI scheme for green ammonia is desirable to make India competitive globally.”ACME has set up its first green hydrogen plant in Rajasthan and investing upto $5 billion in a large place in Oman.Industries such as oil refineries and steel plants consume hydrogen, which they produce from natural gas or naphtha. While hydrogen per se is carbon-free, the use of fossil fuels results in carbon emissions.Green hydrogen is produced by electrolysing water using green power. When green hydrogen is used, it emits oxygen, which can be filled in cylinders for supplying to hospitals or other industries. Green ammonia is produced by using green hydrogen.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hydrogen-policy-offers-25-year-transmission-fee-waiver-for-green-power/articleshow/89652093.cms,2

There is an existential crisis to our earth due to climate change, which is the biggest threat to our planet’s well-being. The prosperity that has occurred due to fossil fuels has been at the cost of the planet.

He also spoke of the touted “fourth” industrial revolution needing to be an “earth-friendly” one.“Recently, the hydrogen policy was announced by the Centre, at a time when governments around the world are still grappling with hydrogen as a fuel.

But bargain hunting later in the session helped the index recover some ground. With strong buying emerging in Reliance Industries and Tata Steel in late trades, the sensex finally closed with a 778-point loss at 55,469, while on the NSE the Nifty closed 188 points down at 16,606.Investors are jittery due to the worsening situation in the Russia-Ukraine war and rising oil prices when the rupee is also showing weakness. On the domestic front, the government’s indications that the much-awaited IPO for LIC may be delayed weighed on sentiment too, market players said. Wednesday’s selling in the stock market was led by foreign funds, as has been the case for the last few months. During the day, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers at Rs 4,339 crore, while domestic institutional investors, or DIIs were net buyers at Rs 3,062 crore, BSE data showed.According to Emkay Global Financial Services head (sales) S Hariharan, FPI flows have decisively turned negative in the current year with net outflow at around $9 billion. Historically, DIIs have absorbed selling by FPIs with a similar quantum of deployment. But it has also been observed that weak price action, as a result of foreign fund selling, is followed by outflows from DIIs as well. “As a result, the flow picture looks quite adverse despite the recent 10% correction in the Nifty,” Hariharan wrote in a note to clients.The current selloff has also led to higher volatility with the India VIX, which measures this, now hovering at 30 — up around 50% from about a month ago. According to Religare Broking VP (research) Ajit Mishra, markets have been gradually inching lower amid erratic intraday swings, but the dent is more severe on the broader front. “We feel the volatility is here to stay and the scheduled weekly expiry would further add to choppiness on Thursday.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-dives-778-pts-as-crude-surges-fpis-sell/articleshow/89956453.cms,1

Amazon's position has been backed by a Singapore arbitrator and courts in India.Reuters reported this week that Reliance had started to take over around 500 of Future's stores, rebranding them as its own outlets.Reliance had previously transferred leases of some of Future's flagship supermarkets to its name, but allowed Future to continue to operate them.Reliance has now begun to take possession of them after Future failed to make rental payments to it, sources have said.Amazon plans to initiate criminal proceedings against Future in a New Delhi court, and to urge the court to order an investigation into the matter, one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of the plans, said.Two other sources said the lawsuit could be filed as early as this week.Future, Amazon and Reliance did not immediately respond to Reuters' emails seeking comment.Amazon will allege that Future concealed information during legal proceedings and allegedly transferred leases of its stores to rival Reliance, even though a Singapore arbitrator had halted any transfer or disposal of assets in the ongoing dispute, the first source added.""This is going to be Amazon's last attempt (to stop the deal),"" said this source.The plan to start criminal court proceedings would mark a significant escalation in the legal battle between Amazon and its Indian retail rivals - Future Retail and Reliance, which is led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani.The protracted fight over Future's assets is seen as a battle for retail supremacy between Reliance and Amazon in India's booming retail market.In blocking the Future-Reliance transaction, Amazon has long argued that Future violated the terms of a 2019 deal in which the US company invested $200 million in part of the Indian company.Debt-laden Future has previously said Amazon is incorrectly interfering in its retail business.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/amazon-plans-to-file-criminal-case-against-future-over-store-transfers-report/articleshow/89955201.cms,1

In intraday trades, the index had dipped below the 55k mark for a brief while. While ICICI Bank, Asian Paints and Reliance Industries accounted the most for Thursday’s slide, strong buying in Infosys, ITC and HCL Tech cushioned the fall to some extent, BSE data showed.

The midcap index on the BSE closed 0.6% lower, while the smallcap index closed in the green, up 0.4%.Thursday’s session witnessed foreign funds take out another Rs 6,645 crore from the stock market, taking the year’s net figure to nearly Rs 84,000 crore, data from both CDSL and BSE showed.

It is currently switching to clean energy by investing across the value chain of solar, batteries and hydrogen.

Exporters and financials led the rally as a weak rupee would add to their bottom line, while Reliance Industries continued to face selling pressure since the rising crude oil price is seen as a drag on the prices of its products.The day’s gains came despite heavy foreign fund selling with the session’s net outflow from the stock market at Rs 8,143 crore — that’s more than $1 billion, one of the biggest single-session net outflow figures in recent months. The day’s outflow number also took the calendar year’s total figure to over Rs 1 lakh crore, BSE and CDSL data showed.After the early slide in the sensex, the recovery came on the back of buying in software exporters. In the broader market, stocks of pharma companies that show substantial export revenues, also rallied.According to Geojit Financial Services head (research) Vinod Nair, domestic indices reversed the trend and traded with gains led by export-oriented sectors like pharma and IT, which witnessed buying interest as the rupee fell to record lows. Favourable exit poll results of state elections and buying in mid- and small-caps at lower levels also helped in restoring some optimism among domestic investors, he wrote in a post-market note.

Not only has he jolted the US giant in the ,"NEW DELHI: Amazon has been added to the list of companies that have been outmaneuvered by Mukesh Ambani’s juggernaut. Not only has he jolted the US giant in the fight to dominate India’s retail sector, he now holds all the cards in a $3.4 billion dogfight to buy a local cash-strapped retailer.In late February, Reliance Industries quietly began poaching employees and taking over rental leases of hundreds of stores once run by Future Retail and Future Lifestyle Fashions, even as Amazon furiously tried to block formal acquisitions through lawsuits and arbitration across India and Singapore. Ambani’s bloodless coup forced Amazon to seek settlement on the bitter dispute and alarmed Future’s investors and lenders wary of asset-stripping.“We did not expect Reliance Group to take such drastic actions, without even discussing the matter with us,” Future Retail’s chief financial officer (CFO) Chandra Prakash Toshniwal wrote in a March 2 letter to Reliance’s retail units. “Please confirm that there will not be any reduction in consideration payable.”Another letter, dated March 5 -- Bloomberg has copies of both the letters -- sent by Future Lifestyle expressed “concerns and shock” and requested Reliance not to undertake such actions that “may be viewed seriously by the Lenders, who have charge on all current and fixed assets” of the company. Banks may cut off Future’s credit lines, crippling what’s left of an already cash-starved retailer, the letter said.The Kishore Biyani-led Future Group got caught in the tussle between two large corporations after Amazon objected to Reliance’s August 2020 offer to buy Future Retail’s stores and warehouses for Rs 24710 crore ($3.4 billion). The American e-commerce giant said the deal violated its 2019 agreement with another Future Group firm as it bled out Future Retail, which has missed debt obligations and faces bankruptcy risk.Future Retail said in an exchange filing late Wednesday it has received termination notices on sub-leases for 342 large and and 493 small stores from the Reliance group. These stores contributed as much as 65% of revenues but are currently not operational for stock and inventory reconciliation. Separately, Future Lifestyle has received termination notices for 112 sub-leased properties from Reliance entities that were bringing in a similar proportion of revenues.Future Group ran India's biggest retail grocery chain before the pandemic struck, making it a juicy target for two of the world’s richest men -- Ambani and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos -- as they jostle for control of the only billion-plus consumer market where foreign firms can compete.Representatives for Reliance, Amazon and the Future Group didn’t immediately respond to emailed queries seeking comments on the letters. The fate of Future Group investors, including Blackstone and L Catterton, and lenders now hang in balance as Reliance, Future and Amazon hammer out an out-of-court settlement by March 15, when they need to report progress to Supreme Court. Reliance’s tactical win offers it the “master key,” giving it the strongest position at the negotiation table, according to Nirmal Gangwal, Mumbai-based founder of financial advisory firm Brescon & Allied Partners LLP.Amazon is the latest player to witness how the Reliance conglomerate muscles in and eventually dominates nearly every sector it gets into -- petrochemicals, crude oil refining, consumer retail, telecom, digital services and, more recently, green energy.Tacit takeoverLast week, Amazon sought to bury a nearly two-year-old legal spat, five days after local media reported Reliance’s tacit takeover of stores by signing new lease agreements with landlords owning Future’s stores and sending job offers to 30,000 workers from the Future Group. Amazon’s disbelief at the turn of events came through during court hearing last week. The American e-tailer’s lawyer Gopal Subramanium said Future Group told them the deal with Reliance will take six months or more to close. “It has hardly been 48 hours and people are taking over shops,” he said.But the drawn-out litigation hurt Future Group the most. The two Future firms owe 300 billion rupees in total debt, on the back of dwindling cash flows and operations.Reliance will honor the definitive agreement they signed in the past, a person close to the development said, who did not want to be identified as the matter is private. It has also extended the period for closing the transaction by six months to September 30. Treading carefullyAnother person familiar with the developments said Future Group was treading carefully as it doesn’t want to unsettle Reliance right now.That tone of measured caution, bordering on desperation, comes through in the letters sent by Future firms.“We have always acted with full transparency and have considered Reliance Group as a partner,” Future Retail said in the letter, adding that it was hopeful of closing the transaction soon. “We would, therefore, request that you do not take any actions against us.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-mukesh-ambani-outfoxed-amazon-in-a-3-4-billion-deal-dispute/articleshow/90125112.cms,1

These were then sub-let to the Future Group for operation.""The company has received certain termination notice(s) in respect of sub-leased properties from Reliance entities,"" Future Retail said in a stock exchange filing.""So far notices have been received in respect of 342 large format stores (such as Big Bazaar, Fashion@ Big Bazaar (fbb)) and 493 small-format stores (such as Easyday and Heritage stores) of the company,"" it said.Separately, Future Lifestyle Fashions said it has received termination notices for 34 'Central' stores and 78 'Brand Factory' stores.""These stores have been historically contributing approx. 55 per cent to 65 per cent of retail revenue operations of the company. As of now, these stores are not operational for stock and inventory reconciliation,"" it said.Reliance Retail, the retail arm of the oil-to-telecom conglomerate, had in August 2020 agreed to take over the retail and logistics business of the Future Group for Rs 24,713 crore but the deal couldn't be closed, as Future's warring partner Amazon went to courts citing violation of some contracts. Future denies any wrongdoing.Future Group entities said they are ""in continuous discussion with the Reliance Group for maintaining status quo and safeguarding the interest of various stakeholders.""Future, which owns more than 1,700 outlets, including the popular Big Bazaar stores, had not paid lease rents for some of its outlets. This is because the firm is neck-deep in losses and even defaulted on loan repayments.Facing closure, Reliance transferred the leases of some stores to its step-down subsidiary, RRVL and sublet them to Future to operate the stores, the sources said.In addition, a majority of inventory at these stores was being supplied by Reliance Jiomart as a cash-strapped FRL could not clear dues to existing suppliers. Reliance will likely replace Big Bazaar signages and branding from these stores with its own brand.These sub-leases are being terminated.It isn't clear why Reliance took this decision.Reliance has since then started rebranding the stores and offered to take all employees employed there on its payroll, they added.Amazon has argued that Future violated the terms of a 2019 deal the companies signed when the US e-commerce giant invested $200 million in a Future Group unit. Amazon's position has been backed by a Singapore arbitrator.Future had in January challenged its lenders in the Supreme Court to avoid facing insolvency proceedings over missing bank payments, citing its dispute with Amazon.In August 2020, the loss-making retail giant proposed to sell its retail, wholesale and logistics arms that included businesses including Fashion at Big Bazaar, Koryo, Foodhall and Easyday to Reliance for Rs 24,713 crore.

Thursday’s 817-point surge was the biggest gain for the sensex following any state election results.The rally had started on Tuesday after exit polls the previous evening indicated strong gains for the BJP and the upswing gathered momentum on Wednesday. In last three sessions, the sensex has added a little over 2,600 points, or nearly 5%, since closing at a seven-month low of 52,843 on Monday, mainly because of uncertainties relating to the Ukraine war.At close of Thursday’s session, the sensex was up 817 points, or 1.5%, at 55,464. The Nifty on the NSE was up 250 points, also 1.5%, at 16,595. The rupee too gained by 26 paise to end at 76.31 to the dollar.According to Aishvarya Dadheech, fund manager at Ambit Asset Management, the strong performance by the BJP in the state elections provided a much-needed support to the market. “State elections’ outcome took away the political instability risk in India for at least two years,” Dadheech wrote in a note.In Thursday’s session, Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and Hindustan Unilever accounted for most of the day’s gains. On the other hand, technology stocks witnessed some selling pressure, BSE data showed. The day’s gains, however, came despite foreign fund selling. End-of-the-session data on the BSE showed that foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers at Rs 1,981 crore. Domestic funds, on the other hand, were net buyers at Rs 946 crore.Brokers believe the state poll results are unlikely to impact the market’s direction in a major way. Investors’ focus will now shift towards “how policymakers minimise the economic cost of the geopolitical quagmire”, a report by Emkay Global noted. According to Dadheech, investors still need to be vigilant because the uncertainty of the geopolitical standoff looms large. “Commodity prices are least likely to see a secular downturn even after war subsides because sanctions will continue to disrupt the global supply chain. Unless sanctions are withdrawn, the global markets can remain volatile.”Friday’s market is also expected to be impacted by the US market that showed a weak trend early in Thursday’s session, mainly because retail inflation for February in the world’s largest economy was 7.9% — the highest reading in over 40 years.

This is because private-sector lenders HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, which were planning to hold a big chunk of IDRCL’s capital, are classified as foreign entities under the law and need to get permission from the government for the investment.The bad bank proposal, announced in the February 2021 Budget, envisaged a public sector National Asset Reconstruction Co (NARCL) that will acquire bad loans from banks. Once these loans were aggregated from multiple lenders, they would be resolved with private sector expertise from the IDRCL.In January 2021, SBI chairman Dinesh Khara had announced that the NARCL had received all approvals to start operations and that loans worth Rs 50,000 crore would be transferred to the NARCL by March 2022. However, the second leg of the resolution would require the IDRCL to be in place.While the RBI has granted permission to the private banks to invest in IDRCL, foreign investment norms require them to get a government nod as well. All three private banks are predominantly owned by foreign investors.Meanwhile, PSU banks have ensured that IDRCL is incorporated by making the initial investment. Earlier this month IDBI Bank, which is now a private bank, said it will invest Rs 272 crore by way of equity and debt in IDRCL. It said that by end of March, its stake would be 9%.Last week, UCO Bank said that it was acquiring a 3% stake in IDRCL for Rs 1.5 crore. The bank had indicated that it will complete the transaction this month. In February, Bank of Baroda said that it has subscribed to 99,000 shares amounting to a 12.3% stake in the company, which would come down to 9.9% by end of March 2022.For banks, it is a race against time for the transfer of loans to the bad bank. Since most of the loans are provided for, any recovery would go towards profits. The fact that the security receipts are guaranteed by the government would help release capital for the banks. In the earlier quarters, there have been large recoveries almost every quarter, which has added to the bottom line of lenders. The fourth quarter has not seen any major recovery. Banks are hopeful of recovering Rs 3,600 crore on their loans to Sintex Industries following Reliance Industries being declared the highest bidder. However, the consummation of the deal might slip into the next financial year. The rise in bond yields following the war in Ukraine would mean that treasury earnings will not be there in the fourth quarter and banks may instead have to make provisions if yields remain high.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/foreign-pvt-banks-need-govt-nod-to-back-debt-recast-firm/articleshow/90189808.cms,1

Last September, the firm had announced it will invest in sustainable technologies including batteries, electrolyzers for hydrogen production, and fuel cells to create a multi-billion-dollar clean energy portfolio.The company subsequently formed a series of partnerships and acquisitions in fields including hydrogen and photovoltaic cells.In January, it paid $135 million to purchase Faradion, a UK start-up developing sodium-ion batteries.Lithium Werks is a leading provider of cobalt free and high-performance lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries.With the recent resurgence in demand for LFP batteries, Lithium Werks is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the global opportunities before it through its integrated portfolio of LFP solutions, the statement said.""The combination of Lithium Werks with Reliance's recently announced acquisition of Faradion Limited, a global leader in sodium-ion cell chemistry, further strengthens Reliance's technology portfolio and provides it access to one of the world's leading portfolio of LFP patents and a management team,"" it said.The company plans to leverage the experience of senior management teams, together with the technology and know-how gained through acquisition of Faradion and Lithium Werks.This will allow Reliance to establish an end-to-end battery ecosystem for manufacturing at large scale key supply chain materials such as cathode, anode, electrolyte, giving it the flexibility to produce batteries and battery module systems consisting of different chemistries for various applications across energy storage and mobility.Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries said: ""LFP is fast gaining as one of the leading cell chemistries due to its cobalt and nickel free batteries, low cost and longer life compared to NMC and other chemistries. Lithium Werks is one of the leading LFP cell manufacturing companies globally and has a vast patent portfolio and a management team which brings tremendous experience of innovation across LFP value chain.""""Along with Faradion, Lithium Werks will enable us to accelerate our vision of establishing India at the core of developments in global battery chemistries and help us provide a secure, safe and high-performance supply chain to the large and growing Indian EV and energy storage markets,"" he said.Joe Fisher, co-founder and CEO of Lithium Werks said: ""This deal means increased resources and expanded global reach, while leveraging our experienced team and IP portfolio and providing scale and momentum to help drive our product innovation, capacity expansion and accelerate our clean energy strategy.""The transaction is subject to certain regulatory and other customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed by June 2022.

Amazon has been contesting the planned $3.4 billion sale of Future Group's retail assets to Reliance, first announced in 2020, and the case is currently before the Supreme Court.  Reliance, the country's biggest conglomerate and retailer, began taking over the prized real estate with utmost stealth on Feb.25 when its staff showed up at many of Future biggest stores to assume control, sources have told Reuters. In ads headlined ""PUBLIC NOTICE"" in leading newspapers on Tuesday, Amazon said: ""these actions have been done in a clandestine manner by playing a fraud on the constitutional courts in India."" Future and Reliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Amazon's public outcry comes even though on March 3 it offered to hold talks. The ongoing talks have raised hopes the dispute could be resolved. Future has said in filings this month that it could not pay rent at many outlets given its distressed financial situation and that Reliance, which had taken over many of its leases, had issued it with termination notices. Amazon is concerned that Reliance is continuing to take over Future stores even as the talks continue, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

Reliance's investment in Lithium Werks, which manufactures lithium iron phosphate batteries that are mainly used in electric vehicles (EVs), includes funding for future growth, the company said late on Monday. The assets, acquired through its subsidiary Reliance New Energy, include Lithium Werks' portfolio of about 219 patents, a manufacturing facility in China, key business contracts and existing employees, it said. The deal comes as Reliance looks to cut dependence on its mainstay oil-to-chemicals business, with plans to invest $10 billion in clean energy projects to boost its green credentials and meet its goal of net zero carbon by 2035. Reliance agreed in December to buy Faradion, a UK-based sodium-ion battery company, for an enterprise value of 100 million pounds ($130 million). The two companies will give Reliance access to technology that will be key in its plan to manufacture batteries and battery systems in India. ""Along with Faradion, Lithium Werks will enable us to accelerate our vision of establishing India at the core of developments in global battery chemistries,"" Reliance's owner, billionaire Mukesh Ambani said in the statement. It will allow Reliance to provide ""a high-performance supply chain"" to the growing Indian EV and energy storage markets, he added. India is offering incentives of up to $6 billion to companies to build EVs and batteries locally as the government looks to establish a domestic supply chain for clean transport and renewable energy.

That battle has successfully blocked a $3.4 billion sale of its retail assets to India's largest retailer Reliance, citing violation of certain contracts.Future denies any wrongdoing. But Reliance Industries suddenly took control of hundreds of Future stores late last month, citing non-payment of rent, after assuming many of the leases held by cash-strapped Future.State-owned lender Bank of Baroda will be the first to take Future to the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) and is expected to file the paperwork this week, the two bankers said.""We are taking this step as a measure of last resort because we want to protect ourselves in this legal fiasco,"" said one of the bankers directly involved in the matter. ""Going to DRT will ensure that Reliance can't pull another sudden move.""Other lenders are likely to follow suit, the second banker with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.Future Retail and BoB did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Future Group as a whole has more than $4 billion in debt and lenders have already started classifying the loans as non-performing assets (NPA) this quarter.Lenders are also likely to subsequently file a case in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that handles corporate insolvency cases, both bankers told Reuters. Future and Amazon are fighting it out at multiple levels, including at Supreme Court.Given the legal complexities in this case, approaching the DRT first is likely to help banks attach, seize and sell Future's assets promptly, instead of going after the entire company at NCLT, Ketan Mukhija, a partner at Link Legal said.""It is a very strategic, tactical call (by the banks),"" he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-to-start-debt-recovery-proceedings-against-future-retail-report/articleshow/90361817.cms,1

According to officials, the land on which the Global City project is set to come up is a part of an area that had been transferred to Reliance Industries in 2006 to be developed as a special economic zone (SEZ). After Reliance backed out of the project in 2014, it subsequently returned to the government.In 2016, the government announced that the Global City will be jointly developed by a Japanese firm and the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (DMICDC). It, too, failed to take off due to differences between DMICDC and HSIIDC, which owns the land.In 2019, the government finally designated the land as a ‘special zone’ allowing mixed land use to develop residential, commercial and recreational facilities alongside.Before the conference, Khattar is also set to inaugurate the newly constructed underpass, flyover and foot overbridges (FoB) near Huda City Centre metro station. The project has been completed at the cost of Rs 52.52 crore by the GMDA to decongest the area around the metro station. Under this project, a 750-metre-long four-lane underpass and a flyover near the metro station and two FOBs at Signature Tower and IFFCO Chowk have been constructed.The CM will also inaugurate an 8,429-metre-long water supply line for Sectors 111to 115, installed at the cost of Rs 10.1 crore.The department of town and country planning had issued licences to 33 real estate projects in this area, of these occupation certificates have been issued to 12 projects. At present, around 93,000 people live in this area and they are dependent on water tankers for their daily needs of water. The pipeline will supply around 3 MGD (million gallons per day) to the area.“The quality of water is so good that residents do not need to use RO provided society has clean water storage facilities,” a GMDA official said.Khattar is also scheduled to also participate in the ‘Pariksha pe Charcha’ programme with the students at a government school in Sector 43.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/khattar-to-hold-round-table-meet-on-global-city-project/articleshow/90579027.cms,2

The increase will also be reflected in the escalation in other costs related to transportation and insurance.Domestically produced gas is supplied on a priority basis to certain sectors, with power producers consuming 30 per cent, the fertiliser sector around 27 per cent and city-gas distributors 19 per cent in FY21.""The gas price increase will hit the fertiliser sector's profitability by increasing working-capital requirements, which is also facing higher import costs due to rising crude oil prices.""Auto gas fuel prices may be increased but should remain competitive against liquid fuels, albeit with a reduced differential as liquid auto fuel prices also rise with increasing crude oil prices. The cost of power generated by gas-based power plants will increase, further affecting their utilisation,"" Fitch added.

Described as a “super-app” and in the pipeline since at least mid-2020, the website called it “a unified platform that connects several brands across the Tata universe like never before.” The 154-year-old Tata group, which makes luxury cars, trucks, air conditioners, smart watches, tea besides operating luxury hotels, airlines, utilities, departmental stores and the local Starbucks Corp. franchise, wants to leverage the diversity of its products and services to lure buyers in a country of almost 1.4 billion people, who are increasingly shopping online. India’s e-retail segment is expected to be worth as much as $140 billion by March 2026, Bain & Co. estimates, and is the only large consumer market still open to foreign companies, making it a prize fight for global and local retail firms.The all-in-one app will have a loyalty program for retaining customers.

The carbon savings on these are to offset emissions from oil and chemical businesses.In an April 10 note, Goldman Sachs said Reliance is adopting a manufacturing approach to net zero emissions with a hyper integrated model spanning solar, battery and hydrogen and a focus on a net-zero supply chain.""RIL's energy business is best in class, in our view, with the highest complexity globally and the lowest cost structure driving stable and higher margin capture versus peers,"" it said.This helps the firm to earn higher refining margins over the industry benchmark.""Alongside refining, we also expect (oil and gas) exploration and production (E&P) to drive the next leg of growth for the energy segment, as we estimate E&P EBITDA of $2-2.6 billion in FY23/24 versus $35 million in FY21 driven by rising domestic gas production and more than doubling of domestic gas prices,"" it said.While for petchem, margins are expected to trough in the current quarter and a recovery ahead led by economic run cuts from higher-cost North Asia crackers and likely underperformance of ethane prices to oil prices.""We believe RIL's investment in new energy can be fully funded by internal cash generation from their old energy business (oil-to-chemical) and in turn, could drive one of the fastest net-zero target (2035) amongst large energy value chain companies,"" Goldman said.It forecast EBITDA and free-cash-flow generation of $35 billion and $4 billion respectively over FY22 to FY24 from RIL's old energy business as compared to $10 billion capex announced for New Energy.On its new energy strategy, the brokerage said RIL is planning to manufacture polysilicon, wafers, cells, modules, EV and grid storage batteries, elelctrolyzer, and fuel cells.""We see RIL as India's largest greenabler with the company's total projected outlay of $10 billion over the next three years. RIL has already spent $1.5 billion to acquire technologies across the solar battery and hydrogen ecosystems,"" it said.It saw significant expansion in the market for solar, battery and hydrogen manufacturing globally as well as in India and expected RIL to generate EBITDA of $3.6-12.2 billion by FY30 & FY40.""We value RIL's new energy segment at $30/48 billion in our base and bull case respectively,"" it said. ""The hyper integrated model can position RIL as one of the lowest cost green hydrogen producers with RIL targeting costs at around $1 per kg by end of this decade.""For consumer-facing businesses of Reliance, Goldman Sachs forecast a compounded annual growth rate of 29 per cent in EBITDA for telecom between FY22-25 and a 43 per cent rise in retail EBITDA.""While RIL is already the market leader in the telecom business, we expect market share wins to compound rising penetration for organized retail and e-commerce business.""We believe RIL's existing dominance in telecom and offline retail, combined with its partnership and the online traffic dominance of Facebook, can create the fastest-growing internet platform in India,"" it said.Within e-commerce, it forecast RIL's online GMV will reach $35 billion in FY25 with a 31 per cent market share.

Reliance has bought an average 5 million barrels a month for the June quarter, the sources said. Reliance did not immediately respond to a Reuters' email seeking comment. Before the Ukraine war, Indian refiners, including Reliance, rarely bought Russian oil owing to high freight costs. But Western sanctions against Russia since its Ukraine invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"", have prompted many oil importers to shun trade with Moscow, depressing its crude prices to record discount levels . Indian refiners have snapped up the cheap barrels as India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, is hit hard by high oil prices. India imports about 85% of its 5 million barrels per day oil needs. While New Delhi has called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, it has not explicitly condemned Moscow's actions. India has also abstained from voting on multiple United Nations resolutions on the invasion. Refinitiv's tanker flow data shows a supply of about 8 million barrels of Russian oil, mainly Urals, at the Reliance-operated Sikka port in western India, for arrival between April 5 and May 9. Most of these barrels are supplied by Russian trader Litasco, the Refinitiv data shows. Traders said Reliance is buying Russian oil on delivered basis. Reliance is scheduled to received its first parcel of Russia's ESPO oil in early May, the Refinitiv data shows. This grade is mostly supplied to China. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance operates two refineries at the Jamnagar complex in western India that can process about 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil daily.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-buys-at-least-15-million-barrels-of-russian-oil-report/articleshow/91002456.cms,1

With this, in two sessions, the sensex has gained over 1,400 points, BSE data showed. Thursday’s surge came after the stock price of Reliance Industries, the most valued company in India and an index heavyweight, rallied to a life-high level on the back of an extremely bullish Morgan Stanley report. On Wednesday, global financial major Morgan Stanley released a report on RIL with a price target of Rs 3,253 — a 23% upside from that day’s close. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said that hydrogen is set to play a major role in the upcoming energy transition for the global economy and the Indian energy major’s proposed heavy investments are expected to pay rich dividends. The analysts equated its foray into the green hydrogen space with a repeat of how the stock was rated when RIL entered telecom and the retail sectors. 90991895Boosted by strong analyst recommendations, RIL rallied nearly 2.5% in intraday trades and closed at Rs 2,782. As a result, its market capitalisation also jumped to Rs 18.8 lakh crore, taking it close to the $250-billion mark. The stock added nearly 200 points to the sensex’s Thursday gain of 874 points. Other top contributors to the sensex’s gain were Infosys, HDFC and HDFC Bank.Despite a rally, market players are still cautious because of continuing foreign fund selling.

The unequal treatment led to the removes move last week, when the local banks rebuffed billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate’s offer, derailing what would’ve been the largest acquisition in the Indian retail sector. Reliance Industries announced the purchase plan in August 2020 but struggled to complete the transaction in the face of legal challenges mounted by Amazon, which argued it had the first right of refusal contractually.Bank of India and State Bank of India, the main bankers to Future Retail, didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment on reasons for voting down the deal. Representatives for Future Group and Reliance also didn’t immediately comment. State-run lenders risked probes from federal agencies if they accepted these discriminatory terms, they said, explaining their preference now for a court-mediated insolvency process where bids are called in and there’s no risk of them being accused of cutting a bad deal. Bank of India has already requested an Indian court to initiate the process. Hard-nosed decisionThe hard-nosed decision by banks has pushed the teetering Future Retail, which ran one of the nation’s largest retail grocery chains before the pandemic struck, one step closer to bankruptcy.It has also taken the wind out of a tortuous two-year-old litigation between Reliance and Jeff Bezos-owned Amazon -- the e-tailer had started arbitration proceedings in Singapore to block the deal -- but left the door open for Ambani to snag these retail assets, possibly at an even cheaper price, under the bankruptcy process. “Reliance and other parties could be eligible to bid for its assets by submitting their resolution plans” even if Future Retail ends up in bankruptcy, according to Satwinder Singh, New Delhi-based partner at law firm Vaish Associates Advocates. “This would also lead to moratorium on any or all ongoing arbitration proceedings against Future.”While the local lenders were agreeable to the deal when it was first announced, a lot changed in the past year or so, the people said. While the Amazon lawsuit dragged on, the asset value eroded and the pandemic worsened the cash crunch at Future Retail that began defaulting on its debt repayments.Bloodless coupReliance dealt a body blow to the Kishore Biyani-led Future Group in February when it quietly began poaching employees and taking over rental leases of hundreds of stores earlier run by Future Retail and Future Lifestyle Fashions Ltd. Ambani’s bloodless coup prompted Amazon to suggest settlement talks on the bitter dispute and alarmed Future’s investors and lenders who worried about asset-stripping.The out-of-court truce talks between Amazon, Future and Reliance collapsed soon after they were initiated, the companies informed India’s top court on March 15. “A major turning point was when Reliance physically took over Future’s stores, which turned it into a no-holds barred situation,” said Devangshu Dutta, head of New Delhi-based retail consultancy Third Eyesight. “Before this the battle was being fought in courts and across the negotiating table. But at this point it moved over to the real business.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-a-creditor-revolt-scuttled-mukesh-ambanis-3-2-billion-retail-deal/articleshow/91081611.cms,1

IRENA's Francesco La Camera told the Reuters Global Markets Forum late on Monday that India was ""very serious"" about meeting the challenges and was very interested in developing offshore wind power. La Camera said India was also ""on track"" to reach its 2030 commitment to produce 50% of its energy from non-fossil fuels. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has raised India's nationally determined contribution (NDC) target of non-fossil energy capacity to 500 giga watts (GW) by 2030, from just over 151 GW currently. India's onshore wind capacity stands at over 40 GW, and for grid-connected or centralised solar power plants capacity is at around 60 GW. India is already exploring pilot projects in offshore wind power, but was unlikely to enter that space until after 2030 as the technology is still expensive, said Vaibhav Chaturvedi, a fellow at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) think tank. La Camera said the government expects green hydrogen - made from water and clean electricity - to power sectors, like steel, that find it hard to abate CO2 emissions. He also emphasized the need to set up ""standards and certification"" as India begins exporting green hydrogen with conglomerates Reliance Industries, Adani Enterprises , along with state-run energy firms NTPC Ltd. and Indian Oil Corp. setting out manufacturing plans. India plans to manufacture five million tonnes of green hydrogen per year by 2030 to meet its climate targets and become a global production and export hub for the fuel.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far resisted Western encouragement to scale back its relationship with Moscow because of the opportunity to get heavily discounted oil. India is also highly dependent on imports of Russian weapons. India’s state-run refiners can take about 15 million barrels a month -- about a tenth of overall imports -- if Russia agrees to the price demands and delivers the oil to India, the people said. Government-affiliated processors will stand to benefit from any potential agreement, they said. Private refiners such as Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy typically procure their feedstock individually. The Indian government didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.Moscow is looking at ways to keep supplies flowing to India -- both from the west via the Baltic Sea and on routes from the Russian Far East that become more accessible during the summer, the people said.The two countries have even been exploring re-routing some crude through Vladivostok in the Far East.

Apart from the policy tightening, hawkish commentary on inflation dragged the key indices lower.”Brokers are still cautious with all eyes on the US Fed meeting outcome amid the 50bps rate hike decision.

The benchmark index swung wildly from a low of 53,918 to a high of 54,795 - a difference of 877 points - during the day.The fall came even as foreign funds continued to take money off the Indian stock market.

With foreign investors continuing to sell in the Indian market, brokers and dealers said Tuesday’s surge was more of a relief rally after days of fall, supported by some positive global cues including news about easing of the Covid-induced lockdown in China. Shortcovering in the later part of the session also helped lift the index above the 54k mark, they said.A sharp rally in sensex heavyweight Reliance Industries, along with strong buying in ICICI Bank, Infosys and ITC, contributed the most to the sensex’s gains. All the 30 index constituents closed with gains — a rare event. Tuesday’s surge added about Rs 12. 2 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 258. 8 lakh crore. Part of this gain, about Rs 5. 3 lakh crore, came because of the listing of LIC on Tuesday.However, foreign funds continued their selling spree, taking out a net Rs 2,192 crore from the stock market. This took the month’s total outflow to over Rs 30,000 crore, CDSL and BSE data showed.According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, the sharp uptick in the market was propelled by short-covering seen in several large caps and especially in sectors like metals, which were deeply oversold. However, there are concerns over inflation and interest rate hikes, which could cap the index’s upside, he wrote in a postmarket note.“In the near term, investors will closely monitor the US Federal Reserve chair’s speech, scheduled later on Tuesday. Also, investors will keep an eye on eurozone GDP data for the first quarter, due later Tuesday.

Flagship entity Adani Enterprises has set up a100% subsidiary, Adani Health Ventures, to run medical and diagnostic laboratories, research centres and other healthcare related activities in the country.The move pits Adani Group, India’s third-largest conglomerate in terms of market cap, against the Tata Group and Reliance Industries that have made significant investments in the healthcare space.In 2020, Tata Group, India’s largest conglomerate in terms of mcap, had set up Tata Medical & Diagnostics. It had launched Covid test kits, introduced Tata Health (offers consultation service through a network of physicians) and had acquired online pharmacy 1MG. In the same year, Reliance Industries had acquired pharma distributor and online drug retailer Netmeds. To be sure, all the three conglomerates have a presence in healthcare through their foundations that run hospitals. In a regulatory filing, Adani Enterprises, which incubates new businesses for the group, said the May 17 incorporated healthcare entity will commence its business operations in due course. It has already taken baby steps in this area by acquiring a minority stake in an Israeli startup, Forsight Robotics, for $20 million, in April this year. Forsight is a platform designed for eyesurgeries.Adani observers expect the Ahmedabad-based conglomerate to acquire diagnostic laboratories and pharmacy retail chains — a strategy it has followed to enter new areas — to propel its healthcare play.

Mukesh Ambani, the second richest in India and ninth in the world, has seen his fortune swell by $8 billion in the same three-odd months, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.The billionaires are profiting from a surge in global commodity prices, which are tied to the revenues of their largest group companies. The prices of crude oil, coal and edible oil started rising in the second half of 2021 as global demand picked up. Then they shot through the roof when Russia invaded Ukraine. And so did the fortunes of Adani and Ambani.Shares of the group flagships Adani Enterprises (AEL) and Reliance Industries have risen 40% and 12% between February 24, when the invasion began, and May 18, after cooling from their April highs as a global stock rout wiped out some of the gains in early May. <iframe title=""Adani and Ambani's flagships have done better than the market since Russia's invasion"" aria-label=""Interactive line chart"" id=""datawrapper-chart-83bCC"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/83bCC/3/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""400""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>The two tycoons are stepping in at a time when many developed countries are scrambling for alternative sources of fuels as they try to back away from Russian supplies. This month, the Group of Seven most-industrialised nations pledged to ban imports of Russian oil, which is Ambani’s commodity of choice. The disruption has brought the focus back on the need for more coal, which is Adani’s main commodity of trade. medium91683186How Adani became as rich as Ambani medium91683200Adani and Ambani’s net worths stack up in different waysAdani owns 75% stakes in Adani Enterprises (AEL), Adani Power and Adani Transmissions.

His stake in Adani Wilmar, the 50:50 joint venture with Singapore’s Wilmar Group, is held indirectly through AEL, and isn’t counted directly in his portfolio by Bloomberg.About 70% of his $107-billion wealth is accounted for by three of the seven listed companies in his group. <iframe title=""Companies that account for 70% of Adani's wealth are outperforming the market"" aria-label=""Interactive line chart"" id=""datawrapper-chart-Z7KXQ"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/Z7KXQ/1/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""400""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>In contrast, almost all of Ambani's $92.4-billion net worth derives from his 45% stake in Reliance, the most valuable company in India. Like for Adani, the shares are held by a promoter group that includes holding companies, trusts and family members. They are all credited in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index analysis, except the stake held by his mother.Ambani’s 27-storey Mumbai mansion, Antilia, is valued at more than $400 million, according to a September 2014 analysis by property surveyors that Bloomberg has counted in. He had also collected more than $3 billion in dividends as of November 2021. medium91684722Adani and Ambani profit in different waysThe economics of their businesses work differently, too. The ability of the two billionaires to increase profits depends on whether the retail prices of their commodities grow faster than their import prices.Ambani is the largest private importer of crude oil in India, and its Jamnagar refinery – the largest in the world – is designated for exports. Adani is the largest coal and edible oil importer in India but he mostly faces the Indian market.Let’s look at Adani first. His flagship AEL has invested more than $3 billion in coal mines in India, Australia and Indonesia. Their Carmichael mine in Australia started shipping coal this year.In a May 4 earnings call, AEL director Vinay Prakash said the company plans to raise the annual capacity of the Australian mine to 15 million tonnes through 2022-23, about 50% more than what its board approved for the first phase of the project, Bloomberg reported.New production and high prices have allowed AEL to clock a 30% jump in profit for the three months ended March – its highest in six quarters.The company’s future looks promising too. Global coal demand is expected to rise to a record level in 2022 and stay there through 2024, the International Energy Agency has said.But it’s a different set of calculations for Adani Wilmar, in which AEL holds 44%. The company’s revenues rose 46% in 2021-22, its first results since listing on February 8.Four-fifths of that revenue comes from edible oils. Overall, Adani Wilmar has a fifth of the Indian edible oil market cornered under its Fortune brand.Though analysis shows that edible oil companies haven’t yet fully passed on the global price rise to its customers, the segment contributed ₹1,289 crore to Adani Wilmar’s profits, while its overall profit before tax stood at ₹1,059 crore. The deficit of ₹230 crore came from the food and FMCG segment that continued to report losses, and higher financing costs. <iframe title=""Adani Wilmar: Global prices of edible oil rising, but not all of it passed on to Indian customers"" aria-label=""Interactive line chart"" id=""datawrapper-chart-et2zb"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/et2zb/2/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""400""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>On the other hand, almost 60% of Reliance's revenues comes from oil refining and petrochemicals. And surging retail prices have aided the company to post one of its biggest quarterly profits ever.Unlike Adani, Ambani is benefitting on the cost side too. Thanks to India’s refusal to vote against Russia at the UN and join the economic sanctions, the world’s third largest oil producer is offering its Urals crude at a hefty $30 a barrel discount to India.As a result, Russia became the fourth-largest oil supplier to India in April, up from the 10th position in March, with volumes set to rise further in coming months, tanker tracking data analysed by Reuters showed.Reliance’s Jamnagar facility, which has been upgraded to process Urals, is refining 20-30% of the Russian crude, an oil market analyst told TOI Plus on the condition of anonymity. It even deferred a scheduled maintenance of the facility to help churn out more diesel and petrol, whose margins have shot up to touch a three-year high. So it’s a win-win of lower costs and higher retail prices.  <iframe title=""Reliance's increasing margin: crude oil prices rising slower than retail prices of its output"" aria-label=""Interactive line chart"" id=""datawrapper-chart-VAYrM"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/VAYrM/2/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""400""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();</script>Refiners in India exported 3.37 million tonnes of diesel in March, the highest since April 2020. And petrol exports reached a five-year high of 1.6 million tonnes, according to data from the government’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.Reliance's joint CFO V Srikanth told reporters on May 6: “We have minimised feedstock cost by sourcing arbitrage barrels,” industry-speak for oil that others wouldn’t buy because of the sanctions. Like AEL’s view of coal, Srikanth said, “The overall demand drivers are very promising.”It isn't just these two Indian billionaires benefiting from the commodities surge. Others include US oil and gas tycoons Harold Hamm, Richard Kinder and Michael Smith, and Indonesia's Low Tuck Kwong, the boss of coal mining company PT Bayan Resources, who have all seen their wealth increase this year.Though Adani, 59, and Ambani, 65, have unveiled a combined $142 billion in green investments over the next few decades to pivot away from coal and oil – the bedrock of their empires – they are also finding it hard to kick the fossil-fuel habit as the conflict stokes demand.With inputs from Bloomberg, Reuters and other agencies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-ukraine-war-made-adani-ambani-richer/articleshow/91683006.cms,0

The day’s sharp slide left investors poorer by Rs 6. 7 lakh crore, the second sharpest single-day loss in 2022, with BSE’s m-cap at above Rs 253 lakh crore.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-plunges-1400-points-as-wall-street-gets-rate-hike-jitters/articleshow/91675624.cms,1

The offloading in the US, mainly on the back of fears of aggressive rate hikes by the US Fed to tame inflation — along with weakness in other global markets — impacted sentiment in the domestic bourses, brokers and dealers said.Thursday’s selloff in the Indian market was led by Infosys, Reliance Industries, TCS, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, BSE data showed. ITC, on the other hand, rallied over 3% to cushion the slide partially.According to Axis Securities chief investment officer Naveen Kulkarni, growth momentum in the global economy is slowing down due to liquidity tightening by central banks. “The Russia–Ukraine conflict is also not showing any signs of easing with newer categories of weapons being introduced in the conflict, which will keep energy and food prices high. Both these variables point to a stagflation kind of scenario globally, which can lead to discretionary spending going down. This is fuelling greater volatility in global equity markets, including in India.” Stagflation describes a period when there is rising inflation even as employment rate and demand fall in an economy. Kulkarni expects markets to remain volatile in the near term but sees better conditions in the second half of the financial year once investors price in the impact of the global slowdown and higher rates.Like in the past few sessions, Thursday’s selling on D-Street was also led by foreign funds. BSE data showed that foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers at Rs 4,900 crore. On the other hand, domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 3,226 crore. The day’s FPI outflow from the stock market took the current month’s tally to over Rs 36,000 crore, which is more than February’s figure of Rs 35,592 crore but less than March’s Rs 41,123 crore, CDSL and BSE data showed. Thursday’s slide left investors poorer by Rs 6.7 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 252.4 lakh crore, official data showed. The day’s market cap drop was the second biggest in 2022, behind a Rs 8.9-lakh-crore loss on January 24. Thursday’s selling also left investors in LIC poorer by over 4% during the day after the stock, which dived to its life-low level of Rs 839 on the BSE, ended at Rs 841. That is 11.4% lower than the Rs 949 at which the shares were offered in its recently closed IPO.Across the globe on Thursday, Nikkei in Japan had closed 1.9% lower while the FTSE in the UK was down 2.5% in late trades and the US market opened deep in the red.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/markets/sensex/fpi-selloff-sinks-sensex-investors-lose-rs-6-7l-cr/articleshow/91673103.cms,1

This is because of deep discounts of $35 per barrel, particularly on the sought-after Urals crude.The Journal said refineries are processing this crude and exporting petrol, diesel and chemicals such as alkylate, which is used to boost octane levels in petrol, to the US and Europe as they shun Russian products. It said traders and shippers are opting for high-sea transfers to obfuscate the origins of crude brought from Russia.The report mentions a ship chartered by Reliance Industries Ltd, India’s largest private refiner that runs the world’s largest refinery complex at Jamnagar, Gujarat, sailing from nearby Sikka port with a cargo of alkylate without mentioning a destination. It updated its destination to a US port three days later and delivered the cargo in New York.A Reliance spokesperson wasn’t immediately available. Other industry executives described the report as “hit job” on successful Indian refining industry and pointed out there’s no sanction on Russian oil and gas. On ship-to-ship transfers, the executives said it is driven by arbitrage and a common practice where cargoes are diverted to the benefit of traders. “Savings of even a few cents per barrel results in huge savings, given the volumes,” an executive of a refining firm said requesting anonymity. Another executive pointed out that state-run refineries too have bought discounted spot cargoes of Russian oil from traders through tenders since the conflict. RIL has been importing Russian oil for last three-four years as has been the Rosneft-owned Nayara, India’s second private refinery. RIL set up an alkylate unit at its export refinery over a decade back to be able to make petrol suitable for exporting to markets like California that have much higher fuel standards. It has been exporting the chemical for a decade.On the ship incident mentioned by the Journal, the executives said the vessels are chartered and once they set sail with the cargo, the companies have very little say except to see that the delivery is made on time. Many times, the ships head for high seas and get their destination a few days later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-refiners-debunk-wsj-report-on-russian-oil/articleshow/91948540.cms,2

While it has added four stocks to its MSCI India index, namely Tata Elxsi, Adani Power, Jindal Steel & Power and AU Small Finance Bank, HDFC Asset Management Company was booted out from the index. Another Gautam Adani-owned group stock Adani Green’s weighting in the MSCI India Index was cut as it admitted new stocks.Adani Green Energy, the group’s biggest firm by market value, led the rout, plunging a record 12% in trading volume on Wednesday, June 1, about nine times the average of the past three months. Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and Adani Power fell by at least 5% each. 91940526 MSCI published additions and deletions to its global indexes last month but the announcement didn’t detail changes to the weightings of individual stocks in its indexes. The changes took effect at close of trading on Tuesday and analysts said Adani Green’s weighting in the MSCI India Index was cut as it admitted new stocks.What is the MSCI index? The index includes a collection of stocks of all the developed markets in the world, as defined by MSCI. The index includes securities from 23 countries but excludes stocks from emerging and frontier economies making it less worldwide than the name suggests. A related index, the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI), incorporated both developed and emerging countries. MSCI also produces a Frontier Markets index, including another 31 markets.What is the MSCI India Index The MSCI ( Morgan Stanley Capital International) India Index is designed to measure the performance of the large and mid cap segments of the Indian market. With 106 constituents, the index covers approximately 85% of the Indian equity universe. There are four consitutents:LargestSmallestAverageMedianThe top ten constituents of the index as of April 29, 2022 are 91937209 91937231 Many reputed Indian companies across sectors are included in the index. The index includes 10 major sectors of the economy such as IT, finance and energy sectors. Index methodoology: The index is based on the MSCI Global Investable Indexes (GIMI) Methodology—a comprehensive and consistent approach to index construction that allows for meaningful global views and cross regional comparisons across all market capitalization size, sector and style segments and combinations. This methodology aims to provide exhaustive coverage of the relevant investment opportunity set with a strong emphasis on index liquidity, investability and replicability. The index is reviewed quarterly—in February, May, August and November—with the objective of reflecting change in the underlying equity markets in a timely manner, while limiting undue index turnover. During the May and November semi-annual index reviews, the index is rebalanced and the large and mid capitalization cutoff points are recalculated.The MSCI India is a weighted index just like the Sensex. This means every stock on the index has a particular weightage, which depends on a number of parameters. The three most important are: the returns (dividend) that investors receive on the shares; the company's total turnover, and its market capitalization, according to Kotak Securities.Turnover and market capitalization represent how big or small a company is. Bigger the market capitalization of the company, higher the weightage allotted to it. This means, the index comprises of some of the biggest companies in India. The index is reviewed four times in a year. New companies are listed after a review, while some are delisted for not meeting the parameters set by the index.Why FIIs use MSCI India index:Foreign investors want to know more about the stability and volatility in the prices of shares. ""The amount of funds that a foreigner will invest in an Indian share will be directly dependent on the stock's weightage on the MSCI index. If the weightage of a company is reduced then there is always a possibility of foreign investors withdrawing their funds.Often many investors prefer to follow a benchmark index for their stock investments. So, suppose they have to invest Rs 1 crore, they will divide this amount and invest in different stocks that form an index. How much portion will be invested in a single stock depends on its weightage. If a stock has 10% weightage in the index, then they will invest 10% of the Rs 1 crore-Rs 10 lakh, in the stock. Similarly, they invest in all the stocks that form the index depending on the weightage. This is called passive investing. Every time the index components are re-formed or the weightages are changed, foreign investors too re-adjust the portion of their investment in the individual shares,"" noted Kotak Securities in a note.What is the May 2022 rejig all about? MSCI has included Adani Power, AU Small Finance Bank, Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL), and Tata Elxsi in the MSCI India Index, whereas HDFC Asset Management (AMC) has been dropped. These changes in the MSCI India Standard Index came into effect from June 1. However, index funds are expected to rejig portfolio on May 31 itself. The semi-annual index review has also included 50 small-cap firms to the MSCI India Domestic SmallCap Index and dropped 10 stocks.The additions include Apollo Tricoat Tubes, Aptus Value HSG Finance, Bharat Dynamics, CE Info Systems, Easy Trip Planners, Equitas Small Finance, ESAB India, GHCL, Go Fashions India, Godawari Power and Ispat, Greaves Cotton, Greenpanel Industries, among others. Adani Power Ltd, Bajaj Consumer Care, Cholamandalam Investment, Future Retail, GMR Power & Urban Infra, IOL Chemicals and Pharma, Jindal Steel & Power, NCL India, Solara Active Pharma, Spandana Sphoorty Fin, have been removed from the smallcap India index.To be eligible for inclusion in a MSCI index, a leading provider of research-based indexes and analytics, a security’s Foreign Inclusion Factor (FIF) must reach a certain threshold. The FIF of a security is defined as the proportion of shares outstanding that is available for purchase in the public equity markets by international investors.According to a note by Edelweiss, Tata Elxsi is likely to see flows of $188 million, followed by $150 million each in Adani Power and Jindal Steel & Power. Among the stocks, whose weightage has increased, Reliance Industries tops the list, followed by Sun Pharma, Godrej Consumers, United Spirits, ICICI Lombard and Page Industries.""On expected lines, Reliance Industries share count will increase due to partly paid conversion to ordinary shares seen in November 2021 and the consequent weight up will lead to approximately inflow of $335 million,"" Edelweiss said.Sun Pharma could see inflows worth $90 million, Page Industries could see inflows of $55 million, Godrej Consumer could see inflows of $35 million, United Spirits could gain by $25 million worth of flows and ICICI Lombard ($20 million) due to a rise in their weightages in the MSCI index.Meanwhile, Bharti Airtel may see $225 million in outflows following a cut in index weightage. Adani Green Energy, NTPC, Vedanta, Maruti Suzuki and Hindalco Industries are expected to see $100-220 million outflows.Following the change in Adani Green’s weight in the MSCI India Index, the stock could see outflows of about $220 million, Abhilash Pagaria, an analyst with Edelweiss Alternative & Quantitative Research, wrote in the note. NTPC could see outflows worth $155 million, while Maruti Suzuki and Vedanta could each lose $125 in outflows due to a cut in the index weightage. Others that could see otflows due to a cut in weightage include JSW Steel ( $85 million), Info Edge ( $25 million) Tech Mahindra ($70 million), HDFC ( $55 million), Tata Consumer ( $40 million) Ambuja Cements ( $40 million) and Pidilite Industries ($20 million).(With inputs from Bloomberg)",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/markets/sensex/what-is-the-msci-india-index-and-why-it-matters/articleshow/91937093.cms,2

Emails to the Adani group and MSCI went unanswered outside business hours. 91812240The moves underscore how shares of Adani’s companies are vulnerable to outsized swings, compounded by lower liquidity relative to those of stocks such as Reliance Industries Ltd, which backs the fortune of multi-billionaire peer Mukesh Ambani. “Adani Green soured sentiment for the group’s stocks as its weighting reduction in MSCI India Index took effect,” Brian Freitas, an analyst for independent research platform Smartkarma, said by phone. “Adani Power saw profit taking as it had run up ahead of its inclusion in the same index.” 91937093A share rally in the companies of the ports-to-power conglomerate had taken Adani ahead of Ambani as Asia’s richest person earlier this year.

Apart from Hamleys, RBL owns home-grown toy brand Rowan.The deal comes against the backdrop of global retailers such as Ikea looking to increase the sourcing of toys, albeit wooden ones, from India. A joint statement by both RBL and Plastic Legno said the investment will not only help RBL bring vertical integration for its toy business but allow it to diversify its supply chain with a long-term strategic interest in building toy manufacturing in India.“It is imperative for RBL to build design-to-shelf capability for an advantage over the competition and to be an accelerator in building a robust toy manufacturing ecosystem in India not only for domestic consumption but also for global markets,” said an RBL spokesperson.Dream Plast, which operates three factories in India, is a plastic injection moulding company speciali- sing in the production of toys, food packaging containers, sports items and childcare products.

But insurance companies are valued by their EVs, which takes into account the worth of the assets they hold.The report pointed out that, over time, LIC’s market share in individual business (retail) has fallen due to lack of a “diversified product portfolio and excessive focus on single-premium and group business”.

Their proposal values Boots at more than £5 billion ($6.3 billion), one of the people said. The move could put Apollo and Reliance in pole position to buy Boots, after rival suitors started having second thoughts. Their main competitor, a consortium of Britain’s billionaire Issa brothers and TDR Capital, has been considering dropping out of the race due to disagreements over price, Bloomberg News reported in late May. Walgreens has been seeking a valuation of about £7 billion for Boots, people with knowledge of the matter have said. The business runs a network of more than 2,200 stores across the UK, as well as private-label brands like No7 Beauty Co and operations in a smattering of other countries. Reliance, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, may be looking to tap its expertise in emerging markets to wring further growth out of the British high street staple.Ambani, who is one of India’s richest men, is in the midst of pivoting his traditionally refining-focused conglomerate toward businesses that will better help him tap the country’s billion-plus consumers. A winning bidder could be picked as soon as the coming weeks, the people said. Walgreens plans to keep a stake in the business after any deal, according to the people. Deliberations are ongoing, and there’s no certainty they will lead to a transaction. Representatives for the consortium and Walgreens declined to comment.The Boots sale has emerged as a litmus test for dealmaking in the UK as credit markets become increasingly fragile.

""But if oil is not being available (at petrol pumps) and they are being exported... exported with such phenomenal profits. We need at least some of it for our own citizens and that is why we have taken this twin-pronged approach.""""It is not to discourage exports, it is not to discourage India as a refining hub. It is certainly not against profit earning, but extraordinary times do require some such steps,"" Sitharaman said.The windfall tax on oil producers was triggered by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) reporting bumper profits in the March quarter (when international prices soared to a near 14-year high of $139 per barrel) and record earnings in 2021-22.ONGC reported a record net profit of Rs 40,306 crore on a revenue of Rs 1,10,345 crore in the 2021-22 fiscal. OIL posted Rs 3,887.31 crore net profit in the fiscal. Vedanta's Cairn Oil & Gas, which is India's second-largest oil producer, too had bumper earnings.The new levy plus the oil industry development cess and royalty the producers currently pay will take the total incidence of taxation to about 60 per cent of the oil price.A windfall tax is a one-off tax on companies that have seen their profits surge extraordinarily not because of any clever investment decision they have taken or an increase in efficiency or innovation, but simply because of favourable market conditions.Recently, the UK levied a 25 per cent tax on ""extraordinary"" profits from North Sea oil and gas production to raise $6.3 billion.The export tax follows oil refiners, particularly Reliance Industries and Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy, making a killing in exporting fuel to deficit regions such as Europe and the US in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.They are said to have processed Russian crude oil available at a discount after it was shunned by the West and exported fuel produced from it to Europe and the US.The government also framed new rules requiring oil companies exporting petrol to sell in the domestic market the equivalent of 50 per cent of the amount sold to overseas customers for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. For diesel, this requirement has been put at 30 per cent of the volume exported.These restrictions on export are also aimed at shoring up domestic supplies at petrol pumps, some of which had dried up in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat as private refiners preferred exporting fuel to selling locally.Exports were preferred as retail petrol and diesel prices by dominant PSU retailers have been capped at levels way lower than the cost. This meant that private retailers, who control less than 10 per cent of the market share, either sell fuel at loss or lose market share if they were to sell at a higher cost.Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj said the export tax will be applied uniformly on all exports from any refinery -- be it a domestic unit or an only-for-exports (SEZ) facility. But the export restriction, mandating a certain amount to be sold locally, will not be applicable for SEZ units, he said.Reliance operates two refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat -- one is a domestic tariff area facility while the other is an SEZ refinery. Nayara has a domestic tariff area unit at Vadinar in Gujarat.The finance ministry, in a statement, said crude prices have risen sharply in recent months which has benefited domestic producers who sell oil to domestic refineries at international parity prices.""As a result, the domestic crude producers are making windfall gains. Taking this into account, a cess of Rs 23,250 per tonne has been imposed on crude,"" it said. ""Import of crude would not be subject to this cess.""Small producers, whose annual production of crude in the preceding financial year is less than 2 million barrels, will be exempt from this new cess, the ministry said.""Also, to incentivise an additional production over the preceding year, no cess will be imposed on such quantity of crude that is produced in excess of last year's production by a crude producer.""The ministry said while crude prices have increased sharply in recent months, the rates of diesel and petrol have shown a sharper increase.""The refiners export these products at globally prevailing prices, which are very high. As exports are becoming highly remunerative, it has been seen that certain refiners are drying out their pumps in the domestic market,"" it said without naming any company.In view of this, cesses equal to Rs 6 per litre on petrol and Rs 13 per litre on diesel have been imposed on their exports. These cesses would apply to any export of diesel and petrol from the country.""These measures would not have any adverse impact on domestic retail prices of diesel and petrol. Thus, domestic retail prices would remain unchanged. At the same time these measures will ensure domestic availability of the petroleum products,"" it said.A special additional excise duty (SAED) of Rs 6 per litre has been imposed on exports of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF). Like diesel and petrol, the international prices of ATF have risen sharply and so an additional duty has been imposed.

The tax on firms that have increased product exports to gain from higher overseas margins took effect on July 1, as the government moves to boost domestic supply and revenue. The taxes, and some accompanying export curbs, will hit the earnings of companies such as Reliance Industries, Nayara Energy, which is partly owned by Russia's Rosneft , the Oil and Natural Gas Corp, Oil India Ltd and Vedanta Ltd. ""The taxation would be reviewed every 15 days,"" Bajaj said, adding that it would depend on international crude prices. ""If crude prices fall, then windfall gains will cease and windfall taxes would also be removed."" The government believes such windfall gains will cease once prices fall $40 from existing levels, Bajaj said. Brent crude futures slipped on Monday to about $111.27 a barrel, as fears of a global recession weighed on the market even as supply remains tight amid lower OPEC output, unrest in Libya and sanctions on Russia. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $108.09 a barrel. Bajaj did not provide any estimate of the revenue increase for the government from its windfall tax move.

On Friday, the government slapped an export tax on petrol, diesel and jet fuel (ATF) shipped overseas by firms like Reliance Industries, and imposed a windfall tax on crude oil produced locally by companies such as ONGC and Vedanta.The government also imposed Rs 6 per litre tax on export of petrol and ATF and Rs 13 per litre tax on export of diesel. Further, it levied Rs 23,250 per tonne additional tax on crude oil produced domestically. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the excise duty will also be applicable on special economic zones.""On an annualized basis, we estimate the government to garner around Rs 1.3 lakh crore (Rs 66,000 crore each from petroleum crude production and exports of petrol, diesel, and ATF). The duties will be reviewed on a fortnightly basis. However, if the duties/cess continues for the rest of the year, the government could garner around Rs990 bn (based on FY2022 data on volumes of production and exports). The government does not expect any implication of these measures on prices of fuel products,"" said Upasna Bhardwaj, economist at Kotak.The export tax follows oil refiners, particularly Reliance Industries and Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy, making a killing in exporting fuel to deficit regions such as Europe and the US in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The refiners are said to have processed Russian crude oil available at discount after it was shunned by the West, and exported fuel produced from it to Europe and the US. Refiners were exporting petrol and diesel globally at prevailing prices, which are very high.India imported around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from Russia, up from around 840,000 barrels in May.The restriction on export is also aimed at shoring up domestic supplies at petrol pumps, some of which had dried up in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat as private refiners preferred exporting fuel than selling locally.""The levy of duty/cess on crude production and exports of petrol, diesel, and ATF will help offset the losses from excise duty cuts in petrol and diesel. Assuming that the duty/cess continue for rest of FY2023, we estimate excise duty collection at Rs 3.8 lakh crore compared to our earlier estimate of Rs 2.8 lakh crore. The proceeds will accrue entirely to the center,"" noted Bhardwaj.The government also increased the customs duty on gold imports to 15% from 10.75%.According to Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA, the recent measures taken by the government should help prevent the current account deficit from crossing 3 per cent of GDP. “This will also reduce the depreciation pressure on the rupee,” she added.The rupee weakened further against the dollar on Friday, breaching the Rs 79-mark for the first time.But why the duty change now?In June, several cities witnessed rationing supplies at petrol pumps while some had to shut down due to non-availability of fuel, leading to concerns about shortages and triggering panic buying. By the middle of June, the situation worsened and pumps were directed to stay open all night. The state-run refiners have kept petrol and diesel prices same since April 6 despite the rising trend in international crude prices and have not passed on the increase in global crude oil prices to consumers. The OMCs were incurring huge losses. As the losses mounted, downstream oil companies tried to reduce supply to petrol pump vendors, which resulted in fuel shortage at pumps in multiple states.A few days ago, there were reports from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka that some petrol pumps were running out of stock due to a sudden increase in demand. It came to light that petrol retailers like Jio-BP and Nayara Energy, raised their prices in order to discourage domestic sales and focus on export, following which the government expanded the scope of Universal Service Obligation (USO) which mandates the fuel retailers to ensure that regular petrol and diesel sales are maintained at all petrol pumps, even in the remotest of the areas. Failure to meet norms can lead to the cancellation of licenses.According to an official notification issued on June 30, “The refiners export these products at globally prevailing prices, which are very high. As exports are becoming highly remunerative, it has been seen that certain refiners are drying out their pumps in the domestic market. In view of this, cesses equal to Rs 6 per litre on petrol and Rs 13 per litre on diesel have been imposed on their exports. These cesses would apply to any export of diesel and petrol from the country.”Even finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has raised concerns over “phenomenal profits” made by domestic oil refiners, by curtailing domestic sales.“These are times when oil prices internationally are unbridled. They are just going on and on upwards. And for any country, like India for instance, which depends largely and very heavily on imports, we also need to pay that kind of money to get the imports”, said Sitharaman on Friday.

In Rajasthan, it is almost like a divine intervention. People in the vast desert expanses, lived with a stoic endurance of untold hardship the geography unleashes, never imagined the harsh rays would turn into hopes.As the country steps on the gas to minimize the dominance of energy from coalbased plants, Rajasthan has taken the steering wheel to make solar the energy of the future. Today, the desert state produces the largest quantity of solar power in thecountry, having an installed capacity of over 14,000 megawatt. Given the prospects of new projects and advantages of the whole ecosystem, the number one solar energy producer will remain the leader in times to come.Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd MD Anil Dhaka says, “The new project pipeline is very robust. Projects of 19,000 MW are already in various stages of approval process which will come on stream by 2025. But we are looking to add 30,000 MW. ”The emergence of solar energy as a viable source has been shifting sands in the desert regions of the state that were crying for livelihood opportunities and critical resources for development. What was a bane in about 15 years ago has come as a boon, making the uncultivable land productive, the uneducated employed, while creating contractors, vendors, suppliers and service providers out of ordinary unskilled people.More than that it has attracted hundreds of educated youths in the state and offered them a launchpad for their entrepreneurial journeys. Industry estimates suggest that Rajasthan has added around 650 companies in the sector. TOI talks to a few to understand their experiences.Sunil Bansal | Founder, Diwakar Solar & president of Rajasthan Solar AssociationOne of the earliest solar entrepreneurs, Bansal says that when he entered the business in 2008, it was simply an intuition of a bright future for the sector. After post-graduation he was into traditional businesses.“I have been part of the industry when the tariffs were over Rs 17 per unit of power, just before the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission was launched in 2010. But as the prices of solar panels crashed in subsequent years, everybody realised that it is a matter of time before solar reaches, at least, the rates at which traditional power was sold. In fact, today, it is cheaper than coal-based thermal power,” says Bansal.He says that in coming years, Rajasthan will be the ground zero for generation projects given the availability of cheap desert land, high solar insolation, and the transmission infrastructure.“People running big businesses in big cities are coming to Rajasthan to meet their power needs, thanks to the interstate transmission (IST) infrastructure and policy. Solar energy is called infirm power and it is produced in the day only. But with hydrogen projects, that handicap will be a thing of the past. Hydrogen produced through solar energy can be used at any time and place. Similarly, pump storage is another technology where infirmity will cease to exist. These, in addition to IST projects, have immense possibilities for Rajasthan,” says Bansal.Rajeshwar Singh Rajpurohit | Founder, Ultravibrant Solar Energy Pvt LtdRajpurohit left two government jobs as an electrical engineer and two private jobs, but finally found his true calling in the solar sector. The advancement of technology and the steep fall in panels had already made solar very lucrative when he joined the sector in 2015.Purohit says, “I don’t belong to a business family, but after working a few years in Mahindra Solarize, I realized that it is going to grow big. In the past seven years, I have installed solar rooftop projects worth 35,000 kilowatt. While the margins have been squeezed in recent years due to an influx of new players, I think it’s the best business to be in. I feel proud I am contributing to a sustainable future. ”Ramakant Jangid | Founder, Corona SoltechAfter an engineering degree in 2013, Jangid tried to prepare for government jobs but gave it up thinking of inordinate delays due to paper leakage, reexaminations, etc. After a year in HDFC Bank as junior accountant, he entered the solar pump business in 2017. But as margins got reduced, he set up his engineering, procurement, and commissioning (EPC) venture Corona Soltech.“Last year, my revenues were Rs 9 crore. This year, it is on course to hit Rs 15 crore. If solar has to be a country-wide movement, then rooftop has to play a bigger role. We expect the government to provide us with a stable policy which will help us to plan ahead and keep commitments,” says Jangid.Prateek Agarwal | Founder, Solar91 Cleantech Pvt LtdAfter passing out from IIT Roorkee in 2013, Prateek Agarwal worked for Reliance Industries. But soon he got disenchanted with the world of fossil fuel as he started tracking the rise of solar power, which was getting cheaper by the day then.“I had an entrepreneurial streak and that came to fore when I saw the viability of solar energy,” says Agarwal. He says the if businesses are allowed to buy power from generators without much tax burden and system fees, open access will be a game changer. “It has already been driving the sector, but some irritants need to be removed. Secondly, the state needs to push solar equipment manufacturing which will create an avalaunche of economic activities in the state. ”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/countrys-solar-leader-rajasthan-set-to-add-30000-mw-capacity-in-next-3-years/articleshow/92678990.cms,2

On July 1, the government imposed windfall gain taxes on the export of petrol, diesel and aviation turbine fuel (ATF), and on the domestic production of crude oil. It has also mandated exporters to meet the requirements of the domestic market first. ""The tax increase will reduce the profits of Indian crude producers and oil exporters like Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC),"" Moody's said in its comments on the new taxes. Following the government's announcement, Indian oil companies will have to pay Rs 6 per litre on exports of petrol and ATF, and Rs 13 per litre on exports of diesel. At the same time, upstream producers will have to pay taxes of Rs 23,250 per tonne of crude oil produced in India. ""Based on the production of crude oil and export of petroleum products in India in the fiscal year ended on March 31, 2022 (fiscal 2021), we estimate that the government will generate close to $12 billion of additional revenue for the remainder of fiscal 2022,"" the rating agency said. The additional revenue will help to offset the negative impact of a reduction in excise duties for petrol and diesel announced in late May to tame soaring inflation. In May 2022, the government announced a cut in the excise duty of Rs 8 per litre on petrol and Rs 6 a litre on diesel, which is estimated to have reduced its revenues by Rs 1 lakh crore. ""Significant additional tax revenue will offset fiscal pressure on the sovereign,"" it said. ""We expect this government measure to be temporary and that taxes will be eventually adjusted according to market conditions, including considerations related to inflation, external balances and currency depreciation."" Moody's said higher revenue also supports its view that the gradual fiscal consolidation trend will continue, notwithstanding associated risks posed by the current inflationary environment, such as higher subsidy spending. ""India's higher export duties for fuel products will curtail export receipts, but the concurrent announcement of higher customs duties on gold imports will serve to limit a further widening of the current account deficit. The country's large foreign exchange reserves remain sufficient to preempt any issues concerning the repayment of external debt despite the weakening of the rupee,"" it said. The rating agency said the rise in tax payments is not expected to materially weaken the RIL or ONGC's credit quality because their margins will continue to be healthy. ""High crude oil prices will support the earnings of oil producers. And while profits generated from oil exports will fall because of windfall taxes, they will likely remain higher than the levels over April 2020 to March 2022 if refining margins are sustained at the highs seen in April to June this year,"" it said. The increase in government taxes will limit the earnings upside for RIL's exports, but will not materially affect its solid credit quality and excellent liquidity. RIL is the largest exporter of petroleum products from India. In the fiscal year ended March 2022, the company generated about 41 per cent of consolidated EBITDA from its oil-to-chemicals business. The increase in taxes on crude oil production will reduce ONGC's margins, but this is mitigated by current high oil prices and the company's low cost of production, Moody's said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/12-billion-windfall-for-govt-from-windfall-tax-on-oil-firms/articleshow/92672122.cms,0

While keeping the PIL pending, the HC refused to interfere in the issue at this stage because the petitioner could not place a copy of the order passed on August 17, 2020, by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) authorizing Reliance Industries Ltd and Green Zoological Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre Society to set up a rescue and rehabilitation centre in Jamnagar. The court asked the petitioner to first furnish a copy of the order and said that it would decide the maintainability of the PIL after that. The petitioner has sought directions to CZA and state authorities not to transfer wild animals at the private zoo and stay the August 2020 order granting recognition to the private zoo. The petitioner’s lawyer contended that the law does not have any provision of recognizing a private zoo. The laws were, however, changed in 2020. The petition was based on news reports of 94 wild animals falling in the scheduled category having been brought from Morocco. The petitioner contended that the recognition has been granted under the category of mini zoo under rule 9 of the Zoo Rules, 2009. A mini zoo is allotted less than 10 hectares of land, but the Jamnagar zoo is said to be the world’s largest one to be established. The PIL cited the company’s report and asserted that it is silent on whether the atmosphere in Jamnagar was suitable for animals from Morocco and if the parameters laid down under the rules had been met.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/pil-stop-transfer-of-animals-to-private-zoo/articleshow/92665814.cms,2

The special additional excise duty was slapped on July 1 to discourage overseas sales.The move is in step with recent moderation in benchmark prices.The special additional excise duty (SAED) on diesel and jet fuel exports, slapped on July 1 to discourage overseas sales amid domestic shortages, has been reduced from Rs 6 (7 US cents) per litre to Rs 4 (5 cents). It has been removed for petrol exports.93017541SAED on crude produced from domestic fields, imposed to tap part of the gains from soaring crude prices, has been cut to Rs 17,000 per tonne from Rs 23,250.The duty has also been waived for refined products produced and shipped from SEZs (special economic zones), according to a government notification.The export duty tweak will bring relief to private refiners such as Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy which are major exporters of refined products. Reliance will especially benefit as 52% of the refining capacity at its Jamnagar complex in Gujarat is in an SEZ.The duty reduction will boost the realisation from every barrel of oil produced by companies such as state-run ONGC, Oil India and Vedanta. SAED had eroded their realisation by 40% but was expected to boost government revenue by more than Rs 67,000 crore per year. The reduction will improve realisation for producers but reduce the government's revenue. The duty cuts follow the recent moderation in crude prices and a correction in 'cracks' - the difference between crude and product prices, which has offset the fall in refining margins.Brokerage Citi had on Monday said that the cracks were down by $40-50 per barrel from a month ago, reducing the under-recoveries on petrol and diesel that are being retailed at below cost. The reduced under-recoveries, however, offset the drop in refining margins, Citi said, making a case for export tax review.The SAED was imposed after reports of fuel shortage from several states in June as private refiners starved their dealers to avoid losses as pump prices remained frozen, and preferred to export products at higher margins.This diverted the entire market burden on the outlets of state-run retailers, stretching their distribution infrastructure and forcing them to import products to meet a double-digit growth in demand.The windfall tax was levied on oil producers with more than two million tonne per year. Incremental production above the baseline of last year's production and small players, such as winners of discovered small fields bid rounds, were exempted.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tax-relief-for-domestic-crude-fuel-exports-as-prices-soften/articleshow/93015056.cms,1

Seen sequentially, the net profit was almost four per cent higher than Rs 4,173 crore logged in the March 2022 quarter.It is pertinent to mention here that Jio's ARPU or Average Revenue Per User - a key monitorable metric for all telcos - increased during the March quarter to Rs 167.6 per subscriber per month.Jio's operating profit margin for the just-concluded June quarter stood at 26.2 per cent, slightly higher than the corresponding quarter last year.The net profit margin for the June 2022 quarter came in at 16.9 per cent, which was up 40 bps (basis points) from the same period last year.Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea - the other two private telcos in the market - are yet to announce their Q1 FY23 results.Jio's Q1 scorecard came at a time when the Indian telecom market is poised for the advent of 5G services that will usher in ultra-high speeds (about 10 times faster than 4G) and bring new-age services and business models.The countdown to 5G spectrum auctions has begun, and a total of 72 GHz (gigahertz) of radiowaves worth at least Rs 4.3 lakh crore will be put on the block during the upcoming auction, scheduled to begin on Tuesday, July 26.Besides Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and a unit of billionaire Gautam Adani's flagship Adani Enterprise Ltd are set to participate in the auction of the 5G spectrum.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-jio-reports-24-rise-in-quarterly-profit/articleshow/93054963.cms,0

But the zoo is on 171-hectare land whereas it should be on less than 100-hectare land. This zoo aims to house 1,689 animals of 79 species as against the permission authorising it to keep 100 animals.After hearing for some time, Chief Justice Aravind Kumar told the petitioner’s advocate, “Sir, it (the zoo) is on 289 acres. It will probably be a pride of Gujarat, and you don’t want Gujarat to be developed?”The lawyer replied that he was not challenging the authorisation, but only wishes that rules should be properly followed and his client’s limited interest is in well-being of the animals and to ensure that the rules enumerated under the Zoo Rules, 2009 are not flouted. He further submitted that the private zoo does not have authority to acquire animals and keep endangered animals. This also raises question on efficiency of state-run zoos, he argued. The chief justice countered the argument and asserted that any such initiative for animal rescue may not be termed as wrong.The chief justice further said that if the petitioner may ask for a writ to ensure proper implementation of law in such animal rescue centre, the petitioner’s cause seems genuine. “But to say that ‘don’t open this’, it is tainted. You will have to look into your conduct with a coloured glass. Don’t do that,” the CJ commented.The HC posted further proceeding on Monday.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/jamnagar-zoo-will-be-pride-of-gujarat-says-high-court/articleshow/93041716.cms,1

The petitioner contended that the category for which the private rescue centre has been granted permission is a mini zoo, but the Jamnagar facility has been bringing in scheduled animals from other state-run zoos and foreign countries, which is not permissible. The PIL questioned whether the climate suits animals brought from other countries.After hearing the case, the bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri issued notices to the authorities concerned and sought their replies by August 18, when a further hearing has been posted. While issuing the notice, the chief justice said the court wants to satisfy itself about the condition of and maintenance of scheduled animals. “The short issue and the only apprehension is that they will not take care (of the animals). We will record their statement and close the matter,” the CJ said.The recognition was granted under Rule 9 of the Recognition of Zoo Rules, 2009, for a mini zoo, even when this centre is going to be one of the world’s largest zoos and did not satisfy any of the criteria under Rule 10 which pertains to protection and conservation of wild animals, the petition alleged.

He took himself out of India to this jurisdiction in order to commit those offences – far from this accused being some sort of popular hero or activist in Gujarat, he inspired fear among the people he lived with. It was only when the accused was in the UK that victims came forward to say how they had been treated at the hands of the accused,” she said. She warned the judge ought to be careful about Patel “manipulating the court” and said there was “ample evidence” he was exaggerating his PTSD.She said he had no family or friends in the UK and could not speak English so was isolated in Belmarsh prison and would be better off in a three square metre Gujarat prison cell given the government of India assurances about his treatment and the fact there was less drug and alcohol abuse in Gujarat prisons.To assuage concerns that Patel might receive an irreducible sentence in India, which would violate article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Dobbin pointed to the assurances from the government of India which stated that if convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, Patel would be eligible to apply for premature release after 14 years.She refuted the notion that Patel was a “thorn in the side of Reliance Industries” because he had “ran a campaign against Mr Nathwani” and so would not receive a fair trial in India branding this as “hearsay.” She said he was a “dangerous manipulative person as far as India is concerned”. ""The court need to assess the credibility of the assertions that his prosecution is politically inspired and he was ill treated at the hands of India. Nothing he did is consistent with someone coming here to get humanitarian protection. He has had recourse to false ID documents and bank cards and did not claim for asylum. He lay low for a long time as had false ID.

Of this, Rs 17,511.69 crore worth of claims are verified and the rest of Rs 3,546.20 crore are unverified.  Operational creditors of the Future group firm have filed claims worth Rs 265.16 crore, according to the documents uploaded on the official website of Future Retail Ltd (FRL).  Besides, 462 workmen have also filed claims of Rs 9.83 crore.  As per the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, the IRP collates the claims and a Committee of Creditors is constituted with voting shares of the lenders in the proportion of their loan exposure.  The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal had on July 20 directed to initiate the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) against FRL admitting the plea filed by Bank of India.

The deal was called off by the billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd in April.

Investors and analysts have come to expect major announcements from the conglomerate. Last year, it was the entry into green energy, and the year before, it was the induction of Google as a minority investor. In 2016, it was the launch of telecom services.  Time and Date  The AGM will be held via video conferencing for the third consecutive year on August 29. The meeting will start at 2:00 pm IST, with addresses and presentations expected from chairman Mukesh Ambani and other members of the company’s board and subsidiaries.  Also Read | Reliance to hold its 45th AGM on August 29: All you need to know  The board of directors and shareholders will then vote on 11 resolutions. Six of them are special resolutions, including the appointment of Hital Meswani as a whole-time director, and the insertion of clauses in its articles of association with respect to its new energy business.  Stock Movement  Reliance shares tend to move considerably ahead of and after the AGM. The shares have averaged negligible returns a week prior to the AGM, based on data of the past 10 years. However, they rose almost 4 percent a week after the event, Bloomberg data showed.  Additionally, the shares gained 2.3 percent a month before the AGM and returned more than 6 percent a month after the event, the data showed.  Trading in the stock tends to pick up around the annual event. On average, daily volumes on the counter have spiked 317 percent on the day of the AGM over the past five years. AGM day is easily the most active for the stock.  Big Expectations  As with every Reliance AGM, investors have a set of expectations.  This year, the focus will be on the consumer retail business once again, after chatter that a time line is likely to be announced for the listing of Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail. The induction of private equity investors in both its consumer-facing subsidiaries in 2020 was seen as a stepping stone towards their eventual listing.  Brokerage JP Morgan India said in a recent note that Reliance has enhanced disclosures around related-party transactions, which is seen as a step towards greater transparency ahead of the listing.  “While it is too early to say if the increased disclosures on the large transactions between the subsidiaries are a step on the road to the listing of these businesses, it would be seen as a positive,” JP Morgan said.  Another key expectation will be around the new energy business, which emerged as the biggest takeaway at last year’s AGM. Reliance has since invested in acquiring companies in the segment and expanding capacity.  The company plans to build four gigafactories to manufacture solar panels, electric batteries, green hydrogen and hydrogen fuel cells with an investment of $80 billion. The company sees renewable energy and green hydrogen as tectonic shifts in meeting the world’s energy demands.  In the company’s annual report, Ambani said he expects the green energy business to be the crown jewel of the company in the next seven years, much like he heralded the consumer-facing businesses about seven years ago.  Brokerage JM Financial said investors will await any indication of the induction of strategic investors in the company’s oil-to-chemicals and green energy business as Relance steps up activity in the space.  Attention will also be on Reliance’s plan to roll out 5G mobile phone services after the company mopped up the most spectrum in the recent auction. Reliance invested $11.3 billion to acquire 25 gigahertz of spectrum from the government.  Investors will wait for indications of the pricing of the new 5G services that step-down subsidiary Reliance Jio will offer.  Traders can expect good moves in the stock if the company were to make announcements with respect to these expectations, said dealers.  Beyond AGM  Reliance’s June quarter performance was slightly underwhelming, given the expectations built up due to the surge in global refining margins. The introduction of a special additional excise duty on refining exports also dampened spirits, but analysts remain buoyed over the stock’s prospects.  Of 39 brokerages covering the company, 31 have an outright ‘buy’ rating on the stock while three have a ‘hold’ rating with an average upside of about 12 percent expected in the scrip over the next 12 months.  UBS Securities upgraded the stock recently to a ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’ as it factored in opportunities in the green energy business, which it said could create additional value of $35 billion for the company by 2030.

Ambani made the announcement at the company's 45th Annual General Meeting (AGM). The company has committed 2 trillion rupees ($25 billion) to roll out 5G services in the country. He said that Jio 5G will be the world's largest and most advanced 5G network.Ambani emphasised that Jio 5G will be the True 5G in every sense. The India’s richest man said that unlike other operators, Jio's 5G network will be stand alone with zero dependency on 4G network. He termed the approach being followed by rival operators as ""hasty"". ""Most operators are deploying a version of 5G, called Non-Standalone 5G, which is essentially a 5G radio signal delivered over an existing 4G infrastructure. This Non-Standalone approach is a hasty way to nominally claim a 5G launch, but it won't deliver the breakthrough improvements in performance and capability possible with 5G,"" Ambani said in his speech.Untitled Carousel 93061689Stand-Alone 5G is True 5G""In sharp contrast, Jio will deploy the latest version of 5G, called Stand-Alone 5G, which has zero dependency on our 4G network. With Stand-Alone 5G, Jio can deliver new and powerful services such as low latency connectivity, massive machine-to-machine communication, 5G voice, Edge computing and network slicing, and metaverse. Jio 5G will be True 5G in every sense, and I believe that India deserves nothing less than True 5G."" he added.Ambani said that Reliance Jio has an advantage over its rivals as it is the only telecom to have the right mix of wireless spectrum for 5G. ""At the recent 5G auction conducted by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), we have acquired the largest and the most appropriate mix of wireless spectrum for 5G. This gives Jio 5G a distinct competitive advantage over other operators. In addition to the 3500 MHz mid-band which is globally earmarked for 5G, and the 26 GHz millimetre-wave band for ultra-high capacity, only Jio has the 700MHz low-band spectrum which is essential for deep indoor coverage. And we are able to seamlessly combine these frequencies into a single powerful 'data highway', using an advanced technology, called Carrier Aggregation,"" he said.Untitled Carousel 93148833Reliance Jio is the only company to get the premium 700MHz in all 22 telecom circles or zones during the 5G auction. The 700MHz spectrum can provide 6-10 km of signal range with one tower and forms a good base for offering 5G. Allocation of the 700MHz band is said to be one of the key solutions for meeting the mobile data explosion challenge faced by the telecom industry and regulators, seeking additional spectrum for the deployment of new mobile broadband networks and capacity. Ambani said that all these things give Reliance Jio three major advantages when it comes to rolling out 5G services. ""This three-fold advantage of Stand-Alone 5G architecture, largest and best mix of spectrum, and Carrier Aggregation means that Jio 5G will be able to offer an unparalleled combination of coverage, capacity, quality, and affordability.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/3-reasons-mukesh-ambani-gave-on-why-only-reliance-jio-will-offer-true-5g/articleshow/93856556.cms,0

Reliance Industries Ltd chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani reaffirmed his commitment to new energy during the oil-to-telecom conglomerate's 45th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on August 29.  Ambani said “achieving carbon neutrality globally will require multi decade of investments to the tune of $5 trillion per year, which makes Reliance’s new energy vision far more transformational and far more global”.  The company plans to invest Rs 75,000 crore in new energy.  “We have made rapid progress to create an advanced manufacturing ecosystem for new energy, which will be fully integrated, backed by world-class talent, built on pillars of technological innovation through strategic partnerships, to deliver modular, at scale, affordable and most modern manufacturing business based in India, for India and the world,” Ambani said.  Market experts said that Reliance’s big plans will ensure that the company stays highly valued even as the traditional fossil fuel companies struggle to keep their companies from getting de-rated because of ESG concerns.  Baring this year, as several companies saw stock price head higher because of a surge in oil prices and refining markets, the perception of fossil fuel companies remains poor as the world moves with greater resolve toward new energy to reduce carbon footprint.  “We are aiming for continuous hyper-growth over many decades from new energy and to establish India as a world leader in new energy advanced manufacturing”, the RIL chairman said.

Its strategic acquisitions of Lithium Werks, Faradion and a stake in Ambri have provided the company with differentiated and superior battery chemistries.  The company intends to set up battery-pack facility by 2023, scale it to 5GWh annual cell to pack manufacturing by 2024 and further scale it up to 50GWh by 2027.

It has set the ball rolling to establish Giga scale gH2 manufacturing in India.  The company will also establish 20 GW solar generation capacity by 2025–for round-the-clock and intermittent power for gH2.  Green hydrogen is generated from electrolysis of water, with the entire process run on renewable energy.  Also read: Reliance Industries AGM 2022: RIL to build gigacomplex for power electronics  De-rating of oil companies  The traditional oil manufacturing companies the world over face the risk of getting de-rated in the event of a fall in crude prices, as future growth is likely to shift to new energy.  Even though these companies will continue to generate cash, as oil will continue to find usage the world over for years to come, these companies are likely to see a continued de-rating on future growth concerns.  Until last year, most global oil companies, including giants like Chevron and Exxon Mobile, were trading at low earnings multiples and high dividend yields because of poor investor perception.  But the story may be vastly different for Reliance, despite its dominance in the oil business. Its mega plans of becoming a global leader in new energy businesses, experts feel will not only help the company achieve its target of becoming carbon-neutral but also aid in avoiding a possible de-rating of the stock.  Also read: Mukesh Ambani explains the ‘Founder's Mindset’ for the success of RIL  RIL future-ready  Reliance has credibly proved its capability to diversify into other businesses from its traditional oil &amp;amp; gas business. Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail provide ample proof of it. But the new energy business plans ensure a multi-year growth engine even as the investor perception improves rather than deteriorates.  “With the new energy mega plan, Reliance is again going to do it directly into the new energy ecosystems which are going to replace conventional oil ecosystems,” said Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital.  “The full span from solar energy production to hydrogen technology and battery grid for energy storage makes it likely that Reliance might get entrenched in the new energy ecosystem”.  Gupta is of the opinion that the company’s return ratios could dip in the medium term while the ramp up of new tech is going on but it is unlikely that the stock will face any de-rating.  “However, the market will give credit for the capital work in progress and a premium for the new clean-tech keeping in mind that whenever Reliance has entered a new arena it has become a keystone species in that new ecosystem,” Gupta said.  Also read: Reliance Industries AGM 2022 | Plan to accelerate Rs 75,000 crore investment in new energy: Mukesh Ambani  The future value of course, will be based on it capturing a large percentage of the expected total addressable market (TAM).  The switch to green energy and sustainability will also enhance the firm's environment, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and create a legacy in the highly lucrative green energy industry that will help it attract many foreign investors.  However, Sonam Srivastava, Founder at Wright Research, cautioned “if the mega plan is well executed, it will up the firm’s credibility.

The rally in crude oil prices and the weakness of the rupee to a record-low level against the dollar also dented sentiment, market players said. The day’s selloff left investors poorer by Rs 2.4 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation at Rs 280 lakh crore now.Late on Friday, the US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell had said that the central bank was ready for a tough fight against inflation, even at the cost of growth and employment. These triggered concerns globally with leading American indices closing deep in the red. Subsequently, there were fears other global markets would also see selloffs when trading begins in the new week.On Dalal Street, the session began on a weak note with the sensex at 57,367 points, which was also the day’s low. But it soon recovered some lost ground, treading in a narrow band through the session and closed 1.5% lower. On the NSE, the Nifty followed an identical path and closed at 17,313 points, down 246 points or 1.4%.Software exporters and banking stocks led the slide as analysts see some tough times for these sectors. Reliance Industries, which had its annual shareholders’ meeting during the session, also closed lower and contributed to the sensex’s fall.After recording net positive flows for several weeks since mid-July, foreign investors are again recording net outflows on a regular basis. And market players warned that if the depreciation of the rupee continues, selling by these fund managers may pick up pace. On Monday, foreign funds recorded a net outflow figure of Rs 561 crore, official data showed.“Near-term weakness might continue…given weak global economic cues, crude hovering around $100-per-barrel level and rupee depreciating below the 80 levels,” said Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services. On Monday evening, Brent crude prices were trading around the $102.6 per barrel level, up 1.6% on the day. In the short run, the domestic market is expected to be guided by India’s first quarter GDP numbers, the rupee’s trajectory and how the trend of the global markets, analysts said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to raise the share of gas in India's energy mix to 15% by 2030 from 6.2%, helping it progress towards meeting a 2070 net zero carbon-emission goal. To incentivise gas producers and boost local output, since 2014 India has linked local gas prices to a formula tied to global benchmarks, including Henry Hub, Alberta gas, NBP and Russian gas. In 2016, the country began fixing the ceiling prices of gas produced from ultra-deep water and challenging fields and allowed marketing freedom to the operators of these fields. The state-set local gas prices and ceiling rates are at a record high and are expected to rise further due to a surge in global gas prices triggered by the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The panel has to submit its report by end of this month, according to the order. The committee, headed by energy expert Kirit Parikh, will include members from the fertiliser ministry, as well as gas producers and buyers. Apart from ensuring fair prices to end consumers, the panel will also suggest a 'market oriented, transparent and reliable pricing regime for India's long term vision for ensuring a gas based economy,"" the order said. A government source said the panel's recommendations will not be reflected in the next six-month revision of local gas prices from October, as cabinet approval is required for implementation. India's fertiliser and oil minister did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Higher gas prices tend to boost the earnings of producers like Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd, Oil India Ltd and Reliance Industries but also stoke inflation as prices turns costly for households, industries, and the fertiliser, power and transport sectors. IInflation peaked at 7.79% in April before easing in the last three months, but has remained above the Reserve Bank of India's mandated target band of 2%-6% for seven consecutive months.

African volumes upIndia's monthly Russian oil buying has fallen since hitting a record high in June.About 2 million tonnes (14.35 million barrels) of Russian crude have been loaded for India so far this month versus 3.55 million tonnes of August, including 585,090 tonnes of ESPO crude, Refinitiv data showed on Thursday.In contrast, India has loaded 2.35 million tonnes of African oil so far this month versus 1.16 million tonnes in August, the data showed.Overall, India is likely to lift less crude in September due to planned maintenance shutdowns of units at some refineries operated by companies including Indian Oil Corp Reliance Industries, Bharat Petroleum and Nayara Energy.Middle East producers have also cut official selling prices for their supplies in October, hitting the appeal of Russian oil, said Ehsan Ul Haq, an analyst with Refinitiv.While supplies from Russia to India takes about a month, Middle Eastern crude arrives in a week, he added.Shiptracking data from Kpler showed that all but one seaborne ESPO cargo for September departure are heading to China.Russian ESPO exports in September slipped to 720,000 barrels per day (bpd) from more than 800,000 bpd in July and August, the data showed.""ESPO from the Far East is a short-haul journey for China and freight rates have also risen. So China is taking more oil from the Far East and not so much from Baltic or Black Sea ports,"" Haq said.Russia's local crude processing has also increased, curtailing supplies for export, he said.

The Mumbai-based billionaire has picked a manager to hire staff for the new entity and get it running, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. The Ambanis have also chosen real estate, one of the people said. A spokesman for Reliance, who also represents Ambani, wasn’t available for comment.Ambani is the latest in a series of ultra-rich people to pick Singapore for their family offices — the organizations set up to manage the affairs of wealthy clans — joining the likes of hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio and Google co-founder Sergey Brin.The city-state has become an attractive hub for family offices thanks to its low taxes and relative security. The Monetary Authority of Singapore estimates about 700 were in place by the end of 2021, up from 400 a year earlier. But the rising number of global rich crowding Singapore’s shores is also resulting in higher prices for cars, housing and other goods. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong signaled in an August interview that the wealthy may face more taxes to boost inclusive growth.Ambani’s move to set up the family office ties in with his larger vision of taking his retail-to-refining empire global and acquiring assets outside India. While announcing the appointment of Aramco’s chairman on the board of Reliance in 2021, the billionaire told his shareholders that this marked “the beginning of internationalization” of his conglomerate, without elaborating. “You will hear more about our international plans in the times to come,” he had said at the time.Reliance paid $79 million for Stoke Park Ltd. in April 2021, adding an iconic UK locale that’s been the setting for two James Bond films. It also bought an indirect 73.4% stake in Mandarin Oriental New York for $98.15 million in January and an $80 million beach-side villa in Dubai this year.Ambani, who is worth an estimated $83.7 billion according to the Bloomberg Wealth Index, wants the Singapore family office to be running within a year, one of the people said. His wife Nita Ambani is also helping to set it up, the people added.Reliance has been pivoting from its legacy oil refining and petrochemicals business toward e-commerce, green energy and the expansion of its retail footprint across India. In 2020, its technology venture Jio Platforms Ltd. lured more than $25 billion from marquee Silicon Valley investors including Meta Platforms Inc. and Google.

The amended norm took effect on Thursday.The move is expected to make modules costlier by 33-34%, E&Y tax partner Saurabh Agarwal told TOI, adding, however, the government’s intent appears to promote domestic manufacturing.The project imports scheme allows import of machinery, instruments and apparatus etc needed for setting up new units or expansion of an existing unit at a concessional duty of 5%.Solar promoters whose projects were already underway when the government announced in 2021 its intent to impose 40% basic customs duty on cells and modules from April 2022 took refuge under the scheme as utilities refused to bear the additional cost.After the 2021 announcement, discoms (distribution companies) refused to pay a single paisa more than the tariff discovered through bidding and threatened to cancel the power purchase agreements, head of a Delhi-based solar major said requesting anonymity.The concessional duty was an option that gave developers some safeguard for their investments, he said, adding now the promoters face the prospect of their PPAs being cancelled by utilities.An industry analyst said 10,000 MW capacity auctioned before 2021 and about 5,000 MW capacity that are expected to be commissioned in the current fiscal will be particularly vulnerable to the latest change in duty structure.He said moving forward, the latest duty tweak will give an edge to players that have major manufacturing plans such as Reliance Industries Ltd, the Adani group and others.There were some players who said the loss of concessional duty could disturb the pace of capacity addition and impact the target of achieving 500 gigawatts capacity by 2030.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/solar-projects-lose-duty-sop-rs-25-k-crore-investment-may-be-hit/articleshow/94993980.cms,1

Profit will be driven by strong consolidated revenue, which is expected to rise 34 percent on year on year to Rs 2.25 lakh crore in the quarter.    Revenue will be aided by strength in the energy business, which will benefit from better gross refining margins and strong demand compared to the year-ago quarter.

Energy business   While the year-on-year performance of RIL’s oil-to-chemical vertical will be strong, its sequential growth could have been soft due to a decline in global gross refining margins from their lifetime highs in the June quarter as well as the imposition of additional duties on the export of refining products imposed by the government.  “Energy markets have been volatile in the past quarter, and windfall taxes added to challenges,” Morgan Stanley, which has an ‘overweight’ rating on RIL, wrote in a preview on the earnings.  Morgan Stanley said RIL’s earnings may have fallen sequentially as the oil-to-chemicals business was affected by refinery shutdowns, the windfall fuel export tax, and lower product cracks.  Singapore’s Gross Refining Margin (GRM), a key benchmark to gauge refining margins in Asia, plummeted 51 percent sequentially to $9.1 per barrel in the September quarter because of a decline in gasoline and fuel oil cracks.  The sharp decline in the Singapore GRM will have an impact on RIL’s margin, but continued strength in middle distillate products like diesel and air turbine fuel should have offset some of the impact, analysts said.  Retail and telecom   Analysts expect no surprises in the earnings performance of Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio Infocomm in the September quarter. On a sequential basis, both verticals are expected to have performed well, driven by high customer acquisitions in telecom and strong footfalls in retail.  IIFL Securities sees the retail segment registering 36 percent on-year growth in sales and a 7.5 percent core margin in the September quarter.  On the telecom side, acquisition of new customers and recent tariff hikes should result in 3-5 percent sequential growth in revenue.  Analysts expect the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) of Reliance Jio to rise 1.9 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis from Rs 176 reported in the previous quarter.  Jio is estimated to have added more than 9 million net new users in the September quarter, analysts said.  “Sequential ARPU improvement is backed by residual impact of the past tariff hike (higher proportion of longer-dated plans),” Emkay Global Financial Services said.

RIL's consoli,"NEW DELHI: India's most valuable company Reliance Industries on Friday reported a flat profit for the second quarter of the financial year 2022-23. RIL's consolidated net profit stood at Rs 13,656 crore in Q2 as against a profit of Rs 13,680 crore in same period last fiscal. The Mukesh Ambani-led firm's profits tumbled after its mainstay oil-to-chemical business was impacted by a fall in refinery margins and export tax on refined fuels. In terms of quarterly numbers, RIL's profit plunged about 24%.The oil-to-chemical (O2C) business that witnessed a great run over the past few quarters on higher demand for transportation fuels, helped by cheap Russian crude, saw refinery margins cooling off from record highs in the quarter.A bigger shock came in the form of windfall tax on exports of gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel levied by the government of India.The export duty adversely impacted profit for the quarter by Rs 4,039 crore, Reliance said.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the O2C segment dropped 5.9% year-on-year to Rs 11,968 crore.Reliance also shut a crude distillation unit and gasoline making fluid catalytic cracker at Jamnagar in Gujarat in September for usual maintenance. If not for the windfall profit tax, the net profit would have been 20 per cent higher.The windfall profit tax cost the company Rs 4,039 crore in the quarter, lowering pre-tax earnings from the O2C business by almost 6 per cent to Rs 11,968 crore.The O2C earnings also fell because of lower refining margins and the company's oil refinery taking a planned maintenance shutdown during the quarter, lowering the output.This was offset by a 27 per cent jump in the net profit of its digital arm Jio Platforms to Rs 4,729 crore and a 51 per jump in pre-tax earnings from the retail business of Rs 4,404 crore. The firm's revenues from oil and gas production rose 3x to Rs 3,171 crore.This is the first quarterly dip in profit that the company has reported since January-March.Commenting on the results, Mukesh D Ambani, chairman and managing director, Reliance Industries Limited, said the quarter saw record performance in the company's consumer businesses, which continue to scale new milestones every quarter.""We saw consistent net subscriber additions and higher engagement in the digital services segment,"" he said. ""Jio has announced a beta trial for its industry-leading standalone 5G services and is making rapid progress for an ambitious and the fastest ever roll out of True 5G on a pan-India basis.""The retail business delivered record performance with a strong revival in footfalls, store additions and digital integration, he noted.""Performance of our O2C business reflects subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products. Transportation fuel margins were better than last year but significantly lower sequentially,"" he said.""Segment performance was also impacted by the introduction of special additional excise duties (windfall profit tax) during the quarter to ensure stable supply and lower volatility in the domestic market.""Reliance Jio Infocomm, the nation's largest telecom operator by subscribers, saw continued to see an uptick in per-user revenue - Rs 177.2 per subscriber per month in Q2 from Rs 175.7 per user per month in the previous month.

Revenue growth also reflected continued growth momentum across consumer businesses, the company said","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries on October 21 reported a record performance in consumer businesses which continued to scale new milestones every quarter, but its performance in the O2C (oil-to-chemical) business reflected subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products.  Here are 10 key highlights from the quarterly earnings scorecard:  1) Profit  Reliance registered a 0.2 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated profit at Rs 15,512 crore for the quarter ended September FY23, with cash profit growing 15.4 percent to Rs 27,614 crore for the same period.  Its other income during the quarter fell by 16.8 percent to Rs 3,514 crore YoY.  2) Topline  The gross revenue for the quarter at Rs 2.53 lakh crore was higher by 32.4 percent compared to year-ago period, while revenue from operations increased by 33.7 percent to Rs 2.32 lakh crore.  The increase of 32.4 percent in gross revenue was driven by higher realization in O2C business with sharp increase in energy prices. Revenue growth also reflects continued growth momentum across consumer businesses, the company said.  Also read - RIL to demerge financial services undertaking and list Jio Financial Services  3) Operating Performance  At the operating level, Reliance said EBITDA (excluding the impact of special additional excise duty related costs of Rs 4,039 crore) for the quarter was Rs 38,702 crore, a 27.8 percent growth over a year-ago period. EBITDA including the impact of special additional excise duty stood at Rs 34,663 crore, up 14.5 percent YoY.  The growth in EBITDA was driven by positive operating leverage and operational efficiencies in retail segment, higher gas price realization with increase in ceiling price, increase in ARPU and customer engagement in digital services segment.  4) Finance Cost  Reliance said its finance cost increased by 19.2 percent to Rs 4,554 crore during the quarter YoY, due to higher loan balances and tightening of monetary policy by central banks.  5) Debts and Cash  It has an outstanding debt as of September 2022 of Rs 2.94 lakh crore or $36.2 billion, while the cash and cash equivalents were at Rs 2.01 lakh crore ($24.8 billion).  The capital expenditure for the quarter was Rs 32,534 crore and additionally, it incurred expenses of Rs 88,078 crore for acquisition of spectrum by RJIL.  Also read - Reliance Retail reports 36% YoY jump in Q2 net profit to Rs 2,305 crore  6) Jio Platforms  Jio Platforms, which owns Jio, recorded a 26.9 percent year-on-year growth in profit at Rs 4,729 crore for the quarter ended September FY23, backed by strong topline and operating performance.  Revenue from operations for the quarter at Rs 24,275 crore for the quarter increased by 22.7 percent year-on-year aided by increase in average revenue per user (ARPU).  ARPU during the quarter at Rs 177.2 per subscriber per month grew at a healthy pace of 23.5 percent growth on YoY basis, while the data traffic increased by 22.7 percent YoY to 28.2 billion GB during the quarter.  Total customer base of Jio as of September FY23 stood at 427.6 million.  &quot;We saw consistent net subscriber additions and higher engagement in digital services segment,&quot; said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director.  Jio Platforms registered a massive 29.2 percent year-on-year growth in EBITDA at Rs 12,011 crore driven by strong revenue growth and margin improvement. The margin at 49.5 percent expanded by 250 bps YoY due to increase in ARPU, which partly offset by inflationary pressure on operating costs.  7) Reliance Retail  Reliance Retail delivered record revenue and profits during the quarter led by broad-based growth across all consumer baskets, with revenue growing a massive 44.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 57,694 crore and profit increasing 36 percent YoY to Rs 2,305 crore.  The business expanded its physical store network with 795 new store openings, taking the total store count at the end of the quarter to 16,617 stores with an area of 54.5 million square feet, Reliance said.  Retail EBITDA from operations increased 75.9 percent YoY to Rs 4,286 crore in Q2FY23, with a 130 basis point margin improvement over the same time last year resulting from favourable mix, positive operating leverage and operational efficiencies.  As consumers returned to stores, Reliance Retail received over 180 million footfalls across formats and geographies in the quarter, a growth of 23 percent over pre-COVID period, the company said.  8) Oil To Chemicals  The oil to chemicals (O2C) business reported a 32.5 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1.59 lakh crore, primarily on account of higher crude oil prices.  Crude oil benchmarks rose YoY due to recovering oil demand, aggressive production cuts announced by OPEC+, limited spare capacity and imminent European Union sanctions on Russian oil exports. Dated Brent crude averaged $100.9 a barrel in Q2FY23, rising by $27.4 a barrel YoY, but declined by $13 per barrel QoQ.  RIL's production meant for sale was lower by 3.6 percent YoY to 16.2 MMT with planned turnaround of primary and secondary units of SEZ refinery for maintenance &amp;amp; inspection.  &quot;Performance of O2C business reflect subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products. Transportation fuel margins were better than last year but significantly lower sequentially,&quot; Mukesh Ambani said.  He further said the segment performance was also impacted by the introduction of special additional excise duties during the quarter to ensure stable supply and lower volatility in the domestic market.  At the operating level, its EBITDA declined by 5.9 percent YoY to Rs 11,968 crore primarily on account of introduction of special additional excise duty on transportation fuels and lower polymer deltas, with margin falling by 310 bps YoY to 7.5 percent.  9) Exports  Exports (including deemed exports) from RIL's India operations increased by 57.5 percent to Rs 86,382 crore compared to year-ago period, mainly due to higher price realizations despite lower downstream product volumes.  10) Oil &amp;amp; Gas  &quot;Domestic oil &amp;amp; gas business continued to deliver robust performance maintaining production at 19 MMSCMD levels in the KG D6 block, significantly enhancing energy security for the country. We are confident of commissioning MJ Fields by year-end,&quot; Mukesh Ambani said.  The oil &amp;amp; gas segment clocked a 134.4 percent YoY growth in revenue at Rs 3,853 crore led by higher production and improved gas price realization.  KG-D6 gas production during the quarter was at 41 BCF (RIL's share) against 39.2 BCF (billions of cubic feet) production in Q2FY22.  Average gas price realisation for KG-D6 increased sharply to $9.86 per metric million British thermal unit (MMBTU) during the quarter compared to $3.62 per MMBTU in Q2FY22, with raising of gas price ceiling by the Government of India for first half of FY23, Reliance said.  Oil &amp;amp; gas segment reported nearly 3 times YoY increase in EBITDA to Rs 3,171 crore for the quarter, with margin expanding by 12.6 percentage points to 82.3 percent.

However, the segment's operating profit fell 5.9 percent on-year to Rs 11,968 crore owing to decline in global refining margins and government's special excise duty.  &quot;Performance of our O2C business reflect subdued demand and weak margin environment across downstream chemical products,&quot; Ambani said.  RIL’s production meant for sale was lower by 3.6 percent year-on-year with planned turnaround of primary and secondary units of special economic zone (SEZ) refinery for M&amp;amp;A.  RIL said its joint venture with Bp continued to face adverse market conditions due to retail fuel prices remaining capped despite higher global crude oil prices.  &quot;Jio-bp is committed to safeguarding interest of channel partners while meeting universal service obligations,&quot; RIL said.  Jio Platforms  The digital services business of RIL, which included Reliance Jio, had a strong quarter on a sequential basis.  The segment's operating profit jumped 5.1 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis to Rs 12,011 crore, aided by strong addition of new customers and benefit of recent tariff hikes at the telecom subsidiary.  Reliance Jio added net new subscribers to the tune of 7.7 million in the September quarter, taking the total user base to 427.6 million as of September 30.  The operating margin of the digital services business also saw a marked improvement to 49.5 percent in the reported quarter from 48.7 percent in the previous quarter.  Organised Retail  The organised retail segment had a record quarter, aided by the full re-opening of the domestic economy post the COVID-19 related restrictions seen through large parts of 2021-22.  The segment's revenues jumped 44.5 percent on-year to Rs 57,694 crore in the reported quarter, which was aided by strong new store additions and footfalls. RIL said it received over 180 million footfalls in the September quarter, which was a 23 percent jump over pre-COVID-19 levels.  During the quarter, the company opened 795 new stores to take the total store count to 16,617.  &quot;The quarter was marked by an operating environment at par with pre-COVID levels as the impact of pandemic waned,&quot; RIL said.  The oil-to-chemical major said that across town classes, consumer sentiments remained positive on the back of key promotional events and early onset of festivities.  &quot;Overall, the results reflect strong operational execution that keeps it well poised to deliver sustainable growth in the period ahead,&quot; RIL said.  Oil &amp;amp; Gas  The oil and gas production business of RIL benefitted from the surge in domestic administered natural gas prices during the quarter.  RIL reported a 134.4 percent year-on-year surge in revenues to Rs 3,853 crore, driven by higher realisation for the natural gas that the company produces from difficult-to-produce fields.  Operating profit of the segment nearly tripled on a year-on-year basis to Rs 3,171 crore in the quarter while operating margins rose 17.2 percentage points to 82.3 percent.  During the quarter, RIL produced 43.6 billions of cubic feet equivalent as against 52 billions of cubic feet equivalent in the year ago quarter.  Media  The media and broadcasting business reported a 11.7 percent year-on-year growth in revenues to Rs 1,549 crore during the reported quarter.  The segment's operating profit plummeted 87.4 percent on-year to Rs 32 crore while operating margins shrank to 2.1 percent from 18.2 percent a year-ago.  RIL said that the business faced issues from a challenging advertising environment, flat subscription revenue and advertisement revenue loss from removal of Hindi GEC from DD FreeDish.  &quot;Advertising environment during the quarter was subdued as brands held back advertising spends on new product launches and sustenance campaigns due to the continued inflationary headwinds,&quot; RIL said.  On October 21, shares of Reliance Industries ended 1.2 percent lower at Rs 2,470 on the NSE.  (Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

On a sequential basis, the profit grew by 4 percent.  The company recorded revenue of Rs 22,521 crore for the quarter under review, up 20 percent from a year ago. Sequentially, revenue increased by 3 percent.  Performance was driven by higher net customer additions and an increase in average revenue per user.  The average revenue per user (ARPU) at Rs 177.2 per subscriber per month saw a healthy 23.5 percent growth compared to the year-ago period due to better seasonality and improving subscriber mix, Reliance Industries said in its BSE filing.  The net subscriber addition was healthy at 7.7 million as gross addition remained strong at 32.7 million in Q2FY23.

Jio aims to complete its pan India 5G rollout by December 2023.  Meanwhile, Jio Platforms clocked a healthy 26.9 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated profit at Rs 4,729 crore for the quarter ended September FY23, backed topline as well as operating performance.  The revenue from operations grew by 22.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 24,275 crore driven by an ARPU increase for the connectivity business.  At the operating level, Jio Platforms recorded a 29.2 percent year-on-year increase in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) at Rs 12,011 crore led by strong revenue growth and margin improvement.  The margin at 49.5 percent increased by 250 bps YoY due to ARPU's increase in connectivity business partly offset by inflationary pressure on operating costs, Reliance said.

It has now brought this homegrown brand to the front end by opening its first EBO (exclusive brand outlet) at Gurugram in NCR in the last quarter with a store size of 1,400 sq feet.Under this new format, Reliance Retail, the retail arm of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries, will have a range of affordable toys not only from the brand Rowan on its shelves but also from other brands, said an industry source.Reliance Retail also has the iconic British toy retail brand Hamleys in its fold.Hamleys is the world's oldest toy retailer and was acquired by Reliance in 2019, marking the first acquisition of a global retail brand by the company.Hamleys would continue to operate in the premium space, while brand Rowan would help Reliance Retail to tap the mid-premium and mass segment with its affordable offerings, the source said.The unit value of toys will be much lower at Rowan stores, and the discounts offered will be higher. Hence, products will be more affordable, he added.Moreover, unlike Hamleys, the store size of Rowan stores will be much smaller, ideally measuring between 500-1,000 sq ft, he noted.""We also launched Rowan, which is a new format from Reliance as a toy store, which is a small format, typically around 500-1,000 sq ft in size, selling more affordable toys. So, that format also got launched during this quarter, and we'll also see it further ramp up as we go along,"" Reliance Retail Head of strategy and business development Gaurav Jain said.Hamleys currently has a global footprint across 15 countries with over 200 doors and is India's largest chain of toy stores.With both brands in its portfolio, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) is one of the leading toy distributors.Earlier in June this year, Reliance Brands Ltd (RBL), a unit of RRVL, had announced a joint venture with Italian company Plastic Legno SPA and acquired a 40 per cent stake in the latter's toy manufacturing business in India.According to a joint report by industry body FICCI and KPMG, the Indian toy market was estimated to be around $ 1 billion in 2019-20 and is expected to double to $2 billion by 2024-25.

The community participation in the proposed Naupang League will add a different dimension to the competition as it will be a collective participation of kids, parents and the local community which will drive and motivate the team like never before and fuel the competitiveness of the league. The pilot project in Mizoram which we are confident will be successful, can be used as a blueprint for grassroots development, and the first of its kind, in Indian football.

The age categories begin at Under-6 and continue until Under 13 years with multiple game formats. A minimum of 30 games will be played by the kids. RF Young Champs will further integrate with RF Youth Sports in the region to ensure additional games and competitive exposure to deserving players. The Mizoram football ecosystem is set to benefit immensely from Reliance Foundation's Young Champs as its programs include coach education and development; referee development; weekly coaching program for kids; quarterly camps (local) for emerging elite; enablement of Inter-District championship; and Reliance Foundation Young Champs camps in Mumbai to understate match day operations better.

But the similarity does not end here. The leopard seldom downs bigger prey, like an adult sambar leaving them for the tiger. The Shikra, too, finds it difficult to hunt down from an over-abundance of urban pigeons, leaving them to larger-sized but uncommon Peregrine/Shaheen falcons and Eurasian sparrowhawks. A number of field observations and photographs of Shikra and its prey from the Tricity have brought to light its standard, “manageable” prey menu: bulbuls, garden lizards, squirrels, sparrow chicks etc but kills of a pigeon are seldom reported. A recent, chance photograph of a Shikra on a pigeon kill from a Sector 18 B bungalow is more the exception than the norm for a predator immortalised by the poetic analogies of Shiv Batalvi and by falconers of erstwhile royals. The pigeon killed by the Shikra in Sector 18 B was not an adult but a fledgling nearing the stage of its maiden flight. While Batalvi subtly deployed the ruthless qualities of the Shikra to spin a poetry of crushed love and an innocent, yearning heart carved out by a blood-stained beak, court falconers of the maharajas would train Shikras as the raptor was easily schooled and would hunt down food for the larger royal falcons, eagles and goshawks. A trained and large female Shikra — as compared to its wilderness state where it prefers small, manageable quarry — was even taught to strike at prey such as a young peacock and Egyptian vulture by falconers of repute as the late RS Dharmakumarsinhji of Bhavnagar state. The etymology of the common name, Shikra, derived from “Persian via Urdu, in Hindi, shikari denotes ‘hunter’”, as explained by the reputed raptor expert and billionaire Godrej heir, Rishad Naoroji.“If a Shikra is able to kill a pigeon, which is seldom the case, it is likely the pigeon was a chick or the adult pigeon was wounded, sick or debilitated in some manner. Just as a leopard will hunt a fawn but dare not take on a male sambar because apart from its unmanageable size, one kick from its powerful hind leg could disable or churn the innards out of the clinging leopard,” Sarfrazuddin Malik, who works on rehabilitating wounded / sick migratory raptors and trained on these birds of prey at the Ahmedabad zoo, in California and with the hereditary Punjabi Pathan falconers of the Bhavnagar royals, told TOI.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/humble-pigeon-vs-famed-hawk-of-badshahs-batalvi/articleshow/95218380.cms,2

The proposed deal will mark Metro’s exit from one of the world’s fastest-growing markets, which it had entered 19 years ago with big hopes.Sources said Metro has agreed to RIL’s purchase deal for its local cash-and-carry business, which also includes the Indian conglomerate retaining the former’s employees for at least one year. RIL, India’s largest company in terms of market value, will also gain Metro’s wholesale centers across the country and land assets as part of the transaction. RIL declined to comment on the report. It, however, said that the company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis. RIL is the country’s largest organised retailer in terms of store network and the proposed buy of Metro’s wholesale unit will further deepen its operations. Reliance Retail is perhaps the only company in the country that has both front- and back-end capabilities to absorb the operations of Metro’s India cash and carry operations, a source said, adding that whether it is to supplying to kiranas through its online grocery service JioMart, using Metro’s wholesale centres as warehouses or fine-tuning Metro’s sourcing at the back-end to benefit local MSMEs. RIL’s retail interests are routed through its subsidiary Reliance Retail Ventures, in which marquee international investors like Mubadala, ADIA and PIF own stakes. Ambani built the retail unit using cash from his core refining and petrochemical business, enticing customers with superior value, revered international labels and acquisitions. Reliance Retail is the country’s largest (with 16,547 stores) and most profitable (Rs 12,381 crore in FY22) retailer. In the second quarter of this fiscal, it had acquired a majority stake in makeup brand Insight Cosmetics. RIL and Metro have been engaged in discussions for a potential deal for some time now but differences over valuation slowed the process. Both have now agreed to shake hands, another source said.The dynamics of the wholesale business in India, low margins, among other factors, has forced the German wholesaler to evaluate its India strategy including an exit. In 2014, France-based Carrefour exited the wholesale business in India. Six years later, Flipkart had acquired Walmart India, operator of Best Price cash-and-carry business.Metro forayed into the country in 2003 and currently operates more than 30 wholesale distribution centers, catering to business customers only.

Seaborne imports into the region surged to an all-time high of 7.5 million tons in October, surpassing the previous record of 6.6 million mt in November 2021 by a whopping 13.6 percent, Refinitiv assessments show.Now that winter is approaching, demand for diesel will peak in Europe, exacerbated by a full import ban on seaborne Russian oil imports and spiralling gas prices made worse by outages to the Nord Stream gas pipeline that has spurred gasto-oil switching for power-generation, which could blowout in the event of a harsher and prolonged winter.Europe is looking at suppliers in Asia to meet some of their supply gap, particularly for winter-specification diesel, with India and South Korea emerging as the main suppliers.According to the report, Indian refiners are taking advantage of both strong gasoil margins, which saw front-month 10-ppm gasoil/Dubai cracks soar to multiple record-highs that culminated in the all-time high of above $70 per barrel, and steeply discounted Russian crudes, which they have imported at almost 10 times the volume vs pre-invasion levels, at 2.82 million mt/month during March- September.Reliance has emerged as the country’s largest importer of Russian crudes and is also its largest diesel exporter. Its 5.68 million mt/month capacity plant has been running at 93.8% post-invasion, above the pre-invasion average of 92.3%, but still below the pre-Covid 2015-2019 average of 110%, signalling that there is upside to its diesel production, noted the report.""Runs averaged at 99.86% of the country’s 5.14 million bpd capacity post-invasion, versus the pre-invasion average of 94.26%. Gasoil output averaged at 9.75 million mt/month for March-August and hit a record-high of 10.57 million mt in March, well above the pre-invasion average of 8.95 million mt/month,"" it added.However, only private refiners Reliance and Nayara Energy can produce EU winter-specification diesel. The other state-owned refiners have focused their output to cover domestic demand, which are also rising in October, after the low-demand monsoon season ended. India's fuel consumption rose to its highest in four months in October, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the oil ministry showed on Monday.Consumption in October was 6.7% higher than September, while also up 3.4% year-on-year at 18.37 million tonnes, the data showed.Sales of gasoline, or petrol, were up 8.8% from 2021 at 2.99 million tonnes, while diesel rose 5.5% at 6.98 million tonnes, the PPAC showed.Cooking gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) sales decreased 3.3% to 2.40 million tonnes, while naphtha sales fell 24% to 0.96 million tonnes.Sales of bitumen, used for making roads, were 11.4% lower, while fuel oil use edged up 1% in October.The data indicates that ""the negative impact of the monsoon season is now coming to an end,"" Refinitiv analyst Ehsan Ul Haq said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/winter-is-coming-and-its-advantage-reliance-amid-a-looming-energy-crisis/articleshow/95417471.cms,0

Shah and M.M. Sundresh said: ""Issue notice to the respondent, making it returnable on December 2, 2022. Abhishek Singh, counsel accepts service of notice on behalf of the respondent.""Senior advocate Harish N. Salve, appearing on behalf of RIL, vehemently submitted that despite the August 5 order passed by the apex court by which the respondent (Sebi) was directed to furnish a copy of the documents, the same has not been furnished till date.Senior advocate and former Attorney General of India K.K. Venugopal, representing Sebi, submitted that the review petition preferred by the respondent is pending before this court and, therefore, no further order be passed in the present proceedings.The bench, in its order, noted: ""We have gone through the subsequent order passed by this court dated October 12, 2022 in review petition. The pendency of an appeal and/or writ petition along with stay cannot be equated with pendency of the review petition.""There is a final decision by this court in an appeal. Merely because the stay application is pending in review petition cannot be a ground to grant stay by the respondent on its own and not to comply with the directions issued by this court.""The bench said it is required to be noted that the State of J&K Vs. Mohd. Yaqoob Khan and others was a case where against the ex-parte order passed by the single judge, pending writ petition, the contempt proceedings were initiated. ""Therefore, this court observed that when the stay application is yet to be heard and decided and disposed of, the contempt proceedings cannot be initiated. Under the circumstances, the said decision(s) cannot be of any assistance to the respondent,"" said the apex court.The bench has scheduled the matter for further hearing on December 2.The company had sought three documents from Sebi that it had claimed would exonerate it and its promoters from criminal prosecution initiated in a case related to the alleged irregularities in acquisition of its own shares between 1994 and 2000.On August 5, a bench led by then Chief Justice N.V. Ramana, had said: ""The approach of Sebi, in failing to disclose the documents, also raises concerns of transparency and fair trial. Opaqueness only propagates prejudice and partiality. Opaqueness is antithetical to transparency.""The top court had said the market regulator should show fairness and furnish documents sought by RIL, and Sebi has a duty to act fairly, while conducting proceedings or initiating any action against the parties.RIL filed a contempt petition as Sebi has not shared three documents -- the two legal opinions by former Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna and former ICAI President Y.H. Malegam's report which examined the irregularities. The company claimed that Sebi cannot continue to resist the production of these documents and it had also sent a notice to the market regulator saying if documents were not received by August 18, then it will establish that Sebi does not want to comply with the apex court's judgment.In 2002, chartered accountant S. Gurumurthy filed a complaint with Sebi alleging irregularities by RIL, its associate companies and their directors/promoters, including Mukesh Ambani and his wife, Nita; Anil Ambani and his wife, Tina; and 98 others. The complaint cited the issue of two preferential placement of non-convertible debentures in 1994.Sebi had alleged that RIL along with Reliance Petroleum had circuitously funded the acquisition of its own shares in violation of the Sections 77 and 77A of the Companies Act, 1956.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sc-issues-contempt-notice-to-sebi-on-ril-plea-on-non-compliance-of-court-order/articleshow/95444395.cms,1

Asia's richest man Gautam Adani last week said the economy will become a $30-trillion economy by 2050 on the back of rising consumption and socio-economic reforms. Several foreign brokerages too believe India is among the fastest growing economies in the world while many of the big and advanced economies like the US and UK are already staring at a prolonged recession. A recent report by Morgan Stanley titled “Why this is India's decade”, states that “four global trends of Demographics, Digitalization, Decarbonization and Deglobalization” imply that India is set to become the third-largest economy within the coming decade.Morgan Stanley expects India’s GDP to surpass $7.5 trillion by 2031, more than double current levels. It also expects India's per-capita income to rise from $2,278 now to $5,242 by 2031, setting the stage for a discretionary spending boom.Moreover, the number of households earning more than $35,000/year is likely to rise fivefold in the coming decade, to over 25 million. 95730020""Incrementally, India will add more than $400 billion to its GDP every year, a scale that is only surpassed by the US and China,"" Morgan Stanley's chief Asia economist Chetan Ahya wrote in the Financial Times.A confluence of favourable domestic and global forces supports the projection, while there has also been a shift in government's policy approach from redistribution to boosting investment and job creation.According to Ahya, tax reforms in the form of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a cut in the corporate tax rate, and the introduction of production-linked incentive schemes are examples of shifts in government policy.And there are three primary reasons why India has the conditions in place for an economic boom. These include: 1. Offshoring:  95730004“The pandemic only enhanced India's attractiveness as the office to the world... in the post-Covid environment, global CEOs appear more comfortable with both work from home and work from India. The emergence of distributed delivery models, along with tighter labor markets globally, has accelerated outsourcing to India.” According to MS, during the two pandemic years, the number of people employed in this industry in India rose from 4.3 million to 5.1 million, and the country's share of global services trade rose 60 basis points (bps) to 4.3%. In the coming decade, the number of people employed in India for jobs outside the country is likely to at least double to over 11 million, and MS estimates that the global spending on outsourcing could rise from $180 billion per year to around $500 billion by 2030.And, apart from being an office to the world, India will also become the factory to the world. “We anticipate a wave of manufacturing capex owing to government policies aimed at lifting corporate profits' share of GDP via tax cuts and hard dollars for investing in specific sectors, and we note that performance-linked incentive (PLI) schemes now total $33 billion across 14 sectors. Multinationals are more optimistic than ever about investing in India, as the all-time high on our MNC Sentiment Index shows,” it said.2. Digital differentiationMS pointed out that “India is pursuing a distinct model for the digitalization of its economy, supported by a public utility called IndiaStack”. It further said that IndiaStack — which operates at a population scale, is a transaction-led, low-cost, high-volume, small-ticket-size system with embedded lending — will take India from a 'prepaid' economy to a 'postpaid' (buy now, pay later) one. 95730323 95730336 957303603. Energy transition: While the first two drivers are unique to India, the world has seen energy transitions before. 95730159""The difference for India is that both its energy consumption and energy sources are changing simultaneously in a disruptive fashion. Another difference is that India's energy needs are still growing,and therefore legacy capacity using fossil fuels will not be destroyed as it transitions to a higher share of renewables. India's per-capita energy consumption is likely to rise 60%, on our estimates, to about 1450 Watts per day in the coming decade, with two-thirds of the incremental supply coming from renewable sources. We believe this will 1) positively impact India’s terms of trade,2)entail about three-quarters of a trillion dollars in energy capex,3)eventually reduce headline inflation volatility as the imported energy share of GDP declines, 4) lower fertilizer subsidies,5) improve living conditions,and 6) create new demand for solutions such as electric vehicles, cold-storage chains,and green hydrogen-powered trucks and buses."" Supporting these factors are India's rise in the world economy, its commitment to the Paris Accord and major investments in terms of both dollars and institutional infrastructure to leverage India's biometric identity system, Aadhaar,and)government policies targeted at lifting the share of profits in GDP, with a concomitant positive effect on investment.""India is entering a phase where incomes will be compounding at a fast rate on a high base. For context, India took 31 years since 1991 to raise its GDP by $3 trillion. According to our projections, it will take just another seven years for the GDP to grow by an additional $3 trillion,"" said Ahya.Morgan Stanley is not alone in this view.According to a report by IME Capital, India's highly favourable demographics, large & fast-growing middle-class with rising aspirations, incrasing Per Capita Income plus structural reforms like GST, RERA, Financial Inclusion, labour Reforms, manufacturing Focus Policies and a strong Digital Stack make it ripe as investment destination. 95730235 95730250 95730264 95730271 95730281Will China and India become the world's top economies? The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) released a research report in November titled ""The future of global economic power”, which predicts China and India will become the world’s top two economies in the long-term with 27.0 percent and 16.2 percent of 2100 world GDP, respectively. ""If recent productivity continues and demographic projections prove accurate, India will account for one third of world output in 2100 and China for over one fifth. The US output share will grow slightly while other developed countries shrink dramatically,"" said economists Seth G. Benzell and Laurence J. Kotlikoff. Using the UN’s demographic data and IMF economic data, the paper states that ""at the turn of the century, China’s share of world GDP is 27.0 percent, India’s share is 16.2 percent, the US share is 12.3 percent, and Western Europe’s share is 11.9 percent. Hence, in 2100, the 2100 combined Chinese-Indian global GDP share is 43.2 percent compared with 24.5 percent in 2017. The US and the advanced European nations, which jointly accounted for 33.5 percent of world output in 2017, account for only 24.2 percent in 2100.""Under another possible outcome, the paper explain that if one assumes growth rates are the same as the 20 years before 2017, “India now becomes the planet’s super superpower with its 2100 share of the global economy rising from 6.8% to 33.8%.” It would mean an increase in China’s share of world GDP from 15.7% to 22%. Why is India’s 2100 economy 50 percent larger than China’s under this productivity growth rate assumption? The reason is labour productivity""India’s 2100 population is almost 50 percent larger than China’s. And, by 2100, Indian and Chinese labor productivity are equal. Hence, China’s productivity edge vis a vie India dissipates through time,"" said the report.According to the NBER paper, “productivity growth and its interaction with demographic change are the main drivers of future economic power. Fiscal conditions and automation matter are secondary factors.”. This baseline projection also features “an evolving global savings glut, major reductions in the world interest rate, substantial aging-related increases in tax rates, and permanent differences in regional living standards”.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explained-why-mukesh-ambani-and-gautam-adani-are-bullish-about-indian-economy/articleshow/95729983.cms,0

An equity injection of this size is expected to help the conglomerate deleverage and Bloomberg Intelligence sees a successful equity raise across the group supporting the companies' dollar bonds.The billionaire is seeking legitimacy in the face of questions about his group's breakneck expansion from a traditional port operator to a sprawling empire with assets including media, cement and green energy, that critics say has boosted leverage and financial complexity. With this fundraising, in one fell swoop Adani can improve debt ratios, broaden his investor base, improve stock liquidity and trigger wider analyst coverage for a conglomerate that's surprisingly under-covered despite the outsized stock gains. ""The fundraising exercise by Adani Group is putting the naysayers in place,"" said Sanjiv Bhasin, director at Mumbai-based brokerage IIFL Securities Ltd. ""He is embarking on a new fund drive that will boost the credibility of the group and allay the fears of investors.""Yet questions remain over what kind of investors Adani will be able to attract, and whether they can be persuaded to buy in at the astronomical valuations his units trade at. The Adani Group declined to comment. 'Lots of questions'Adani executives are courting global sovereign and pension funds, including Mubadala Investment Co, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. The total fundraising size could be as high as $10 billion, according to people familiar with Adani's thinking.The equity plans come as the 60-year-old seeks to reinvent himself on the global stage. Despite adding more billions to his wealth than any other tycoon this year, Adani has struggled to shed the perception that his meteoric rise has been fueled by support from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Research firm CreditSights in September had put the spotlight on the group's ""elevated"" leverage and lawmakers have sought an investigation into some of the group's investors. ""There are a lot of questions about opacity, about lack of disclosures, valuations obviously. But it's trickier because the businesses will grow if India grows,"" said Vikas Pershad, a fund manager at M&G Investments (Singapore) Pte. ""They are at the right place at the right time."" The board of the flagship company, Adani Enterprises Ltd, is meeting on Friday to discuss fund raising options. Adani Enterprises is trading at a valuation of over 160 times its one-year forward earnings. By comparison, Reliance Industries Ltd -- India's largest firm by market value -- is at about 21 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.""Most Adani stocks are highly valued, so investors have to be careful about taking fresh positions,"" said Mohit Nigam, a fund manager with Hem Securities Ltd. in Jaipur. ""Also how they are going to handle debt will be crucial going forward.""Testing appetiteAdani Enterprises was added to India's benchmark Nifty 50 index in September and its equity sale is likely to draw in a number of passive funds. But merely adding more strategic or passive investors is unlikely to increase liquidity, according to Alice Wang, a portfolio manager at Quaero Capital in London, who estimates the company's free float at about 10%, far lower than the reported 27%.""It will be a pity if it's the same strategic holders participating,"" Wang said. ""But as this might solve their problems without putting pressure on their share price, it's a real fait accompli -- great for the banks, jury still out for the equity holders.""A successful outcome for the tycoon would be to pull off something similar to fellow Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, who raised more than $27 billion in 2020 by selling stakes in units of Reliance Industries to global investors of the likes of Meta Platforms Inc. and Google's parent, Alphabet Inc.Anish Teli, managing partner at QED Capital Advisors LLP in Mumbai, said Adani's expected share sale will be the first of many as the conglomerate drives into new industries.The current plans will not just be ""testing appetite for the stock,"" it will also ""pave the way for further fund raises from institutional investors,"" Teli said.

The spurt in the sensex came on the back of a Rs 936-crore net buying by foreign funds.The day’s gains did not take into account selling pressure in some of the frontline banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) stocks. Mixed global cues too apparently did not have any impact, which is making a segment of market players cautious. According to Srikanth Subramanian, CEO of Kotak Cherry, an integrated investment platform within the Kotak Group, the recent trend of Indian markets defying global weakness and touching all-time highs is due to renewed interest from foreign funds as the country’s decoupling story continues to play out. “However, one must also realise that as we continue to see better growth rates than the world, our valuations too are priced at those premiums. Even long-term investors at this point should not betray discipline,” Subramanian said.There are analysts who warn that with most Indian stocks looking fully priced and China in the middle of a selloff, 2023 could see several global investors shifting funds from India to China. In such a situation, the domestic market could see sharp corrections next year.On the other side of the spectrum, however, are analysts and strategists who feel that the current bull rally could continue for several months. A report by Morgan Stanley said that its analysts feel there was a 30% chance the sensex would touch the 80,000-point mark by December 2023. From the current market close, that’s a 28% gain in a little more than a year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-closes-at-record-high-for-3rd-day-in-a-row/articleshow/95842277.cms,0

The sensex has gained in all of the last seven sessions during which it has recorded fresh life highs in five consecutive sessions.On Wednesday, the sensex opened flat and remained in a very narrow range till the closing hour when a strong bout of buying lifted it above 63,000 to an all-time high of 63,303 before settling at 63,100, also a record peak on a closing basis. The gains came on the back of a strong buying by foreign funds, which believe India is emerging to be one of the outliers among the major global markets, most of which are witnessing strong selling.The recent rally has also lifted investors’ wealth to a new peak near Rs 300 lakh crore, with BSE’s market cap now at Rs 291.7 lakh crore, official data showed.Data from CDSL and the BSE showed that November was the second-best month for net buying of stocks by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), with the net inflow figure at a little over Rs 45,000 crore. In August, foreign funds had net bought stocks worth Rs 51,204 crore. However, since FPIs net sold stocks in eight of the 11 months this year, the annual figure is deep in the red at a negative Rs 1.32 lakh crore.According to Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research (retail), Kotak Securities, during Wednesday’s session, investor sentiment turned extremely bullish towards the closing stages as renewed buying by FPIs propelled leading benchmark indices to scale fresh highs. “Also, strong European markets’ opening further bolstered investor sentiment ahead of (India’s GDP data for the July-September quarter) announcement. India is currently seen as a green shoot in an otherwise weak global economic scenario because of its strong macroeconomic performance in recent months.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-hits-63k-for-first-time-investor-wealth-nears-300l-cr/articleshow/95899740.cms,0

Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have led to an emergence of rare trade routes for Russian crude and refined products that were mainly sold to European countries. India imported about 410,000 tonnes of naphtha, used for making petrochemicals, in Sept-Oct, the Refinitiv data showed. Of this figure, Reliance received about 150,000 tonnes from the Russian ports of Ust-Luga, Tuapse and Novorossiysk during the two months, the data showed. The private refiner did not buy Russian naphtha in 2020 and 2021. Its annual imports of Russian naphtha were restricted to just one parcel in four years to 2019, the data showed. The data showed a panamax carrier Okyroe sailing towards India laden with about 59,000 tonnes of Russian naphtha. ""With European countries shutting down Russia, they need to find outlets for their naphtha,"" a trader based in India said, referring to Russian firms. Russian naphtha is being sold at lower premiums to countries like India, two Asian naphtha traders said. Reliance, its two plants together capable of processing 1.4 million barrels of oil a day, has emerged as a key buyer of Russian oil since Moscow's February military action in Ukraine. It also buys straight run fuel oil from countries, including Iraq and Russia, to process at cokers in the two refineries in the western Indian state of Gujarat to boost refining margins. Reliance's fuel oil imports from Russia have surged to a record 3 million tonnes since the beginning of this fiscal year in April, versus about 1.6 million for all of 2021/22, Refinitiv data shows. Reliance is expected to receive about 409,000 tonnes of fuel oil in December, the data showed. Reliance did not respond to Reuters emails seeking comments.

Moreover, the civic body is also likely to approve further digging for laying over 350km long cable in coming days.Though digging for Jio works is damaging power cables, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd has not taken any action.Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited similar to JDFPL, was given permission to lay 423km long fibre optical cable in 2014, leading to huge controversies after death of a toddler in a pit, damage to public services utilities, poor restoration, financial loss to cash-strapped civic body and no internet to the NMC offices etc.Taking cognizance of TOI reports on how the company failed to restore tar as well as cement roads after laying cables, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B had withheld further permission for laying over 400km long cable. The civic chief had directed the company to first ensure restoration of earlier trenches.A visit to a few spots where the cables were laid revealed that the company is yet to do the restoration.Despite this, the NMC has given permission to lay 50.21km long cable at 120 locations, of which 29 spots are on cement roads and remaining on tar roads. Sources said the permission has been given with a condition to lay cable using horizontal directional drilling (HDD) technique.Earlier also, the company had laid cables after trenching roads though the permission was granted for using HDD technology. Yet, NMC had neither taken any action, nor ensured proper restoration of roads.Now that the company has started cable laying work, it has dug up four spots by removing inter-locking tiles on Khamla Road, which was concretized a year ago. At one place, underground power cable supplying electricity to shops in the area was damaged. Power supply to a hardware shop was disconnected for a day. The owner had to buy new cable to get power supply on temporary basis. After several requests, the company officials restored the power supply.Though power cable was damaged, engineers of MSEDCL did nothing. An engineer from MSEDCL Khamla substation told TOI, “The cable belonged to private shop and hence we are not concerned. The shop owner should get the restoration work done from the company.”A senior officer from the discom’s Trimurti Nagar subdivision said, “Power cable up to the meter of consumer belongs to MSEDCL. We will check and initiate action if the cable was damaged by the company.” The company spokesperson said, “Power supply to the shop has been restored.”Sources in the NMC said permission to lay over 350km long cable across the city will be given soon. “This time, the company will be allowed to dig and lay cables on internal roads,” sources said.

Stating that many Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies are keen on starting operations in Maharashtra and they have also received several proposals from these companies, the minister said a big BPO industry will be allotted land in Nashik. “The IT park could not take shape in Nashik due to lack of the IT policy as the previous policy expired around two years ago. But we are preparing a new IT policy that will boost the growth of the IT section in Maharashtra,” he said.Adding that the state recently introduced the electric vehicle policy, the minister said the state government is also planning to prepare a hydrogen policy and it will be introduced shortly. He said, “We must take an effort to get large industrial projects, but we also need to boost the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Hence, the industry department is in the process of setting up a separate committee of experts that will work on the measures to be taken to boost the MSMEs in the state.” Samant said both Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and MIDC should sort out the industrial issues together.

As a working couple, the duo share household responsibilities but she has been disappointed that she has to clean up after her husband who does his bit looking into his smartphone. Smartphones were meant to bring humans closer but are now creating rifts. Marriage counsellors and psychologists TOI spoke to said that almost 75% of the referrals they get these days involve spousal relationships with various issues but smartphone/digital addiction is at the crux of many of them .Further, a survey on Monday by smartphone maker Vivo noted that 88% of respondents said that increased usage of smartphones is hurting their relationship with their spouses, and 67% confess to being engrossed on their phones when spending time with their spouse.With increasing reliance on smartphones to get one's daily jobs done and the proliferation of social media, there is an increase in the hours spent on the device, and this is affecting dynamics of all relationships. Social media is now the primal form of social interaction between people and in-person engagements have taken a backseat.“While some couples acknowledge that the device is creating discord, many go into a defence mechanism mode and say they turn to the smartphone because of certain flaws with their partners,” Saras Bhaskar, a counseling psychologist based in Chennai, says. Bhaskar says that in almost five out of seven referrals today, smartphone use plays a key role in causing trust deficit and insecurities.The respondents to Vivo's survey say they spend an average 4.7 hours per day on their smartphones with women spending marginally more time on the device than men. A large majority of 90% say that immersing themselves into their phones is the most preferred avenue for them for relaxation. In such times, 70% of people get irritated when their spouse asks for something.“It used to be television, work, friends and other distractions. In recent times, phones and tablets have made it easier for partners to numb their minds from the stresses of day-to-day life and the issues in their relationship,"" Dr. Vijay Nagaswami, a psychiatrist and family counsellor, said. ""I would attribute this to the general decrease in attention spans and the need for quick-fixes which make it difficult to engage in the “work” of a relationship or working through an issue,” he added.However, in a silver lining, 68% of partners confess to feeling guilty at times for being distracted by their phone while spending time with their spouse, and 84% of respondents said they wish to spend more quality time with their spouse.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/smartphone-use-creating-marital-discord-survey/articleshow/96212898.cms,1

The order clears the decks for the sessions court to frame charges and begin the trial in the case.Challenging the JJB order of October 17, the accused’s father, who is the petitioner, argued that it failed to consider the social investigation report, violated the principle of presumption of innocence, put undue reliance on prosecution’s case, and failed to consider the statements of students, teachers and neighbours in favour of the accused.In his 45-page order, additional sessions judge Tarun Singal said the court found no merit in the appeal filed against the JJB order. “The court finds no infirmity or illegality in the order of October 17 passed by JJB. The detailed discussion reveals that the same has been passed within the parameters suggested by apex court in (its) judgment dated July 13 and suffers from no impropriety or illegality. Thus, the appeal lacks merits and is dismissed,” the judge said in the order.“After hearing the parties, taking into consideration detailed forensic report, neuro psychological reports, opinion of medical board from Institute of Mental Health of PGIMS Rohtak who carried out clinical assessment of the juvenile and after personally interacting with the juvenile, JJB passed an order on October 17 holding that there was need of trial of juvenile as adult and sent the matter to sessions court,” the order went on to observe. Defence counsel Vishal Gupta argued in court the JJB’s conclusion about the accused having sufficient mental and physical capacity to understand the consequences of the crime was based on conjecture and surmises. “JJB selectively relied on the medical report, without reading the same in totality. It picked up portions from the report without actually referring to or considering the scientific conclusions,” Gupta told the court.“JJB on one hand, records that the juvenile had not faced any abuse or trauma at home, and his family environment was good and healthy. However, it fails to consider that the entire case of the prosecution is based on the alleged offence being committed by the juvenile just to postpone parent-teachers’ meeting,” Gupta argued. Dismissing the arguments, the judge observed that the JJB had made every possible effort to retrospectively determine the mental and physical capacity of the juvenile. “There is no violation of the principle of natural justice and fair play as adequate opportunity is already granted to parties,” the judge said in his order. “The facts on record suggest the juvenile was well aware of the consequences of the alleged offence, and he tried to conceal the same or allegedly tried to mislead police so as to avoid his apprehension,” he added.On the defence’s contention about over-reliance on the CBI chargesheet, the judge noted that only statements of witnesses recorded by the prosecution had been taken into consideration, in line with Juvenile Justice rules.During arguments, the defence also questioned the conduct of DSP Ajay Kumar Bassi, CBI’s investigating officer in the case. “Bassi is manipulative and left no stone unturned to falsely implicate the juvenile in the present case. His conduct should be considered before reaching any conclusion,” the counsel argued.This was rejected by the court as “irrelevant”. “The conduct of DSP Ajay Kumar Bassi cannot be discussed at this stage of the case. His conduct is irrelevant for the purpose of conducting preliminary assessment of the juvenile,” the judge observed.The JJB’s October 17 ruling was the second time it ordered the accused’s trial as an adult. The first one was struck down by the Supreme Court for procedural lapses. The accused, who was apprehended in November 2017, got bail from the Supreme Court on October 20. He was 16 years and 5 months old at the time of the crime.

A clear improvement in corporate and bank balance sheets, which were under strain prior to the pandemic, is likely to facilitate a steady acceleration in investment in the coming years.Nevertheless, risks remain given dynamics in labour force participation, the lagging rural sector recovery, and uneven reform implementation record, Fitch added.""Fitch Ratings has affirmed India's Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-' with a Stable Outlook,"" the rating agency said in a statement.'BBB-' is the lowest investment grade rating.India enjoyed 'BBB-' rating since an upgrade in August 2006 but the outlook has oscillated between stable and negative. In June this year, Fitch had upped India's rating outlook to 'stable' from 'negative'.Fitch has forecast GDP growth of 7 per cent in the fiscal year ending March 2023 (FY23) on the back of sustained consumption and investment recoveries.""India is somewhat insulated from the gloomy global outlook in 2023, given its modest reliance on external demand. Nevertheless, we expect declining exports, heightened uncertainty and higher interest rates to slow growth to 6.2 per cent in FY24,"" it said.Fitch added that India's rating reflects strengths from a robust growth outlook compared to peers and still-resilient external finances, which have supported the country in navigating the large external shocks during the past year.These are offset by India's weak public finances, illustrated by high deficits and debt relative to peers, as well as lagging structural indicators, including World Bank governance indicators and GDP per capita, it added.Fitch estimates India's debt to GDP ratio to come down to 82.1 per cent this fiscal, from 87.6 per cent in 2020-21.Fitch forecast the current account deficit (CAD) to rise to 3.3 per cent of GDP this fiscal, from 1.2 per cent in the previous year, due to a rising import bill from high commodity prices and robust domestic demand, and declining exports.

The research group ,"Varanasi: Researchers of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) have come up with a key finding in heritable priming in crop plants by Trichoderma. The research group led by Prashant Singh of department of Botany has identified Trichoderma as a priming agent.The team of researchers claimed that it has, for the first time, reported heritable priming in crop plants like wheat by Trichoderma. The work has been published in one of the high-impact journals, Frontiers in Plant Science. The group included students Menka Tiwari (PhD) and Rajat Singh (Masters).Singh informed that plant defence priming is an intentional, regulated and on-demand defensive strategy because the plant is deliberately subjected to a small dose of stress that triggers the defence response only when the plant is attacked by a pathogen. This helps prevent wasteful metabolic consumption in plants.The concept of ‘defence priming’ is remarkably similar to how vaccines for human diseases are developed. A vaccination works by mimicking a pathogen. It deceives the immune system into believing that it is under attack, triggering defence responses such as antibody production. This establishes a defensive memory, allowing the immune system to recall a specific pathogen, if the body is exposed to it again, and the vaccine’s primed memory can then respond quickly and effectively.Singh called it a ‘green vaccination’. He said that crop plants encounter a variety of biotic challenges in the field, which at times adversely impact crop yield. In the current scenario of an ever-increasing global population, there is an urgent need to protect plant health by using a sustainable approach to maximise crop productivity and meet food demands.With increasing reliance on chemical crop protection techniques, a number of environmental and health difficulties have become inevitable. Priming could be a beneficial strategy in a scenario, when there is a huge impact on environment and plant health. This is a strategy for smart plant health care for human welfare.He said the research group used Trichoderma for the first time as a priming agent in the wheat variety HUW510 and reported that primed HUW510 seeds were more protected against spot-blotch disease, caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana. Once induced, priming was maintained throughout the life of wheat plants and passed on to the next generation. The group has named it ‘intergenerational immune priming’ (IGIP).Singh further said the findings will provide a niche for sustainable food security because an efficient induction of IGIP would allow poor farmers to collect their own seed stocks of more resistant varieties, thereby making their food production less vulnerable to outbreaks of pests and disease.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/trichoderma-a-priming-agent-in-crop-plants-bhu-researchers/articleshow/96358819.cms,2

The tw","MUMBAI: Gujarat’s Torrent Group has emerged as the highest bidder in the challenger round for Reliance Capital under the bankruptcy process. Torrent Group and the Hindujas bid over Rs 8,000 crore each, significantly improving their earlier offers.While the two bids are well over the revised base price of Rs 6,500 crore set by the committee of creditors, selling to the highest bidder may be a difficult decision for the lenders. This is because the CoC is understood to have set a liquidation price of around Rs 13,000 crore.

The challenger round has thrown up a surprise as both Torrent Group and the Hindujas had been restrained in their earlier bid, where they offered Rs 4,500 crore and Rs 5,060 crore, respectively. The Torrent Group has its mainstay in the pharma business with manufacturing plants across India. The company is also in power generation, transmission and distribution, and its other businesses include cable manufacturing and gas supply. Torrent, which was founded by Uttambhai Mehta in 1959, is led by his two sons Sudhir and Samir Mehta. The group had acquired Gujarat Lease Finance, marking its foray in the financial services segment. The Hindujas, who own IndusInd Bank, have looked at floating an insurance company. According to creditors, the maximum value of Reliance Capital resides in its two insurance ventures, Reliance Nippon Life Insurance and Reliance General Insurance.

Metro Cash & Carry India is the local arm of German wholesaler Metro.The deal with RIL will mark Metro’s exit from the world’s fifth largest economy. Metro entered India in 2003 and was the first company to introduce cash-and-carry business format in the country. It currently operates 31 large format stores across 21 Indian cities with about 3,500 employees. RIL has routed the transaction through its subsidiary Reliance Retail Ventures.The acquisition will give Reliance Retail access to Metro India’s stores located in prime spots, its large base of registered kiranas and other institutional customers and its strong supplier network. Metro has a reach of over three million institutional customers, of which one million are frequent buyers. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, Metro India generated sales of Rs 7,700 crore, its best sales performance since its entry into the country.The acquisition will further strengthen Reliance Retail’s physical store footprint and ability to better serve consumers and small merchants by leveraging synergies and efficiencies across supply chain networks, technology platforms and sourcing capabilities. Reliance Retail operates more than 16,500 stores in India and partners with over two million merchants across grocery, electronics, apparel, pharmacy, lingerie, home and furnishing, beauty and personal care.“With Metro India, we are selling a growing and profitable wholesale business in a very dynamic market at the right time. We are convinced that in Reliance we have found a suitable partner who is willing and able to successfully lead the company into the future in this market environment,” said Metro AG CEO Steffen Greubel. “This in one hand will benefit both our customers and our employees, for whose loyalty and performance we are very grateful, and on the other hand will enable Metro to focus on accelerating growth in the remaining country portfolio.” The transaction, subject to regulatory and other customary closing conditions, is expected to be concluded by March 2023.

Heightened local competition, shifting global market priorities, new business models, accumulated losses, among other factors are some of the reasons why some MNCs pulled out from India.German wholesaler Metro, which had entered India 19 years ago with big hopes, and is now selling its local business to Reliance Industries, said: ""The Indian market has been undergoing an intensive transformation for several years, characterised by consolidation in trade and increasing digitalisation in wholesale as well. In order to keep pace with this dynamic development and to further drive the company's growth, significant investments would be necessary.""96439275""We have chosen an alternative that opens a new chapter for Metro India. Metro is divesting Metro India to a strong partner who will be able to give the Indian business long-term economic and technological prospects,"" said its global CEO Steffen Greubel in a communique to employees.Eight years ago, France's Carrefour closed down its wholesale outlets in India. The B2B segment (cash and carry) is a low-margin business and that's a key reason why even other MNCs like Carrefour have exited from India, said analysts.""Retail in India is increasingly getting consolidated in favour of much larger players like Reliance,"" said Abneesh Roy of Nuvama Group. He added that kiranas, too, are facing tough competition and losing share to quick commerce, e-commerce and modern trade players. The dynamics in India's various sectors are changing with homegrown players having a dominant presence and MNCs' having a reduced play. For example: the consumer mobile services business and cement industry. After Swiss major Holcim sold its India cement units to Adani, the top players in the sector are domestic companies. J Sagar Associates partner Lalit Kumar said: ""The exit of large MNCs is part of their business and commercial reasons and not regulatory and legal requirements in India."" Holcim had said that its India exit was to focus on green business. According to industry experts, some reasons behind decisions taken by a few MNCs to exit India, include the business model not aligning with the parent's globally; poor margins; and, to top it, the brick-and-mortar business got deeply disrupted by online channels in a big way.""Carrefour, Walmart and now Metro have exited India for different reasons, but it's a fact that countries like India are outliers. While Walmart suddenly went in for a pregnant pause in expansions, and that led to a bit of stagnation, Carrefour wanted to be a pure retailer but it began in cash-and-carry, which did not fit in with the global plan and, therefore, it didn't work out for them either. So their models in India did not conform with the global model, and that's a key reason why some MNCs have exited,"" said an industry expert.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-some-mncs-are-pulling-out-of-india/articleshow/96435738.cms,1

While the elder brother took over as the chairman and managing director, Anil was named vice chairman and joint managing director.The brothers, however, feuded over control, leading to a split with Mukesh assuming control of the gas, oil, and petrochemicals units as RIL, while Anil got telecommunications, power generation, and financial services units through a demerger.In 20 years that Stanford University-drop out Mukesh, 65, has been at the helm of RIL, the company has re-entered the telecom business, diversified in retail and new energy, and raised a record Rs 2.5 lakh crore selling minority interests during the Covid lockdown.Here is his journey in numbers at the helm of RIL:* Market capitalization grew at an annualized rate of 20.6 per cent in the last 20 years from Rs 41,989 crore in March 2002, to Rs 17,81,841 crore in March 2022.* Revenues grew at an annualized rate of 15.4 per cent from Rs 45,411 crore in FY 2001-02, to Rs 792,756 crore in FY 2021-22.* Net profit grew at an annualized rate of 16.3 per cent from Rs 3,280 crore in FY 2001-02, to Rs 67,845 crore in FY 2021-22.* Exports grew at an annualized rate of 16.9 per cent from Rs 11,200 crore in FY 2001-02, to Rs 254,970 crore in FY 2021-22.* Total assets grew at an annualized rate of 18.7 per cent from Rs 48,987 crore in March 2002, to Rs 14,99,665 crore in March 2022.* Net worth grew at an annualized rate of 17 per cent from Rs 27,977 crore in March 2002, to Rs 645,127 crore in March 2022.* RIL added Rs 17.4 lakh crore to investor wealth during these two decades, which is an average of Rs 87,000 crore every year.According to Motilal Oswal's 26th annual wealth creation study, the company has emerged as the largest wealth creator, over 2016-21, creating wealth to the tune of nearly Rs 10 lakh crore and breaking its own previous record.DiversificationReliance started several new businesses in these two decades - telecom arm Jio started operations in 2016, retail in 2006, and new energy in 2021.From a single oil refinery in 2002, Jamnagar is now the world's largest single-location refining complex. During this period, RIL doubled oil refining capacity, adding the unique capability to convert the worst of crude oils into the best of exportable fuels. It also added some of the world's largest downstream units.Its traditional business of petrochemicals too flourished and expanded many-fold in the last two decades.Reliance's oil and gas exploration (E&P) business made the first hydrocarbon discovery in late 2002 and production started in 2009. The firm got UK's bp plc as an investor in the E&P business in 2011 and in recent months, it brought to production the second set of discoveries.RIL brought bp, one of the global petroleum industry leaders, as a partner in its Indian fuel retailing business. Reliance Mobility Solutions has brought the latest technology and offerings for consumers at petro-retail outlets through the Jio-bp brand. It aims to offer a new experience in buying fuel with high-quality service and making the retail outlets future-ready with charging and battery swap facilities.Reliance set the foundation for New Energy Business committing over Rs 75,000 crore investment in three years to set up five uniquely integrated Giga Factories at Jamnagar with the world's latest technology. This will have a first-of-its-kind 'quartz-to-module' solar panel facility. The ultimate aim is to emerge world's lowest-cost producer of solar energy and green hydrogen.Reliance has set a target to become Net Carbon Neutral by 2035, contributing to India's net carbon zero mission. It will start 10GW of solar PV cell and module factory by 2024, to be scaled up to 20GW by 2026. By 2025, RIL plans to generate its entire round-the-clock (RTC) power and intermittent energy for Green Hydrogen from captive solar power plants.FundraisingReliance set a record for capital fundraising in FY21. It raised more than Rs 2.5 lakh crore through a rights issue and minority stake sales in Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail Ventures to global marquee investors such as Facebook and Google. During FY2021, Reliance was the single-largest foreign direct investment (FDI) generator for India.After the launch of Jio, India became the data capital of the world and the cost of data/GB fell from Rs 500 to Rs 12. India's ranking in Broadband data consumption moved from 150 in 2016 to No.1 in 2018 thanks to Jio.Born in Aden, Yemen, where his father worked as a gas station attendant, Mukesh Ambani earned his bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Bombay (now the University of Mumbai) and subsequently pursued a master's degree in business administration from Stanford University.He, however, left the program in 1981 to join the family business, where he worked to diversify the company, foraying into communications, infrastructure, petrochemicals, petroleum refining, polyester fibres, and oil and gas production.In 2007, he became India's first rupee trillionaire. He, however, has lost the richest Indian tag to a fellow Gujarati businessman, Gautam Adani in recent months.Reliance Foundation, backed by Reliance Industries, came up in 2010 to spearhead the company's philanthropic initiatives under the leadership of his wife Nita. It works in the areas of rural empowerment, nutrition security, ecological conservation, education, and sports.Reliance Foundation is India's biggest corporate social responsibility initiative by reach, as well as by spend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/journey-in-numbers-mukesh-ambani-completes-20-years-at-helm-of-reliance/articleshow/96576241.cms,0

Criminals are out to steal your money and sensitive data by luring you with the promise of upgrading to 5G. Several Vodafone users have been receiving messages on text (SMS) and WhatsApp asking them to upgrade to 5G by clicking on a link or by calling on a certain number. Some Vodafone users in Times of India Tech edit team too have been getting such text messages claiming to be from Vodafone-Idea. ""Vi 5G network is live. Click on the link below or call on XXXXXX number to upgrade,' reads one such message. The link in one of the messages is of some Paytm account. There are several versions of such fraud messages circulating – all with the aim to dupe Vodafone users in the name of 5G upgrade. 96561493 What makes these messages dangerousVodafone users need to note that the company is yet to announce its 5G plans. While Airtel and Reliance Jio have launched 5G services in certain cities across the country, Vodafone is yet to start 5G rollout in the country. This means that all messages/calls that claim to offer Vodafone users 5G upgrade are fraud. By clicking on these links users will become victims of financial or data fraud. They may also end up giving hackers remote control of their device. So, it is critical not to respond to any such message or call that promises 5G upgrade. 96356896 96451607 Also, not just Vodafone-Idea, customers of no telecom service providers, including Airtel and Jio (who have rolled out 5G services), can upgrade to 5G by just clicking on a link. Please also note here that 5G services from Airtel and Jio too are available only in select cities of the country right now. What Vodafone says on 5G rollout""Vi is actively working with its partners to bring 5G to multiple cities. Wait to hear from us on our plans,"" is what Vodafone-Idea says on its page about rollout of 5G services in India. It further informs users that they will not require new SIM cards to avail 5G services. ""No, you only need to have a 4G compatible SIM card to experience 5G."" All that users will require is a 5G compatible phone and need to be in an area where 5G services are available. So, Vodafone-Idea users wait for information through official channels rather than trusting any call or SMS about 5G upgrade.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLHMn17hgW4",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/vodafone-users-heres-a-5g-warning-for-you-that-airtel-and-jio-users-too-need-to-note/articleshow/96558072.cms,2

It should provide more jobs and incomes to its network partners such as farmers, traders and SMEs, Ambani said. He congratulated Isha for the retail unit’s growth. The business has created more than two lakh new jobs last year, becoming one of India’s leading employers.Jio and retail accounted for half (50%) of RIL’s operating profit in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Ambani, 65, said the goals before RIL’s third and newest startup business, new energy, are “crystal clear”. With Anant, the youngest son, joining this next-gen business, “we are making rapid progress in getting our giga factories in Jamnagar (home to RIL’s petroleum refining complex) ready”, the chairman of India’s largest company in terms of market value said. “From being India’s largest and most valuable corporate, Reliance is now well on its way to also becoming India’s ‘greenest’ corporate.” Ambani had announced plans to invest $75 billion in green energy infrastructure including solar panels and electrolyzers. “The next major growth cycle in Reliance will not be resource driven, but innovation driven.” Ambani said winning in business takes both leadership and teamwork and went on to cite the example of Argentina winning the World Cup football. “But how did Argentina win the Cup? It is because of the combination of leadership and teamwork. Messi could not have won the Cup on his own. Similarly, the Argentinian team could not have won without Messi’s inspiring leadership. They faltered in the first game, but they did not give up. Ultimately, they won because they were breathing victory, dreaming of victory, and doing everything needed to achieve victory... until the last penalty shot,” he said. And this is how founder Dhirubhai Ambani also built Reliance, he said.Ambani spoke about the succession plan at RIL for the first time at the December 2021 Reliance event. At the internal event, he had said the company is effecting a “momentum leadership transition” which will see him and other seniors making way for the next generation. While all his three children are on boards of the telecom, retail and new energy arms, none are, however, on the main company RIL’s board.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ril-to-be-indias-greenest-corporate-ambani/articleshow/96609918.cms,2

And the focus is on those delivering batch orders in the quick-commerce grocery segment. “If someone makes ten deliveries and they get five stars on all deliveries, they will get more than what they would otherwise make,” Biswas told TOI. 96724580 Asked if this would lead to an obsession with ratings, Biswas said a decision on regulating this will be taken based on customer feedback. The company, which began as a venture providing last mile couriering service, doing pickups of all kinds of products, today has a huge focus on the grocery delivery segment. Biswas said a major part of the products in its warehouse comes from JioMart, for which it also does last mile delivery. Reliance Retail had invested $200 million in Dunzo last year for a 25.8% stake.Dunzo is trying to get its delivery executives to take up more orders from the company’s warehouses than retail stores. Biswas said the protests were largely because of this change -- pickups from warehouses, which are few in number compared to retail stores, meant the delivery executives needed to spend more time on picking and delivering orders. Dunzo's quick commerce is not as quick as that of platforms like Zepto, and the company wants to keep it like that because it believes faster deliveries will be too prohibitive in terms of costs. “Most of our customers are happy if we can deliver within 22 minutes. 40% of our orders want slow delivery.

If the devices that do that, electrolysers, a","NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet has approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission to promote green hydrogen in a bid to cut emissions and become a major exporter in the field. The move is aimed at making India the global hub for the production of green hydrogen and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.What is green hydrogen? How does it differ from traditional emissions-intensive ‘grey’ hydrogen and blue hydrogen?According to Dr Emanuele Taibi, Head of the Power Sector Transformation Strategies, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Hydrogen is the simplest and smallest element in the periodic table. No matter how it is produced, it ends up with the same carbon-free molecule. However, the pathways to produce it are very diverse, and so are the emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).Hydrogen, made by splitting water with an electrical process called electrolysis, can be used as a fuel. If the devices that do that, electrolysers, are powered by renewable energy, the product is called green hydrogen.""Grey hydrogen is traditionally produced from methane (CH4), split with steam into CO2 – the main culprit for climate change – and H2, hydrogen. Grey hydrogen has increasingly been produced also from coal, with significantly higher CO2 emissions per unit of hydrogen produced, so much that is often called brown or black hydrogen instead of grey,"" said Taibi.Blue hydrogen follows the same process as grey, said Taibi with the additional technologies necessary to capture the CO2 produced when hydrogen is split from methane (or from coal) and store it for long term. It is not one colour but rather a very broad gradation, as not 100% of the CO2 produced can be captured, and not all means of storing it are equally effective in the long term. 96756054So, unlike grey hydrogen which uses natural gas, green hydrogen is produced by the electrolysis of water using renewable energy and thus doesn't emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The carbon intensity ultimately depends on the carbon neutrality of the source of electricity (i.e., the more renewable energy there is in the electricity fuel mix, the “greener” the hydrogen produced.Green hydrogen can cut dependency on fossil fuels, as the global market for the clean alternative is slated to be worth almost $60 billion.What is the free hydrogen mission in India?The National Hydrogen Mission was launched on August 15, 2021, with a view to cutting down carbon emissions and increasing the use of renewable sources of energy. The mission seeks to promote the development of green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 MMT (Million Metric Tonnes) per annum with an associated renewable energy capacity addition of about 125 GW in the country by 2030.What is the latest development?In what could be a big step towards achieving India’s updated climate action goals, the government on Wednesday approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission with initial financial outlay of Rs 19,744 crore. It will help India in not only reducing its carbon footprint but also saving a substantial amount of foreign exchange on import of fossil fuels in due course.The mission will eventually help the country become energy independent while taking a big leap towards decarbonisation of major sectors of the economy as part of its long-term goal of carbon neutrality by 2070.It is expected that the mission would help India in abating nearly 50 million metric tonnes of annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emission by 2030 in sync with India’s updated climate action pledge under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions intensity (emission per unit of its GDP) by 45% by 2030 from 2005 level.The ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) will formulate the guidelines for implementation of the different components of the Mission.The components of the mission include an outlay of Rs 17,490 crore for the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition Programme (SIGHT), Rs 1,466 crore for pilot projects, Rs 400 crore for R&D, and Rs 388 crore towards other related initiatives. The allocation is expected to attract huge investments and encourage R&D, focussed on electrolysers, in the next few years.In all, the mission envisages an investment of over Rs 8 lakh crore and creation of over 6 lakh jobs by 2030.It will also result in a cumulative reduction in fossil fuel imports of over Rs 1 lakh crore and abatement of nearly 50 MMT of annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.The mission will have wide-ranging benefits — creation of export opportunities for green hydrogen and its derivatives; decarbonisation of industrial, mobility and energy sectors; reduction in dependence on imported fossil fuels and feedstock; development of indigenous manufacturing capabilities; creation of employment opportunities; and development of cutting-edge technologies.The mission will also support pilot projects in emerging end-use sectors and production pathways. Regions capable of supporting large-scale production and/or utilisation of hydrogen will be identified and developed as Green Hydrogen Hubs, the Minister added.Further, a public-private partnership framework for R&D (Strategic Hydrogen Innovation Partnership - SHIP) will be facilitated under the mission. R&D projects will be goal-oriented, time-bound, and suitably scaled up to develop globally competitive technologies. A coordinated skill development programme will also be undertaken.Green Hydrogen Production in India: How competitive can it be?According to Niti Ayogya, green hydrogen prices are determined largely by the cost of electrolysers and electricity. Beyond that, there are the operating costs, transmission and distribution (T&D) costs, and wheeling charges for electricity as well as specific local duties and taxes like the goods and services tax (GST) in India.""The cost of hydrogen from electrolysis today is relatively high, between around $7/kg and $4.10/kg depending on various technology choices and the associated soft costs. This makes it hard to compete with the existing cost of grey or brown hydrogen. But India has some of the most competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar and wind in the world while remaining a net importer of natural gas. Given the promises of electrolyser cost and LCOE decline, it is more beneficial to expand green hydrogen production in India rather than production of grey or blue hydrogen,"" the Niti Ayogya paper on Harnessing Green Hydrogen said.India’s distinct advantage in terms of low-cost renewable electricity, complemented by rapidly falling electrolyser prices, can enable green hydrogen to be not just economical compared to fossil-fuel based hydrogen but also compared to the green hydrogen being produced around the globe. Adoption of green hydrogen can enable India to abate 3.6 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions cumulatively between now and 2050.""Now, India has the advantage of low cost. The cost of green hydrogen in the country is expected to fall to about one-fourth of global levels. At about US$1 per kg, India could become the lowest-cost producer in the world...but a shift to green hydrogen as a new renewable source won't happen in a hurry, as energy transitions, in general, take a long time,"" said Tanushree Banerjee Editor, StockSelect Equitymaster Agora Research Private Limited.According to the report, India can target the following areas to make a successful transition to green hydrogen• Both near-term and long-term policy pathways to reduce the cost of green hydrogen need to be encouraged to enable cost competitiveness against alternatives.• A cost-competitive green hydrogen is bound to lead to market creation. But the government can also encourage near-term market development by identifying industrial clusters and enacting associated viability gap funding and mandates.• An emerging green hydrogen economy means opportunities around research and development and manufacturing of components such as electrolysers and fuel cells, crucial to enabling the industry to develop and scale.• A globally competitive green hydrogen industry also leads to prospects of exports of green hydrogen and hydrogen- embedded low-carbon products such as green ammonia and green steel.The importance of green hydrogen Green hydrogen can achieve cost parity with natural gas-based hydrogen (grey hydrogen) by 2030, if not before. Beyond cost, since hydrogen is only as clean as its source of generation, green hydrogen will be necessary to achieve a truly low-carbon economy. It will also enable the emergence of a domestically produced energy carrier that can reduce the dependence on imports for key commodities like natural gas and petroleum.What are the major sops being provided by the government for green hydrogen?  India plans to build electrolyser capacity of 60-100 gigawatts to help produce green hydrogen.The incentive by the government aims to make green hydrogen affordable and bring down its production cost, currently at Rs 300 to Rs 400 per kg.Grey hydrogen costs around Rs 200 per kg to produce as gas costs have pushed the prices from Rs 130 per kg. To promote the use of green hydrogen, mandatory targets for green hydrogen consumption — would be required of fertiliser units, petroleum refineries and city gas distribution networks.The government has allowed concessional green electricity, waiver of inter-state transmission charges, land at renewable energy parks and mega manufacturing zones for promoting green hydrogen and green ammonia. India also plans to introduce a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to encourage the manufacturing of electrolyzers. The plan is to target lower costs of renewable power generation and to bring down the costs of electrolysers to make the production of green hydrogen cost-competitive so that this fuel could replace fossil fuels and fossil fuel-based feedstocks in fertiliser production, petroleum refining, steel production, and transport applications.Which companies stand to gain? Reliance Industries, Indian Oil, NTPC, Adani Enterprises, JSW Energy and Acme Solar have big plans on green hydrogen. Reliance Industries aims to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen to under $1/kg by the end of this decade while billionaire Gautam Adani has stated that Adani Group aspires to be among the biggest producers of green hydrogen in the world.State-owned NTPC on January 3, said it has commissioned India's first green hydrogen blending project. The green hydrogen blending has been started in the piped natural gas (PNG) network of NTPC Kawas township, Surat. The project is a joint effort of NTPC and Gujarat Gas Ltd (GGL).Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is targeting to replace at least a tenth of its current fossil-fuel-based hydrogen at its refineries with carbon-free green hydrogen as part of a decarbonization drive. It has set up green hydrogen plants at its Panipat and Mathura refineries. While renewable energy plants currently produce electricity equivalent to 5 per cent of its electricity consumption, IOC is targeting nearly 5 GW of renewable electricity generation capacities by 2025 for use at its oil refineries.Three factors to keep in mind before investing in green hydrogen stocksAccording to Equitymaster's Banerjee, here are three factors you must keep in mind before you decide to load up on green hydrogen stocks.Cost of Electrolyser: Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using an electrolyser. One million tonne of green hydrogen corresponds to around 11-13 GW of electrolyser capacity. According to NITI Aayog, at present, the cost of hydrogen production through electrolysis ranges from US$ 4-10 per kg based on the technology used. With a price decline for both electrolysers and renewables, NITI Aayog expects the cost of green hydrogen to fall to approximately US$2 per kg by 2030 and US$0.7 per kg by 2050.The government recently approved incentives of Rs 170 bn to be allotted for electrolyser and green hydrogen manufacturing in the country. Companies using the incentives for mass scale production could certainly compete on cost.Water availability: For producing 1 kg of hydrogen, 9 kg of water as input is required. Accordingly, a large-scale (1 GW) electrolyser, producing 0.15 million tonne of hydrogen, would consume about 3 million tonne of water. Hence shortage of water can be a key hindrance in green hydrogen manufacturing.Combustibility: Its flammability and its lightness mean that hydrogen, like other fuels, needs to be properly handled. Many fuels are flammable. Compared to gasoline, natural gas, and propane, hydrogen is more flammable in the air. A concern is the higher energy content of hydrogen poses risks as auto fuel. Auto fuels are highly flammable. A vehicle laden with hydrogen will be more vulnerable in case of a major accident. Hydrogen stations will need to adapt to more stringent safety measures. In other words, the technology for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles needs to be far superior in terms of safety. However, the risk of combustibility of hydrogen fuel cells is almost as much as is lithium cells. Hence companies that use technology to mitigate such risks need to be monitored.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explained-what-is-green-hydrogen-and-indias-national-mission-to-cut-emissions-/articleshow/96755832.cms,2

Medicines, boosters and diagnostics — key ammo for fighting Covid — are in the spotlight once again.  96842597Additionally, a focus on quality will dominate the agenda for pharma companies in the wake of recent deaths of children in Gambia and Uzbekistan, potentially due to adulterated cough syrups, industry experts told TOI. The year 2022 had started with the country rolling out booster shots as the Omicron variant became dominant. Pharma companies prepared for the surge, built up huge stocks of key medicines, and launched oral antiviral pills. Thereafter, once the caseload reduced, they got back to boosting non-Covid portfolios and brand-building. “Pandemic planning is back in the spotlight in the wake of concerns around the spread of Covid in certain countries. Also, the China-plus-one strategy has become important with frequent disruptions, geopolitical issues and emphasis on self-reliance,” said Sujay Shetty, global health industries advisory leader at PwC India. Zydus Lifesciences chairman Pankaj Patel told TOI, “Despite supply chain challenges due to the surge in demand of certain drugs multiple times in a short period, the industry was able to ensure consistent supplies. Also, vaccine development and supply for the mass vaccination programme proved India is ‘Atma Nirbhar’.” Regarding the year ahead, Patel said, “In 2023, the industry is confident of tackling healthcare challenges, if the situation occurs again. It is by no means a small achievement that India today is the only country which has therapies approved for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which are unmet healthcare needs. Also, there is work being done on rare and orphan diseases, which have no treatment as of today, globally”Quality and innovation will be a core topic for the industry. Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance’s secretary general Sudarshan Jain summed up the main themes as innovation, quality, expanding global reach to Japan, China & Latin America, and self-reliance. “A focus on quality and in particular USFDA requirements will also dominate the agenda,” Shetty added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/pharma-sector-to-focus-on-supply-chain-covid-mgmt/articleshow/96842234.cms,0

The NCLT had granted interim relief in a petition filed by Torrent Group. Creditors are also seeking from the NCLT an extension of the timeline for resolution of RCap’s default from January 31 to February 15.The committee of creditors (CoC) is likely to meet on January 9 to vote on the proposals. According to bankers, the reason for seeking a fresh round of offers is that bidders are continuing to make changes indicating that there is still scope for value maximisation.The court has admitted claims of Rs 23,666 crore against which the liquidation value is believed to be around Rs 12,500 crore. Bids for the company have increased from Rs 5,231 crore offered by Piramal-Cosmea in the first round, to Rs 9,400 crore offered by the Hindujas after the auction process was over.LIC and provident funds are among the top investors in RCap bonds and among lenders, Yes Bank is the largest investor.Lenders are keen to hold the new auction round with Hinduja’s revised offer as the base price.

The sensex gained 1.4% to close at 60,747 points. The Nifty too gained 1.4%, or 242 points, to close at 18,101.The rally on Wall Street came on the back of a set of economic data that raised expectations that the US Federal Reserve, the country’s central bank, may not raise rates as aggressively as it did in the past few months. This led to a global rally in stocks.As a result, of the 30 sensex constituents, 27 closed with gains. Interestingly foreign funds were strong sellers of Indian stocks with a net outflow worth Rs 203 crore, BSE data showed. Domestic funds, on the other hand, were net buyers at Rs 1,724 crore. The day’s rally also added Rs 3.3 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 285.5 lakh crore.According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, domestic equities saw some support-based buying after witnessing selling pressure last week, largely helped by a rally in global markets. Except stocks from consumer durables space, buying was visible across sectors with IT, metals, PSU banks and auto being top gainers. “Expectation of the US Fed turning less hawkish and opening of remaining Covid-related border controls by both Hong Kong and China uplifted investors’ sentiments.”Technically, the Nifty has to be above 18,000-18,050 zone for the current rally to sustain, Samco Securities technical analyst Rohan Patil wrote in a post-market note. This could take the index towards the 18,250-18,300 zone, whereas support for the Nifty is placed at 17,800, Patil wrote.Going forward, investors will also keep an eye on US, Europe and India’s inflation data, expected during the week, Khemka said. “Further, Fed chair Jerome Powell’s speech on Tuesday will be important for global markets as it could throw some light for future action.”Some other dealers also expect the quarterly earnings numbers by some of the large companies, expected over the next two weeks, would also impact the market’s trend.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-up-847-points-as-global-indices-rally-on-us-eco-data/articleshow/96868982.cms,0

And with the recently approved National Green Hydrogen Mission, India aims to achieve leadership in this field by 2030. Sanjay Dutta explainsWhat is green hydrogen?Hydrogen produced by electrolysing water, using electricity from solar or wind power projects, is designated ‘green’ hydrogen – or increasingly, just GH2.Why is GH2 seen as the ‘fuel of the future’?It is considered the cleanest fuel because its production or consumption does not leave any carbon trail. But it requires large amounts of energy to produce.96896272What do hydrogen’s colour codes signify?The colour codes indicate the source. Grey hydrogen extracted from natural gas is the most common type in use at present. Brown hydrogen is produced through gasification of coal. This process emits greenhouse gases as a byproduct. Blue hydrogen is tapped from greenhouse gases locked up in carbon capture and storage facilities.What are the applications of hydrogen?At present hydrogen use is limited to large industries, such as oil refineries, steel, fertilisers and bulk chemicals. A major application will be for blending with CNG and PNG, to clean up their emissions.When was the GH2 mission launched?PM Narendra Modi first laid out the plan at the third renewable energy investors meet in November 2020. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman articulated the roadmap by announcing the mission in her Budget speech on February 1, 2021. The power ministry on February 17, 2022 notified GH2 and green ammonia policy enablers. Finally, the Cabinet approved an incentive package to seed the market on January 4 this year.What is the Hydrogen Mission’s aim?To strengthen India’s pole position in climate action and energy transition as well as reduce dependence on energy imports. GH2 can potentially lead to savings of Rs 1 lakh crore in India’s energy import bill and cut out 68% of expensive gas shipments by replacing traditional industrial fuel/feedstock. The government sees India meeting 10% of g lobal GH2 demand by 2030.How much does hydrogen cost?Prices of hydrogen vary according to source, market conditions and currency rates. GH2 currently costs Rs 300/kg. The average cost of grey hydrogen extracted from natural gas – the commonly used form of hydrogen – averaged Rs 130/kg but has been Rs 200-250/kg sincethe Ukraine conflict.How much incentive is India offering to develop a GH2 ecosystem?A little over $2 billion. Most of this money will go towards supporting 15GW (gigawatts) of domestic electrolyser manufacturing capacity by 2030. By then the government believes India will have a capacity of 60GW, expected to be the largest in the world. The remaining funds will be used for strategic intervention to help projects.How many other countries are promoting GH2?Official documents indicate 25 countries are chasing the GH2 dream with support from their governments. Germany is offering the highest support at $10. 3 billion, followed by the US with $9 billion, France $8. 2 billion and the European Union $4. 3 billion.Which Indian companies are investing in GH2 projects?State-run IndianOil and GAIL have announced commercial scale GH2 plans. NTPC this week became the first entity to blend PNG with GH2. GAIL and IOC have pilots for blending CNG with grey hydro gen. Oil India Ltd is running hydrogen buses in Kaziranga National Park, Assam. In the private sector, Reliance Industries Ltd, Adani Group and ACME Group have mega-size plans for manufacturing electrolysers, as well as GH2 and green ammonia units.What are the drawbacks of hydrogen?Hydrogen is highly inflammable due to its high energy density and is risky to transport or store. This means either GH2 plants must be set up near consumption sites and green power wheeled from afar, or the gas must be converted into liquid ammonia for transporting. Both options impact the overall project economics.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-indias-push-for-green-hydrogen-could-help-clean-up-the-whole-world/articleshow/96896268.cms,2

With the upcoming commercialisation of Vindhya basin and rich CBM resources, the state is all set to make a mark on the energy map of India. Public health engineering principal secretary Sanjay Kumar Shukla said Madhya Pradesh offers immense opportunities for gas distribution and networking along with growing industrial ecosystem, growing population and urbanisation. Shukla said ONGC well in Damoh, on testing has produced natural gas over 62044 cubic meters/day. This confirms production potential of Proterozoic basin – first time in India.There are huge prospects in setting up CNG bottling station, he said adding opportunities also exist for direct marketing to industries and cluster-based gas prediction through cascade systems.Madhya Pradesh has country’s 9% coal reserves with 7.7 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of prognosticated CBM resource (total 91.8TCF) and 3.64 TCF of established CBM reserves. At present, two CBM blocks – Sohagpur East and West are under production. In special CBM bid round in 2021, two blocks were allotted in Sohagpur and Chhindwara, he said adding “Investment from existing and new blocks is expected to be around Rs 10,000 crore.”He said Madhya Pradesh has a large network of petroleum product pipeline which is helpful in setting-up ancillary industrial activities. “Madhya Pradesh is making continuous efforts for well-planned and smooth exploitation of natural resources available here to ensure India's energy security and energy self-reliance,” the principal secretary said. He spoke about abundant availability of raw material in the state in the ethanol blending sector and the concessions, subsidies and incentives provided to investors and industrial institutions.

It sought a stay on the ‘challenge mechanism’ scheduled for January 19. On Wednesday, the counsel for the administrator and committee of creditors (CoC) stated before the NCLT that the fresh auction for sale would be held on January 23, as hearing of the challenge may not get over before January 19.On Thursday, senior counsel Darius Khambata for Torrent was rejoining to submissions made by a bevy of senior counsel including Kapil Sibal for the CoC, Ravi Kadam, A M Singhvi and Harish Salve who all sought dismissal of the application. Torrent’s other senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi suggested that any fresh auction be deferred by the Tribunal for a week from Monday, to give breathing time to either side to challenge the outcome of its plea, if matter is reserved for orders by Friday.Senior counsel Kapil Sibal for the CoC and Kadam for the administrator interjected and opposed. Sibal said, “Am objecting. The mechanism must go on.’’ The NCLT bench of also said to Rohatgi, “you will be notified when we are ready with the order.’’Salve appearing for Hinduja, another bidder, whose bid was higher than Torrent’s, but also considered to be “sub optimal’’ as it was below the cut off liquidation value, said “If CoC feels in its commercial wisdom that the fresh auction will general more money, it has to be allowed. The Tribunal cannot interdict at this stage.’’Opposing Torrent’s plea Sibal said the “whole process has been stymied contrary to the court’’. He urged the Tribunal to declare Torrent’s application as “non maintainable’’, also premature, and to dismiss it saying, “CoC be allowed to proceed in accordance with court and law.’’Salve for Indus International Holdings ( Hinduja group company ) said the “purpose of the insolvency court is not to create an avenue for lucrative investment. The company belonging to a group of shareholders is not a largesse of the government to be distributed. And therefore all these notions saying you cannot have multiple biddings…is completely misconceived.’’ Salve submitted, “Unless there is an express statutory bar, the general principle of whether or not to accept a resolution plan at all must lie with the CoC, or administrator or Resolution Professional as the case may be.’’ Salve added later, “Public monies have been given to a corporate debtor and public monies have to come in, Torrent cannot enrich itself at the cost of the Indian tax payer.’’Khambata in rejoinder began by saying Sibal and Salve argued that its plea was premature, and asked how on December 23, the administrator said the plan was unfair to Torrent. Khambata said, “a new process is a wipe out.’’ The NCLT asked Khambata to continue and conclude on Friday and posted the matter high on board.The controversy arose after a Hinduja entity’s bid higher by Rs 300 crore than Torrent’s but allegedly made after the bid deadline. Torrent challenged the late bid by Hinduja and said its bid ought to be accepted as the winning bid.The CoC felt there was greater value to the asset of Reliance Capital and decided to proceed with a fresh round.The Administrator appointed was Nageswara Rao Y.

So far, Netmeds, the e-pharmacy chain majority controlled by Reliance Retail, has focused on the online sale and delivery of medicines. Interestingly, the move comes on the heels of discount supermarket chain Dmart announcing plans to set up pharmacies within its stores. Reliance Retail plans to open over 2,000 standalone pharmacy stores in a year, with the first outlet having been opened in Chennai recently, sources told TOI. Most of India’s over eight lakh retail pharmacies are small, independent businesses, and majorly concentrated in metros, tier-1 and -2 cities. The aggressive expansion by biggies like Apollo, and e-commerce platforms like Netmeds, Tata 1mg, Amazon and Flipkart Health+ could pose serious competition for the brick-and-mortar pharmacies, experts say. E-pharmacies including Tata 1mg and Pharmeasy are understood to be experimenting with offline stores for an omni-channel play. An email sent to Reliance Retail went unanswered. The company currently operates around 1,000 shop-in-shop pharma stores across Reliance Smart Bazaar in cities, and Smart Point stores in towns and villages. Typically, a shop-in-shop is a store within a store, retailing a product or service distinct from that of the main occupant. A foray into the pharmacy business through a shop-in-shop or a standalone format indicates options online grocery platforms could explore to widen customer base. Only a small percentage of the Indian population orders medicines from online channels currently, with consumers in smaller towns looking for reliable pharmacies.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ril-expands-netmeds-offline-launches-stores/articleshow/97429672.cms,2

In all, about 29% of the group’s market capitalisation, or about Rs 5.6 lakh crore, has been eroded in the last three trading sessions.The steep slide in the conglomerate’s stocks — which started on Wednesday after US-based short seller Hindenburg Research released a report criticising the group — also pushed its chairman Gautam Adani to the eighth spot among the world’s richest, down from seventh on Friday and third a week earlier. With a net worth of $88.2 billion (about Rs 7.2 lakh crore), Asia’s richest person is just $4.1 billion (about Rs 33,000 crore) ahead of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, who’s at the 10th spot, according to Forbes' real time billionaire index.The sharp sell-off came despite the group on Sunday night releasing a 413-page document to answer 88 queries from Hindenburg Research. 97463784Adani Ent FPO crawls: 3% in 2 daysThe Rs 20,000-crore follow-on public offering (FPO) by Adani Enterprises (AEL) received just 3% subscription on the second day of the bidding. The development comes even as the Abu Dhabi-based conglomerate International Holding Company (IHC) agreed to invest $400 million (about Rs 3,200 crore) in the issue. IHC is an existing investor in AEL and the latest commitment will be its second deal in the flagship of the Adani Group. 97428362By close of bidding on Monday, AEL garnered bids for nearly 14 lakh shares, representing 3% of the total 4.6 crore shares that’s on offer, data on the BSE website showed. The FPO, sold in the Rs 3,112-3,276 per share price range, is higher than AEL’s Monday closing price of Rs 2,879 on the BSE. The offer is set to close on Tuesday. 97469406At close of bidding on the second day, the part reserved for retail investors was subscribed 4% of the allotted quota, employees’ portion 13%, while the HNI (non-institutional investors) portion was subscribed 4%. Qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) had bid for 4,576 shares of the 1.3 crore shares earmarked for them. Usually, institutions and HNIs bid on the last day of an offer. AEL expects three family offices from the UK, Qatar and Bahrain to invest a sizeable amount in the FPO on the last day. 97469441On Monday, Abu Dhabi’s IHC said it will subscribe to 16% of AEL’s FPO. It will route the investment through its subsidiary Green Transmission Investment Holding RSC. Once the FPO concludes successfully, IHC’s stake in AEL will go up from the current 4%. In April 2022, it had announced an investment of Rs 7,700 crore in AEL as part of its broader capital infusion in Adani Group companies.97457540IHC has also invested Rs 3,850 crore each in Adani Transmission and Adani Green Energy. “The advantage of the FPO is the historical reference for the company’s earnings report, company’s management, business practices, and much data to bank on before making any investment decision,” said IHC CEO Syed Basar Shueb. He added, “We see a strong potential for growth from a long-term perspective.” 97431889Since AEL is issuing partly paid-up shares, investors in the FPO will pay Rs 1,638 per share in the first tranche, at the upper end of the price band. They will pay the balance amount at a later date.On day one of the offer (January 27), the FPO was subscribed 1%. The day before the FPO opened for bidding, AEL’s Rs 5,985-crore anchor book, a part of the QIB portion, was fully subscribed. Consequently, the shares reserved for bidding was reduced to 4.6 crore shares from the initial 6.5 crore shares.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-group-loses-29-market-value-in-3-days-as-carnage-continues/articleshow/97463657.cms,1

At the top of the list is French luxury fashion giant's LMVH's Bernard Arnault and family. In December 2022, Louis Vuitton's founder and CEO Bernard Arnault overtook Elon Musk as the world's richest person.However, these values fluctuate constantly. If there is a gain in Adani's stock, it is expected Adani's personal wealth will rise too.This comes following a report by US short-seller Hindenburg Research on the Adani Group alleging a decades-long fraud scheme, ""brazen accounting fraud, stock manipulation and money laundering.""The Adani Group, however, said it was mulling legal options in the US and India against Hindenburg Research after its report accused firms owned by Gautam Adani of market manipulation and accounting fraud.In a sharp and focused response to Hindenburg Research's report on its businesses, the Adani Group responded to all 88 questions raised by Hindenburg including the young age of its auditors.Hindenburg then hit back stating that the Adani Group's accusations are ""baseless.""Shares of Adani Group firms fell in morning trade today. However, the key market indices opened with gains as investors' sentiments were boosted over Union Budget expectations.Shares of Adani Enterprises, the flagship firm of the group, fell 3.02 per cent to Rs 2,880.20 apiece on the BSE.

The Rs 59,000 crore deal with France for 36 Rafale fighters, which was inked in September 2016, does not figure in this list.Bhatt, on his part, said, “The Defence Acquisition Procedure-2020 with a focus on `Atmanirbhar Bharat’ and `Make in India’ introduced major policy initiatives for boosting indigenous defence capability and reduction of reliance on imports.”“Further, DAP-2020 provides the highest preference to Buy Indian (IDDM) category of acquisition and Buy Global is only permitted in exceptional situations with specific approval of the Defence Acquisitions Council or the defence minister,” he added.97431129 In a separate answer, Bhatt said the DRDO is working on 55 `mission mode’ projects at a total sanctioned cost of Rs 73,943 crore. These projects are in the areas of nuclear defence technologies, air-independent propulsion (AIP) for submarines, combat suites, torpedoes, fighter aircraft, cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, gas turbine engine, assault rifles, warheads, light machine guns, rockets, advanced towed artillery gun systems, infantry combat vehicles, surface-to-air missiles, anti-ship missiles, anti-airfield weapons and glide bombs.As reported by TOI earlier, India remains ahead of Russia and the UK as the third largest military spender in the world, but far behind China that spends four times and the US 10 times its defence budget.The government has taken some steps to get India out of its strategically-vulnerable position as the world’s largest arms importer, accounting for 11% of the global weapons imports.

The Ashok Leyland manufactured truck with two large hydrogen cylinders was put up at a hall adjacent to the main venue where Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the three-day event that is themed around 'Growth, Collaboration, Transition'.  A display near the truck said this was ""India's 1st H2ICE technology truck on road.""  The truck has ""near-zero emissions"" when it uses hydrogen as fuel in place of conventional diesel or even recently introduced liquefied natural gas (LNG).  ""H2ICE vehicle performance on-par with diesel ICE,"" it said.  H2 is the formula for hydrogen and ICE stands for internal combustion engine.  India is fast pushing for use of hydrogen, which can be produced by splitting water using electricity. Use of electricity generated from renewable sources such as solar and wind qualifies it to be green hydrogen.  Hydrogen finds wide applicability, from refineries to steel plants and fertilizer units where it can replace hydrocarbons. Hydrogen can also be used as fuel in automobiles but its current cost of manufacturing is very high. But this hasn't stopped companies from investing in hydrogen manufacturing.  Last month, billionaire Gautam Adani's group announced plans for a hydrogen truck.  In January, Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL), part of the diversified Adani portfolio of companies, signed an agreement to launch a pilot project to develop a hydrogen fuel cell electric truck (FCET) for mining logistics and transportation with Ashok Leyland, India, and Ballard Power, Canada.  The hydrogen powered mining truck will weigh 55 tons, have three hydrogen tanks, a 200-km working range, and will be powered by Ballard's 120 kW PEM fuel cell technology.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBFBgbSREZw The Adani Group had previously announced its plans to invest more than USD 50 billion over the next 10 years in green hydrogen and associated ecosystems corresponding to a capacity of up to 3 million tons of green hydrogen annually.  The oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance too is pivoting a green path, investing in renewable energy power generation as well as the entire hydrogen ecosystem as part of its decarbonisation plans.  Reliance is investing Rs 6 lakh crore (USD 80 billion) in multiple green energy projects in Gujarat as part of the company's increasingly ambitious decarbonisation drive.  It will invest Rs 5 lakh crore over the span of 10 to 15 years to set up 100 GW renewable-energy power plant and green-hydrogen ecosystem development. It has started the process of scouting land for 100 GW renewable energy power projects in Kutch, Banaskantha and Dholera, and has requested 450,000 acres of land in Kutch.  The company will spend an additional Rs 60,000 crore in setting up 'new energy manufacturing', which includes solar modules, electrolysers, batteries for energy storage and fuel cells.  Another Rs 25,000 crore will be invested in existing projects and new ventures in the next three to five years.  Reliance in 2021 first talked of a multi-billion investment plan spanning renewables, storage and hydrogen, including what it claims will be the world's largest green energy equipment 'giga-complex' and a 100GW capacity goal.  The investment over three years would propel Reliance to net-zero emissions status by 2035.  At the display alongside the hydrogen truck, Reliance said use of hydrogen results in 20 per cent fuel operating expense saving over diesel ICE vehicles. It also results in 10-15 per cent noise reduction over diesel ICE vehicles, it added.  Adani Group plans to invest USD 20 billion over the next decade in renewable-energy generation and component manufacturing, with an aim to become ""the producer of the least expensive green electron anywhere in the world"".  It intends to triple its renewable-power generation capacity over the next four years, become a green-hydrogen producer, power all of its data centres by renewable energy by 2030, achieve net-zero emissions at its ports by 2025, and allocate more than 75 per cent of capital expenditure up to 2025 on green technologies.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/news/reliance-showcases-hydrogen-run-truck-at-india-energy-week/articleshow/97640660.cms,2

With a loading capacity of 19-35 tons, the H2-ICE heavy-duty truck helps quick migration to cleaner energy at relatively lower cost delta, says the official statement. “Working with RIL, we have once again demonstrated our technological leadership, and our commitment to the Clean Mobility Mission,” says Dr. N Saravanan, President and Chief Technology Officer, Ashok Leyland. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGBHa8DXOEkFurther, he added, “Our aim is to make India’s alternate fuel segment self-reliant and be one of the flag bearers of the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ campaign”. The H2-ICE technology seems to be promising for clean mobility; however, the cost is high owing to limited hydrogen fuel availability. The Central government is working on the National Hydrogen Energy Roadmap and promotional activities like the National Hydrogen Energy Mission.

This joint initiative aims to offer need-based training to rural women and individuals from low-income groups.What is the Digital Skills ProgramAs a part of this program, the GSMA and Jio teams worked together to assess prevalent digital skill gaps and develop need-based digital skills training toolkits that are India-specific. The toolkits were designed post extensive field research and user feedback. Over 1,000 rural women and men from Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu participated and provided inputs for the refinement of the digital training toolkits during the trial phase.Presently, the program is being rolled out in 10 states with a focus on reaching women and marginalized groups. Reliance Foundation will be supporting the rollout through its large network and self-help groups.What the company said about the Digital Skills ProgramIsha Ambani, Director, Reliance Jio, said, ""Mobile technology has the power to empower women, making them feel more connected, independent, and secure, and providing them with access to important information that helps them in their daily lives. We are proud to partner with GSMA in this program to take digital skills training to the women across India and be the wind beneath their wings.""On the other hand, GSMA Director General, Mats Granryd said, ""Mobile technology has the potential to positively contribute to protecting women's human rights and to strengthen their economic, social, and political empowerment and development. But more needs to be done to ensure women are not being left behind in an increasingly connected world. We are excited to partner with Jio and Reliance Foundation to take the Digital Skills Program national and help accelerate digital inclusion for women.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/reliance-jio-and-gsma-roll-out-digital-skills-program-in-the-country/articleshow/97690899.cms,2

The introduction of the digital rupee across all of Reliance Retail's stores is predicted to happen soon. Only one restaurant in Mumbai, Freshpik, has started to accept digital rupee as of right now. The Supreme Court has recommended that ICICI and Kotak be the collaborating banks. Operations on the backend will be handled by Innoviti Payment Solutions.Innoviti will be the first robust technology platform where individuals will be able to transact using digital rupee. It is expected that digital rupee will soon be accepted in 17,000 of its stores. Furthermore, banks will assist Reliance in developing the front end, while Innoviti will provide back end solutions as well as infrastructure deployment for accepting digital rupee. ""Once we test out everything, and are sure of all the regulatory aspects of it, we will be rolling it out pan India at the earliest. However, we must have all of the regulatory pieces in place, as well as apps available from all banks, so that it is acceptable to all consumers. As soon as we get a green signal from everybody, we'll go ahead and launch it in other stores. The digital rupee will be operational in the remaining Mumbai stores within the next few months. So in the coming few months, e-RUPI will be available in at least 500 of our stores. Then, as we expand beyond Mumbai, it will cover 7,000 towns and villages. So that's what we're aiming for.""

Buyers have shifted some transactions to the currency, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Payments vary from cargo to cargo, depending in part on the demands of specific traders, said the people, who requested anonymity as the details are private. Reliance, BPCL and Nayara didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The European Union’s recent ban on imports of refined oil products from Russia has positioned India as an increasingly important customer for the shipments. Russia has been India’s top crude supplier since June as cargoes previously bound for Europe have been diverted to Asia — often sold at well below the $60-a-barrel cap.97747820The UAE dirham provides both Indian buyers and Russian sellers with a relatively predictable currency — pegged to the dollar — without the greenback’s potential sanctions complications. Even on deals that don’t directly violate US and EU restrictions, some intermediary banks often take additional steps to avoid any risks to other banking relationships abroad.India is the UAE’s second-largest trade partner and officials are working on a mechanism to boost trade in dirhams and rupees. Most oil deals are still being transacted in dollars. India’s oil minister said he was unaware of the use of dirham in oil purchases. “If you are asking me officially am I in the know of these payment channels, no, I’m not,” Hardeep Singh Puri said in a Monday interview in Bengaluru. Officials are open to holding discussion with other countries on the issue, he said. “If the need arises, we will need to talk.”India is probably willing to accommodate requests from Russia to offer payment in dirham, considering the bargain prices offered on crude, according to Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights. Still, a move away from the US dollar could risk drawing the ire of some officials in Washington. Last week, the US Treasury Department’s top sanctions official Brian Nelson traveled to Abu Dhabi, voicing concerns about the UAE’s close financial ties to Russia.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-bpcl-among-buyers-using-uae-currency-for-russian-oil/articleshow/97747824.cms,1

Companies like Bank of Baroda and CG Power have been added, while Biocon has been crossed off the list.Market analysts anticipate that CG Power will experience a sizable inflow of capital as a result of its inclusion in the MSCI Global Standard Index. They expect a weightage of 0.27%, indicating that CG Power will comprise a small but meaningful portion of the index, as well as an inflow of $161 million, which is nearly 12 times its 20-day average daily volume. Bank of Baroda's inclusion in the MSCI Global Standard Index is expected to result in a significant influx of capital into the company. The expected weightage of 0.24% would indicate that Bank of Baroda would make up a small but meaningful portion of the index, and the estimated inflow of $145 million would be substantial relative to the company's average daily trading volume.The removal of Biocon from the MSCI Global Standard Index is expected to result in a significant outflow of capital from the company. The expected weightage reduction of 0.14% would imply that Biocon would no longer constitute a significant portion of the index, as would the estimated outflow of $68 million, which is nearly 11 times its 20-day average trading volume.However, On Adani Group stocks, MSCI has reduced the weightage of four Adani Group companies in its quarterly review, which is likely to impact the market capitalization of these companies. MSCI stated that certain investors in the Adani Group companies might not be considered as public investors, which has led to a reduction in the free float market capitalization.The reduction in weightage of Adani Group stocks by 0.82 basis points is expected to result in a significant outflow of capital from the company. According to analysts, the outflow of $428 million could be substantial, although this amount is lower than what was expected by the market a day before the announcement was made.It has to be noted that, none of the Adani stocks that are a part of the MSCI index have been removed from the index, it's just a reduction of weightage that has happened in the Adani Group companies. Now for Adani Enterprises, they are expecting the weight to reduce by around 0.3 basis points, which could lead to an outflow of $161 million U, which is nearly 0.6 times its 20-day average volume. In case of Adani Transmission and Adani Total Gas, the weightage is coming off by around 0.2 - 0.3 basis points and the outflow expected is close to $110–$145 million. Additionally, for ACC, the weightage is coming off by only 0.02 basis points, which would lead to an outflow of only $12 million, which is just 0.3 times its 20-day average daily volume. The weightage of stocks such as Reliance Industries, HDFC, Infosys, ICICI Bank, and TCS has increased. The weighting has increased by approximately 0.04 to 0.1 basis points. Apart from that, MSCI has added nearly 25 Indian companies to their MSCI Global Small Cap indexes. Some of them include GR Infraprojects, Spandana Sphoorty Finance, Techno Electric & Engineering, and Ion Exchange India. All of these stocks have been actively traded, and the Global Small Cap indexes now list their names. Analysts expect inflows into these companies to be in the range of 2.6 - 7.7 times their 20-day average volume, resulting in a sharp up move in all of these stocks.Source: ET Now",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/msci-review-adani-group-stocks-bank-of-baroda-cg-power-and-biocon-in-focus/articleshow/97802006.cms,1

The project aims to conduct 1,00,000 Artificial Inseminations annually and establish 400 new commercial farms every year.The project also focuses on clusterization, creation of mandis, abattoirs and common facility centers (CFCs), to support marketing and value addition of the sector, he said.The existing mutton production is not only of insufficient quantity but also lacks quality and is not FSSAI compliant, putting consumers at risk.The majority of the livestock population is held by Bakerwals who follow traditional methods of farming, resulting in low productivity and profits.The UT has less than five breeds of sheep with the majority being dual purpose breeds such as Kashmir Merino, Rambouillet, and Corriedale. However, there is increasing demand for fast-growing mutton breeds like Dorper, Romnov, South Down and others, they said.The expected output from the project include import of 2700 high genetic merit and elite sheep and goats, increased lambing percentage from 80 to 120 and considerable reduction in marketable age for sheep and goats (40-50 kg in 6 months), they officials said.The project aims to double the farm income through early weight gain, improved carcass yield and production and reduce lamb mortality. Effective health cover is expected to prevent production losses by 20-30 percent and provide consumers with safe and quality meat, they said.""The project is anticipated to bring significant benefits to farmers and consumers in Jammu and Kashmir. The creation of commercial farms and establishment of breed-based farms will boost mutton production and improve the quality of meat available to consumers"", Dulloo said.The marketing and value addition initiatives will help farmers get better returns for their produce, while health cover and nutrition interventions will reduce production losses and improve the overall well-being of the animals.The project will also create job opportunities and promote entrepreneurship, contributing to the economic development of the region, they said.

But neither are they about to collapse in a heap of governance failures.”In its January 24 report, short seller Hindenburg Research alleged accounting fraud and stock manipulation by Gautam Adani, triggering a stock rout at the billionaire empire, wiping out $127 billion off the group’s market value. Adani has repeatedly denied the accusations.It has a relatively low proportion of freely-tradeable shares, which means excessive control by founders that led to rich valuations, the economists said. It also has one of the lowest liquidity ratios among peers, they added. Its flagship firm Adani Enterprises Ltd is covered by just two analysts, against an average of 33 for the 50 biggest companies, according to the report. Though the group is highly leveraged compared to peers, its profits are sufficient to cover interest expenses, it said. The crisis has raised questions about India’s credibility as a global growth engine and a destination for international investors. Earlier this month, MSCI reduced the free float of four companies owned by Adani, while Moody’s Investors Service cut its outlook on Adani Green Energy and three other group firms.“Short sellers likely won’t be dominating the narrative on India Inc in years ahead,” the economists said. “With India’s GDP once again set to outperform, the country’s firms will have a chance to take another step on the path from national champions to global majors.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gautam-adani-crisis-likely-to-leave-indias-conglomerates-unscathed/articleshow/97901011.cms,1

Analysts believe that the share price of India's most valuable company has broken out again and is poised for further gains in the coming days. RIL is a stock that has been quite an outperformer and has been proving its might within the large-cap space. Analysts also stated that RIL stock is a more coherent type of interesting indicator breakout when viewed in the context of the shares' growth chart. Looking at the Reliance Industries chart, which spans the last 12-13 months, roughly beginning in 2022, It's easy to see that there has been many potential breakouts, indicating that RIL's share is more known as a trendsetter in the market. The breakout occurred in June 2022, when the stock was almost at 2500 levels, and marked the beginning of a trend for the stock. This was almost a 10% swing for Reliance Industries. From the 2500–2550 mark, the stock increased to as high as 2800 levels. This was observed in July 2022, when the stock first entered a period of consolidation. After this period of consolidation, a breakout was confirmed, and the stock began to move toward levels around the 2750 mark. Similarly, in September, another breakout was seen where the stock bottomed out.Look at the stock's consolidation, and then after the breakout, the stock began to trend, and in a matter of one and a half months, the stock confirmed a 10% swing. Now this is exactly very similar in terms of the price structure. As you can see from previous examples, the stock goes into a correction, consolidates for two to three weeks, and then begins to trend. Analysts suggest that this is a similar type of breakout to what is happening with the RIL share. They add that, yesterday's move is confirmed by the kind of sudden change in the open trade. As you can see, Reliance Industries' open trade has hardly changed over the past five days. With the indicator breakout, analysts anticiapate that this could be a strong 10% up move over the next 2-3 months.Source: ET Now",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/is-ril-shares-set-for-a-breakout/articleshow/97937548.cms,2

Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which invited US-led sanctions, germinated the idea of rupee trade as India boosted its purchases of cheap oil from Moscow to contain a rising import bill amid high commodity prices.But increasing trade deficitNo payment has been initiated because Russian banks do not want excess rupee piling up. The gap between their exports and imports is rising and the slow progress in the rupee trade with Russia could add to pressure on the local currency which slipped the most against the dollar among emerging Asian currencies in the past 12 months.Payment challengePayment in rubles is also a challenge because there is no fixed exchange rate for the currency. India's biggest company by market value Reliance Industries Ltd and BPCL are among Indian refiners using dirhams to pay for some shipments of Russian crude as they navigate Western sanctions.Rupee planIndia is betting on internationalisation of the rupee to reduce dollar demand and make its economy less vulnerable to global shocks after the current account deficit, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, widened to a record in July-September.The plan to allow overseas trade to be settled in rupees was announced by the Reserve Bank of India in July 2022.

As a result, the Sensex sank by 928 points, the biggest fall in the year so far. After a relatively flat start, the index dived deeper into the red and closed at 59,745 points, down 1.5% on the day with all but one of its 30 constituents - ITC - closing down.A fresh selloff in Adani stocks, along with relentless offloading by foreign funds, also weighed on investor sentiment, market players said.98166693In the last two weeks, a series of strong economic data in the US, the world's largest economy, have raised expectations among economists and analysts that the American central bank will again raise interest rates aggressively in the next few months. This has been weighing on investor sentiment globally which led to a nearly 3% fall in the Dow Jones and other leading Wall Street indices on Tuesday.According to Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, while some of the key US macro data pointed towards a stronger economy, inflation continued to remain stubbornly higher. As a result, ""there is an increasing fear that the US Fed may remain hawkish for a longer duration than expected, which may even force the RBI to keep interest rates high"". In addition to these, statements from both Russian and US Presidents led to some increase in geopolitical tensions, which added to the current uncertainty in the markets, Khemka said in a note.The day's slide also left investors poorer by Rs 4 lakh crore with the BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 264.6 lakh crore. Among the Sensex constituents, Reliance Industries contributed the most to the index's loss, followed by HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. The day's net selling figure by foreign funds came in at Rs 580 crore, BSE data showed.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-dives-928-pts-over-fears-of-sharper-rate-hikes/articleshow/98166566.cms,1

In September 2018, she delivered twin boys at 30 weeks’ gestation after an emergency C-section. They were admitted to NICU for life-saving treatment. The coverage for newborn babies “for any illness or injury” was introduced in the same year in the policies without additional premium.Joshi made a claim for Rs 11 lakh, but it was repudiated saying it does not cover premature babies. She moved HC, with her advocate Ashok Shetty arguing the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) has defined ‘newborn baby’ to mean a baby born during the policy period and up to 90 days in age. The judges rejected the insurer’s reliance on three doctors’ opinion that complications developed in the twins due to their premature birth and would not usually occur in a baby born full term. They also junked a bid to make a distinction between expenses for a newborn’s illness or injury and expenses relating to premature babies, pointing out an injury could result from a baby being born premature or preterm. “The further distinction between a ‘newborn’ and a ‘premature baby’ or a baby born ‘pre-term’ is also baseless as a newborn baby can be one born ‘full term’ or ‘pre-term’. A full-term baby does not become more ‘newer’ any more than a ‘pre-term’ baby becomes an ‘earlier born’ or, to make it even more pointed, ‘old born’,” Justice Neela Gokhale wrote for the bench. The judges said New India’s approach is unreasonable, unjust and contrary to the fundamental utmost good faith ethic of an insurance provider. “These submissions are the sheerest casuistry (excuse). They cannot be allowed to succeed,” said the judgment, directing that Rs 11 lakh be paid with interest from December 2018, the date of claim, till the actual amount is paid to Joshi.The judges noted that it took the young mother and professional a “roller-coaster litigation” process to bring the matter to its logical end. “The petitioner mother had not even had the time to revel in the birth of her twin babies and nurse them to health when she faced the rude shock of rejection of her legitimate claim/s by the insurance company,” they said. The bench directed the insurer to also pay Joshi Rs 5 lakh as cost of litigation, “prompted in addition by its defiance in obeying the directives of its regulator”. They directed all amounts to be paid within four weeks.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-insurers-act-unjust-against-good-faith-ethic/articleshow/98349669.cms,1

Reliance Industries Ltd., led by Asia’s richest person, acquired the Bengaluru-based firm in 2021 and now owns about 80% of it. The genome test, which is about 86% cheaper than other offerings available locally, can reveal a person’s predisposition to cancers, cardiac and neuro-degenerative ailments as well as identify inherited genetic disorders, he said. The project to bring affordable personal gene-mapping to India’s 1.4 billion people — on track to be the world’s most populous nation — will potentially create a treasure trove of biological data that can aid drug development and disease prevention in the region. It also dovetails with Ambani’s ambitions to dive further into the world of data — he has often called it the “new oil” — as he pivots his $192 billion empire beyond refining into consumer and digital services.“It’ll be the cheapest such genomic profile in the world,” Hariharan said, who also co-founded Strand Life Sciences. “We’re going out at an aggressive price point to drive adoption as it gives us a chance to build a viable business in preventive health care.” Health red flagsWhile ancestry reports from 23andMe can be bought for $99, its health plus ancestry reports cost $199. Full genome sequencing for health red flags costs more than $1,000 from Indian rivals, MapmyGenome and Medgenome. Cheapest offerings from some Chinese firms come for as low as 599 yuan ($87) but may not map the entire gamut of diseases that Reliance-owned Strand aims to detect.A representative for Reliance Industries did not respond to an emailed request for comments.Price disruption comes naturally to Ambani, who deployed a similar cut-throat strategy after it entered retail in 2006 and telecommunications in 2016, blowing out competition until Reliance emerged the market leader in both sectors. The global genetic testing market was valued at $12.7 billion in 2019 and is expected to touch $21.3 billion by 2027, according to a report from Allied Market Research. The new genome testing service “will ideally lead to creation of a big pool of data which will help development of targeted treatment and early intervention,” said Vishal Manchanda, senior vice president at Systematix Institutional Equities, when told about Reliance’s new product. But low prices alone may not be enough to lure people in a market like India where awareness of such services and their benefits are relatively untested. Though cheaper than global rivals, Reliance’s $145 price tag is still a lot for the average consumer in India, where nearly two-thirds of the population lives on less than $2 a day.Aggressively marketedReliance’s digital services and its recent e-commerce acquisitions can be deployed to push its genome testing product, which just needs blood samples that can be collected at home.Currently being piloted by a small number of early testers, it will be aggressively marketed by Reliance in the coming weeks on its MyJio app, with an outreach of 425 million wireless subscribers of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., health app JioHealthHub and the recently acquired e-pharmacy, Netmeds, Hariharan said.While a lot of consumer interest in the US has been around tracking ancestry or characteristics as such as athletic abilities, hair texture and propensity toward obesity — tests labeled ‘recreational genetics’ — the longer-term business model of these services centers around preventative health care.'Genetic linkWith more genomic data, global drugmakers could potentially develop new drugs as well as gain insight into how to better target existing therapies. This could be particularly useful in genetically under-mapped India, for example in helping prove a genetic link to certain over-represented diseases in the country.Still, these ambitions have yet to come to fruition anywhere, and early movers like 23andMe are now facing regulatory pressure: the US Food and Drug Administration barred from the company from making any health-related claims in 2013 and put it through a two-year review process. In 2015, the regulator allowed 23AndMe to offer health-related testing.While Strand said it will incorporate latest scientific research in interpreting the test results, India has still not set regulatory standards for genetic tests. Also, it will be the company’s first product in an inherently fast-changing and complicated scientific field.Hariharan said the new genome testing being rolled out by the Reliance group will “set the standards” for India. “We will offer responsible consumer genomics by staying close to the science.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/asias-richest-man-mukesh-ambani-to-foray-into-genome-testing-with-rs-12000-kit/articleshow/98348703.cms,2

The steps have been taken to make metro most environment-friendly, provide power supply to the stations and reduce carbon footprint.On the lines of Delhi metro model, the Patna metro has planned to use solar power energy for auxiliary services at the stations, like elevators, escalators, lighting, signalling, telecommunication, firefighting and fare collection system.The Patna Metro Rail Corporation spokesperson said considering the futuristic technology and potential for solar power generation, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (DMRC), the nodal agency of the Patna metro project, will implement rooftop grid-connected solar power panels at selected locations of elevated stations and maintenance depot. “The solar panels installed on the rooftop of the metro stations will generate clean and green energy, which will aid constant power supply at Patna metro stations,” he said.The solar panels will generate approximately 6.5 megawatts of electricity per day. Different sheds and buildings of the establishment are proposed to be used for solar photovoltaic (SPV) installation to optimize the solar energy potential. The requirement of power at each elevated station is expected to be 200kW-300kW and for each underground station 1500kW-2000kW. According to officials, the solar power will be transferred to the underground stations from depot, proposed near the Patliputra Bus Terminal.“This initiative for Patna metro will not only reduce the reliance on non-renewable sources of energy but is also in line with the central government’s target of achieving 50% cumulative electric power from renewable resources by 2030 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.

China has also been buying ESPO at above the price cap level, according to Reuters calculations.Indian companies are using non-dollar currencies to settle payment for certain niche Russian crudes and are avoiding use of Western services and banks to avoid sanctions.Competition from India has narrowed discounts for April-loading ESPO shipments to about $6.80 a barrel against June ICE Brent DES basis to northern China from $8.50 a barrel last month for March-loading oil, three trading sources said.Similar quality Murban crude from Abu Dhabi was traded at a premium of around $3.30 a barrel to Dubai quotes on a free-on-board basis.In comparison, April-loading Murban crude is about $9 a barrel more expensive than ESPO delivered to China and India, according to Reuters calculations.Seaborne ESPO crude exports averaged 800,000 barrels per day in 2022, Kpler's data showed, accounting for 17.3% of Russia's total seaborne exports.Exports of flagship Russian grade Urals averaged 1.74 million bpd, although Moscow has cut exports from its western ports by 10% in March from the previous month.Meanwhile, China's buying spree of ESPO continues as the country emerges from its zero-COVID regime, prompting a rebound in fuel demand from industry and the travel sector.China's seaborne imports of Russian oil are set to hit a record of nearly 43 million barrels this month, including at least 20 million barrels of ESPO.The solid demand drove the lumpsum freight rates for tankers carrying crude from Russia's Far East port Kozmino, a major ESPO export hub, to northern China to an all-time high of $2.4 million in February before easing to $2.3 million this month, Simpson Spence Young data on Refinitiv Eikon showed.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-jostles-with-china-for-april-espo-crude-from-russia-prices-jump/articleshow/98543407.cms,0

National Institute For Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST) should take it up as a challenge,” Kalaiselvi said while inaugurating the ‘One Week One Lab Programme’ of CSIR-NIIST at its campus at Pappanamcode. As Kerala is known for its heritage in rubber, NIIST can work with farmers and make rubber cultivation as an end-to-end support system, which will help create employment, rubber-based industries and farmers could be given more than enough benefits and advantages, she said. “We are having dependence on a lot of countries for rubber-based products whether it is tyre or value-added rubber products. When the country is talking about Atmanirbhar Bharat, self-reliance and Make in India initiatives, NIIST has to take up the new initiative by trying to promote more farmers into rubber cultivation and help them get a cherishable income,” she added. Noting that the next 25 years of India is scientifically important, Kalaiselvi urged researchers to adopt one industry problem by each one of them and address it and take a maximum of three years to come up with a solution.

But since the Covid-19 outbreak and Ukraine invasion, top business profits h","Rs 3,79,768.4 crore. The top 20 profit-makers of the country had combined profits of Rs 3,79,768.4 crore in 2021-22. It’s a number the government provided in the Budget session of Parliament this year in response to a question.How much is Rs 3,79,768.4 crore worth? It’s 2.2 times the capital outlay for defence4.3 times the money set aside for the health ministryAnd 123 times the budget for the environmentSo what? Businesses are meant to make money. If they are doing well, it should mean the economy is doing well, yes?Let’s see. Before the pandemic and the Ukraine invasion, profits of the top 20 gainers — combined — were either dropping or stagnant. The combined profits went from Rs 2.4 lakh crore to Rs 3.8 lakh crore in five years — an average increase of 9.7% a year. But if we go year by year, this is what we find.In 2018-19, the total dropped 3.4% since the previous financial yearIn 2019-20, it rose 0.7%But in 2020-21, it shot up 23.2%And the year after that, till only October 2022, it had grown 32.7%So, the growth all happened in the two years of the pandemic and was pushed further up since the Ukraine invasion. Who are these profit-makers and how much (or little) have they helped our economy?  <iframe title=""The top 20 profit-makers have been from this pool of 33 companies for 5 years now"" aria-label=""Bar Chart"" id=""datawrapper-chart-FchnJ"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/FchnJ/1/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""952"" data-external=""1""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>Who are the regulars?As we saw in the chart above, the list of top 20 has been a draw from a pool of 33 for the past five years. Eight of them — Reliance Industries, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Power Grid Corporation of India, ITC, Infosys, Wipro and HCL — have never been out of the list. Whichever way we cut it, Reliance Industries remains the biggest profit generator. We went over data going back two decades and found that its average profits have been about Rs 22,000 crore a year, by far the highest. How did it get here? In the early 2000s, the oil and gas production space was dominated by ONGC. Reliance Industries was making profits but not surpassing the public sector company. In a decade, the numbers started flipping and by 2015, Reliance was well ahead. If we take 2014 as a cutoff point, its combined profits were Rs 1.4 lakh crore in the decade before 2014 — they went up to Rs 2.74 lakh crore in the nine years since. That’s almost double.Its primary contender, ONGC, is next with a two-decade average profit of Rs 18,400 crore. While it has done well consistently, the financial year ending 2022 was especially bountiful — profits went straight from Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 40,000 crore. All because the Ukraine invasion sent oil prices soaring and it got $76.62 for every barrel it sold in the financial year ending 2022 compared to the $42.78 a barrel it got the year before that (it got even more the first quarter of 2022-23, $108.54). It helped the Indian Oil Corporation as well. By 2019-20, the state-owned oil company had recorded the worst ever financial performance because of inventory losses and lower refining margins. Crude prices had dropped to $22 a barrel in March 2020. But the following year, it got its highest profits ever — from Rs 1,300 crore to almost Rs 22,000 crore. The first increase in three years. The Ukraine invasion pumped profits up even more, taking it up to Rs 24,000 crore.The same went for Bharat Petroleum (profits up from Rs 2,700 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 19,000 crore in 2020-21) and Hindustan Petroleum (from Rs 2,600 crore to Rs 10,700 crore). The energy sector has clearly been amassing profits.Among technology services companies, one conspicuous absence on the government list of top 20 for 2018-19 was Tata Consultancy Services. But the company did register profits of Rs 30,065 crore that year, beating expectations and actually getting the second highest profits in the country. Possibly an oversight. Its two-decade average profit has been Rs 15,600 crore with a consistent increase every year (barring the first year of the pandemic, when it went down a sliver).Infosys, Wipro and HCL, too, registered their best years in profits in 2021 — and did even better in 2022.  <iframe title=""This is how the top profit-makers got there"" aria-label=""Interactive line chart"" id=""datawrapper-chart-FXhpv"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/FXhpv/2/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""400"" data-external=""1""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>And the new entrants?Some names on the government list of top profit-makers stood out. Patanjali Foods, for instance, made about Rs 7,700 crore in profits in 2019-20 — landing the 12th position on the top profit-makers list that year. But if we see its financials, this wasn’t because of a sudden surge in profitability of the company (originally Ruchi Soya and acquired by Patanjali that year). It was because of a Rs 7,400 crore write-off of trade receivables and advances. If that exceptional item is taken into account (as the next year’s annual report actually does say), the profits were a modest Rs 224 crore. But a more relevant question to answer, perhaps, would be which companies entered the list in the two years of the pandemic. Some are easy to understand. A company like Serum Institute of India entering the top 20 a year into the pandemic is not surprising because it is one of the world’s largest vaccine makers. So, when the vaccine drive began, in 2022, its profits went from Rs 3,900 crore to Rs 11,000 crore in a year.Nor is the presence of Reliance Jio Infocomm in the list for the past two years — more than Rs 12,000 crore in 2020-21 and over Rs 14,800 crore the year after (only till October). Its market share is up from 26% in 2019 to almost 37% now.But four other companies — Bandhan Financial Holdings, Steel Authority of India, NMDC and Vedanta — could be considered outliers. The space Bandhan operates in, asset management, has not really had a presence in the top profit-makers’ list. The closest are HDFC and Power Finance Corporation, in the specialty finance sector. Meanwhile, Steel Authority of India made its first appearance in the top profit-makers’ list in 2021-22. Its profits have swung quite a bit in the past. In fact, between 2016 and 2018, it had total losses of more than Rs 7,300 crore. But by 2022, it had taken its profits to Rs 12,000 crore. Why? Because pig iron prices rose 53% in 2021 and then shot up again because of the Ukraine invasion to the highest prices in over a decade. When ferrous scrap is hard to come by, steelmakers use pig iron — and the invasion has made scrap scarce. Which also pushed steel prices up. For the entire sector. Companies saw their operating profits go up 60% in 2020-21 and 64% the following year, data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shows.Finally, the thing with NMDC and Vedanta is that the mining sector has generated an annual increase of 0.03% in profits over the past decade. And even that is because of the 3.65% annual growth before the pandemic. Since 2020, the sector’s profits have actually dipped about 9% each year. Against that backdrop, NMDC making Rs 9,400 crore and Vedanta making Rs 27,700 crore in profits is exceptional. <iframe title=""Oil &amp; gas and tech accounted for 53% of the top profits in the past five years"" aria-label=""Bar Chart"" id=""datawrapper-chart-g7z6R"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/g7z6R/1/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""568"" data-external=""1""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>So, are our economic sectors (and you) doing well?The Centre, in response to the same question in Parliament we started our story with, also provided the overall profits of the Indian economy for five years.

Mining wasn’t doing too well either. Nor was construction. The first year of the pandemic, as we do expect, took down most sectors. But the takeaway is that things were already slowing down in 2019 for most sectors. Overall, all companies combined had actually registered losses of 3.9% since the previous year, RBI data shows. <iframe title=""Only 4 cos in the top 20 both before and after the pandemic saw their profits decline during Covid-19"" aria-label=""Split Bars"" id=""datawrapper-chart-yGVLS"" src=""https://toi-infographics.indiatimes.com/graphs/yGVLS/1/"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"" height=""635"" data-external=""1""></iframe><script type=""text/javascript"">!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>Business support services, mining, manufacturing, iron and steel, and petroleum products were among the worst performing — they were all struggling with losses in 2019-20. There was some recovery from that low in 2020-21 (a 10.4% profit) and the following year (a 27.4% profit) — but nowhere near the rate at which the top profit-makers saw their gains grow. Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Steel, Indian Oil, JSW Steel and Bharat Petroleum saw their profits increase by more than the total profits they made in the two years before the pandemic.But how does it compare to global trends? An analysis by Aswath Damodaran at the Stern School of Business at New York University shows that in 60 sectors, profits have been growing faster in India than elsewhere. That includes medicines, healthcare and hospitals, oil and gas distribution, transportation, water and wholesale food. And where are profits growing slower in India than the world? Advertising, coal and energy, construction supplies, information services, retail and software. Not exactly industries that need to put people before profits.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-are-the-top-profit-makers-of-india/articleshow/98660053.cms,1

According to a report in Economic Times (ET), Airtel has extended the increase in base prepaid rates nationally across all 22 circles. Late last year, the company had increased base rates of its prepaid plans by as much as 57%. The move is a clear bid to improve its ARPU beyond the Rs 200 level said the report quoting a top company executive. The ARPU is a key performance metric for telcos. In November 2022, Airtel had initially implemented the tariff hike in Odisha and Haryana, and subsequently extended it to 19 markets. Kolkata, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh were the only circles where it was yet to roll out the higher base prepaid rates, and now this exercise too has been concluded. “As per our checks, Bharti Airtel has now further rolled out this plan across the three remaining circles, Gujarat, Kolkata and Madhya Pradesh (total of 22 circles)… it has the first-mover in taking entry-level tariffs higher as competition has still not reacted,” global brokerage Morgan Stanley said.Untitled Carousel 98516461New plans across the countryPost the price hike, Airtel’s minimum monthly recharge plan in all 22 circles for prepaid users starts at Rs 155. It offers subscribers unlimited voice calling, 1GB data and 300 text messages. Earlier, the company had a minimum plan with a talk time value of Rs 99 and only 200MB of mobile data with 28-day validity in these states. All these earlier plans have been withdrawn nationally.Airtel had reported an ARPU of Rs 193 in the December quarter, FY23. Earlier this month, brokerage CLSA had said that Airtel’s move to extend the hike to 19 markets would boost its ARPU by 3% immediately to Rs 199.Untitled Carousel 98639320Brokerage Jefferies told ET that it expects Airtel’s ARPU to rise by 4-5% annually due to the improvement in subscriber mix, especially as the telco has another 107 million voice subscribers on its network who are yet to upgrade to data. Presently, Airtel’s mobile tariffs, across plans, are 25-57% higher than Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio’s. Chairman Sunil Mittal had at Mobile World Congress trade show held in Barcelona, Spain, late last month had signalled further hikes as market response to the last round of hikes had been encouraging, reflected in low subscriber churn.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/airtel-extends-base-prepaid-plans-rate-hike-to-all-circles-across-the-country/articleshow/98680933.cms,0

They are hired by businesses and states around the world, at great expense. Whether it’s McKinsey, Bain and Boston Consulting Group, or PwC, KPMG, EY, Deloitte and so on, these companies promise expertise and innovation in management strategy, accountancy, IT or climate solutions. What do consultants know, and what do they bring to the table? They offer some of the sought-after jobs, skimming the brightest grads from elite global universities. They promise new ideas, quantitative rigour and meticulousness, but this slicked-up business model evades risks and reaps rewards, say the authors. So what’s in it for the businesses and governments that hire consultancies? Sometimes, it is impression management, all about instilling confidence in clients through ‘brochuremanship’. Sometimes they are brought in to rubber-stamp a decision that has already been made by the management, like a difficult restructuring. Today omnipresent, the consulting business took wing in the late 1980s and 1990s, as the global neoliberal turn insisted that the market was the sole creator of value. As faith in the public sector plummeted, governments began enthusiastically contracting out their own functions. They welcomed public-private partnerships and private financing initiatives, so they could lower public debt in the books. Many years after that it turned out that the cost of servicing debts accrued through this method was twice as large as government borrowing in the UK. The consulting industry has soaked up every opportunity and weathered every downturn, from digitalising administrations to the financial recession, or Covid-response, or climate change interventions. In India, annual turnover of consulting firms increased by 10.8% annually on average in the five years to 2018. Budget allocations for professional services at the Niti Aayog increased nearly five-fold between 2016-17 and the following year, and subsequently rose by 30% in 2018-19. The book does not claim that consultants have no useful inputs, or that they are pulling a confidence trick. It is about examining the relationship between governments and consultancies. Organisations have tacit knowledge: the collective competence and skills of employees, and resources. The reliance on outside consultants erodes that institutional memory. For businesses, consultants may skew the focus towards value extraction rather than long-term investment in productive capabilities. For governments, the stakes are higher. The valued experiences of a long civil service career are lost, which undermine any public agency’s capacities. Politicians often work with consultancies too, which shapes their priorities in government. More than the enormous fees given to consultants by state agencies, the real problem is the lack of democratic accountability. They affect the lives and business or ordinary people, but this involvement is unknown and opaque to us. Consultancies are not to blame for the market-driven turn, the financialisation of the economy and hollowing out of the public sector. But it’s important to regulate the biz — that means strict rules on any conflicts of interest and disclosure of those contracting out duties. Governments must focus on their internal capacities, so that they can innovate from within. They must row so that they can steer — because the less they row, the less they learn, the less productive they become and the less they can steer.

While wheelchair-bound Ivan Sequeira and co-accused Ramesh Jagothia were pronounced not guilty, the case against two others — then senior executive at Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) Kirti Ambani and his alleged associate Arjun Babaria — was abated as they died during the pendency of the trial. The accused were out on bail.Wadia’s earlier statement to the CBI suggested that the prime accused was part of a “larger conspiracy” to eliminate him because of corporate rivalry.In 2003, the court charged the four accused for “criminally conspiring in 1988-89 to murder Wadia, then the chairman of Bombay Dyeing”. Ambani was charged with “instigating and abetting the commission of offence, which is punishable with death sentence”. He died in 2017. Jagothia was additionally charged under the Arms Act for the possession of a country-made revolver in July 1989.The prosecution alleged that the conspiracy was hatched somewhere in November 1988 between Kriti Ambani and Babaria. It was further alleged that Sequeria was also contacted by Babaria. The plan was to intercept Wadia’s car when he returned from his office to his residence at Prabhadevi and commit his murder. Sequeira was allegedly shown Wadia’s photograph and a huge sum of money was agreed to be paid. However, the conspiracy did not materialise. Kirti Ambani and Babaria were arrested in 1989. They were subsequently granted bail. Later, CBI took over the investigation and it was allegedly revealed that a roadside mechanic was also hired to obstruct Wadia’s car. It was also alleged that Jagothia was hired to aid in the murder.In 2014, after the prosecution had closed its case with the deposition of witnesses, Wadia moved court to record his evidence. His lawyer submitted that his deposition was relevant and essential for a just decision of the case. The lawyer said that Wadia was never contacted by the prosecution after April 2013. The court allowed Wadia’s plea on April 30, 2014 and he deposed in 2016.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/2-acquitted-in-1989-wadia-murder-plot-case/articleshow/98718571.cms,1

NewCo will house the last mile mobility division, including three wheelers (Alfa, Treo, Zor) and four-wheeler small commercial vehicle (Jeeto) and IFC’s financing will help “scale up electric mobility in last mile connectivity - passenger and cargo segments - while enabling the development and manufacturing of new generation products in this space,” M&M said in a statement. IFC’s first investment in an EV manufacturer in the country and the first in electric three-wheelers globally will be in the form of compulsory convertible instruments at a valuation of up to 6,020 crore. The 600 crore investment will result in an ownership of between 9.97% to 13.64% for IFC in NewCo.Anish Shah, MD & CEO, M&M, said, “IFC, with its focus on sustainability and boosting prosperity, is an ideal partner for us. With the electrification of the last mile mobility business at scale, we will move a step further in our commitment to be ‘Planet Positive’ by 2040. ”“With transport being the fastest-growing contributor to climate change, it is no longer a question of whether electric vehicles should be adopted at scale, but rather how quickly,” said Hector Gomez Ang, IFC’s regional director for South Asia.  Transport poses the challenge of heavy reliance on oil imports and severe air pollution. India has committed to reducing its emissions profile by 45% by 2030, and simultaneously aims to achieve 80% EV penetration for two-and three-wheelers, 70% for commercial vehicles, and 30% for private cars. Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director & CEO (auto & farm sector), M&M, said, “The last mile mobility business presents a tremendous opportunity.

The company pla","CHENNAI/NEW DELHI: Indian industrial giant Reliance is reviving a historic local cola brand with plans to use its vast retail network, slash prices and tap nationalist sentiment to challenge US beverage giants PepsiCo and Coca-Cola in a key market.Controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, Reliance this month launched revamped Campa drinks, sugary sodas popular in India in the 1970s and 1980s before disappearing from shelves as the US giants expanded rapidly in a liberalising economy.At first glance it may seem that Ambani will find it tough to loosen Pepsi's and Coca-Cola's stranglehold of a market Euromonitor estimates is worth $4.6 billion and set to grow 5% a year until 2027. Other well known tycoons have tried to go toe-to-toe with the drinks giants, and failed, most notably Richard Branson with his Virgin Cola.But Asia's richest person has famously disrupted India's telecoms market seven years ago with cut-throat pricing to make Reliance the leading player in that industry. And he's applying some of that same strategy in his soft drinks venture.""Coca-Cola and Pepsi are unused to a nationwide challenge, and Reliance has the financial muscle and reach to challenge them with a local brand with high nostalgic value,"" said Amulya Pandit, a consultant at Euromonitor International.A person with direct knowledge of Reliance's plan said it aims to open some factories of its own or as joint ventures to make Campa, and take the soda to hotels, restaurants and in-flight sales. Production of Campa is currently outsourced, after its $2.7 million acquisition of the brand last year.The company is heavily discounting in-store prices. A two-litre Campa Cola bottle is priced at 49 rupees (60 US cents) in stores, a near 50% discount on its label price, and around a third lower than 2.25-litre Coke and Pepsi variants, a Reuters check showed. The smallest bottles of Campa Cola and Coke both cost 10 rupees, while Pepsi starts from 12 rupees.""The price will be disruptive across,"" said the person, who added Reliance is planning an advertising spree during the upcoming popular IPL cricket tournament and is in talks with at least three teams to make Campa their refreshment partner.The person did not want to be identified as the strategy is confidential. Reliance did not respond to a request for comment, while Pepsi said it doesn't comment on competition as a policy.Coca-Cola said it has broadly kept prices of its small bottles unchanged since last year and was focused on expanding distribution. ""Having new players in the market presents a great opportunity for investments to develop the market further,"" it said.Reliance, India's top retailer, will supply Campa to its 2,500 grocery outlets and thousands of smaller non-network stores as part of its new consumer goods push from which it has set an internal target of $6.5 billion in annual revenues within five years.The company also has a grocery shopping app and a wholesale vertical under which it supplies consumer goods to 500,000 mom-and-pop stores, which it will also tap for Campa sales.'Great Indian taste' vs foreign brandsReliance's cola and consumer goods foray is being driven by T. Krishnakumar, an executive who worked for nearly 17 years at Coca-Cola in various leadership roles.Pepsi and Coca-Cola will also cautiously eye Reliance's marketing strategy after it targetted nationalist sentiment and nostalgia by promoting Campa as a homegrown brand with ""Great Indian Taste"" and a ""rich heritage"".A former Pepsi executive who did not want to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the subject said the US firm has always been worried about local products marketed with an ""India First"" agenda, especially at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself backs self-reliance.The rivalry is already playing out in the market.In five Reliance outlets that Reuters visited in Mumbai in India's west, Chennai in the south and Lucknow in the north, Campa cola or lemon plastic bottles were displayed at the main entry gates or placed on shelves just next to the rivals.At one Chennai outlet, a Reliance store manager said this year they were placing Campa at the entrance for promoting it, with rivals tucked behind it and not visible at first glance. Another city store employee said 30 Campa bottles were being sold for every 100 of Pepsi and Coca-Cola.For now, the US rivals have an upper hand. Pepsi and Coca-Cola drinks are available in at least 3 million Indian outlets and the companies have a widespread logistics network, dozens of factories and the advantage of a taste preferred by many, said Alok Shah, a consumer analyst at India's Ambit Capital.""We'll need to wait and watch to see if consumers switch to Campa,"" he said, adding that Pepsi and Coke remain aspirational foreign brands for many Indians, offered at largely similar small-pack prices.Srinivas Rao said he still loves Coca-Cola's Thums Up, a domestic brand it acquired in 1993 and is its best-selling one in India, unlike in the US where Coke dominates.""We buy Thums Up every time we eat biryani or meat at home. We are not drawn to discounts from other brands including Campa,"" Rao said outside a Reliance store in Chennai.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/campa-cola-pepsi-coke-ril-mukesh-ambani/articleshow/98959120.cms,2

India’s transition from traditional gasoline and diesel-fueled transport is expected to lag other regions, whereas China’s adoption of electric vehicles is skyrocketing.While India is unlikely to replicate the mammoth scale of China’s expansive oil network — the nation’s daily crude consumption is triple that of its neighbor — traders and producers looking to tap into diminishing global demand growth will be betting on the South Asian nation into the next decade.“India was always going to exceed China in a matter of time in terms of being the global demand growth driver, mainly due to demographic factors like population growth,” said Parsley Ong, the head of Asia energy and chemicals research at JPMorgan Chase & Co in Hong Kong.China’s economic awakening at the start of the century transformed the nation into a powerhouse consumer of commodities from crude to metals and grains, providing a boost to resource-rich countries across the world. For oil, the end of the boom times is approaching, with top refiner China National Petroleum Corp. recently calling a peak to Chinese oil consumption around 2030.The change of demand growth leader appears even closer.China’s ‘Last Hurrah’Industry veteran Ed Morse, the head of commodities research at Citigroup Inc., says China’s rebound from years of Covid restrictions will likely be the nation’s “last hurrah” for demand. Viktor Katona, the lead crude analyst at data intelligence firm Kpler, reckons India’s growth will surpass China from 2026. He also expects Indian oil demand to peak much later in 2036.“China’s role as a global oil demand growth engine is fading fast,” said Emma Richards, a senior analyst at Fitch Solutions Ltd. in London. Over the next decade, China’s share of total emerging market oil demand growth will slip to 15%, from almost 50%, while India’s share will double to 24%, she said.India is already playing a more prominent role in the oil market following the invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago. The South Asian nation has become a major consumer of Russian crude, turning the OPEC+ producer’s oil into fuels that are often shipped to other regions such as Europe and the US. Indian Oil Demand Set to Keep Growing While China Stalls | Chinese oil demand could peak in the middle of the decade, Citi estimatesIt’s not the first time India has been talked about as the new center of oil demand growth, with similar predictions made in the middle of the last decade. Should it materialize this time, the transition to the top spot will likely be far from smooth and bogged down by bureaucracy.State-run refiners have been slow at modernizing their operations, and still rigidly follow the old and cumbersome process of issuing tenders for spot purchases of oil, rather than taking a more agile and flexible approach of negotiating and signing deals directly with counter-parties.Still, India’s fast-growing crude appetite will position the South Asian nation as an attractive opportunity for overseas traders and producers over the longer term, said Vandana Hari, the founder of Vanda Insights in Singapore.EV BoomIndia has lofty ambitions to transition its industries including transport to greener energy options, but the nation is lagging other major nations, meaning its reliance on fossil fuels is likely to endure for much longer.In contrast, China’s adoption of electric vehicles has been fast, an ominous sign for long-term gasoline demand in the world’s biggest car market. EV sales in China nearly doubled to 6.1 million units in 2022, compared with 48,000 vehicles for India in the same period, according to BloombergNEF.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-set-to-surpass-china-in-need-for-oil-as-growth-paths-diverge/articleshow/98957304.cms,0

Now a new heavyweight has emerged in providing emergency loans to debt-ridden countries: China.New data shows that China is providing ever more emergency loans to countries, including Turkey, Argentina and Sri Lanka. China has been helping countries that have either geopolitical significance, such as a strategic location, or lots of natural resources. Many of them have been borrowing heavily from Beijing for years to pay for infrastructure or other projects.While China is not yet equal to the IMF, it is catching up fast, providing $240bn of emergency financing in recent years. China gave $40.5bn in such loans to distressed countries in 2021, according to a new study by American and European experts who drew on statistics from AidData, a research institute at William and Mary, a university in Williamsburg, Virginia. China provided $10bn in 2014 and none in 2010. medium99051563By comparison, the IMF lent $68.6bn to countries in financial distress in 2021 — a pace that has stayed fairly steady in recent years except for a jump in 2020, at the start of the pandemic.In many ways, China has replaced the United States in bailing out indebted low-and middle-income countries. The U.S. Treasury’s last sizeable rescue loan to a middle-income country was a $1.5bn credit to Uruguay in 2002. The Federal Reserve still provides short-term financing to other industrialised countries when they need extra dollars for a few days or weeks.China’s emerging position as a lender of last resort reflects its evolving status as an economic superpower at a time of global weakness. Dozens of countries are struggling to pay their debts, as a slowing economy and rising interest rates push many nations to the brink.The IMF has also stepped up its own bailouts in recent weeks, in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine and the aftereffects of the pandemic. The IMF reached a preliminary agreement on March 21 to lend $15.6bn to Ukraine, a day after its board approved a $3bn loan to Sri Lanka.Beijing’s new role is also an outgrowth of the decade-old Belt and Road Initiative, the signature project of Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, to develop geopolitical and diplomatic ties through financial and commercial efforts. China has lent $900bn to 151 lower-income countries worldwide, mainly for the construction of highways, bridges, hydroelectric dams and other infrastructure. medium99051710US officials have accused China of engaging in ""debt trap diplomacy” that is saddling countries with excessive debt for construction projects carried out by Chinese companies often using Chinese engineers, Chinese workers and Chinese equipment. Chinese officials contend that they have built much-needed infrastructure that the West talked about for decades but never completed.Unlike many lenders to developing countries, state-controlled financial institutions in China largely doled out loans at adjustable rates. The payments due on many of these loans have doubled in the past year, putting many nations in a difficult financial spot. China, for its part, blames the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, for putting pressure on countries by pushing up interest rates.China’s central bank is extending the separate, emergency loans at fairly high interest rates to Laos, Pakistan, Nigeria, Suriname and other financially distressed countries. China’s state-owned banks face losses if Beijing does not bail out their borrowers but may profit if other countries manage to stay current on their debt payments.China charges somewhat high interest rates for emergency credit to middle-income countries in distress, typically 5%. That compares with 2% for loans from the IMF, the new study found.The US Treasury charged almost the same interest rate as China — 4.8% — when it made rescue loans to middle-income countries in the 1990s through 2002. The Fed has recently been charging about 1% for its short-term loans to other industrialised countries.China’s emergency lending has gone almost entirely to middle-income countries that owe a lot of money to state-controlled Chinese banks. More than 90% of China’s emergency loans in 2021 were in its own currency, the renminbi.It is not unusual for a country to use its own currency in international rescues. The dollar displaced European currencies in the borrowing of many developing countries after the United States played a central role in resolving the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s.In lending renminbi, Beijing is furthering its efforts to limit reliance on the US dollar as the go-to global currency. When borrowing renminbi from China’s central bank using so-called swap agreements, the indebted countries then keep the renminbi in their central reserves while spending their dollars to repay foreign debts.Some countries, such as Mongolia, now hold much of their currency reserves in renminbi, after previously holding them mainly in dollars, said Brad Parks, executive director of AidData and an author of the study.Such financial moves tether countries more closely to China, since the renminbi is hard to spend except to buy Chinese goods and services. In their meeting last week, Xi and President Vladimir Putin of Russia agreed that more of their countries’ trade and other commercial ties will be connected to the renminbi.Foreign minister Qin Gang of China has strongly defended his country’s debt record, noting that China allowed dozens of the world’s poorest countries to delay debt repayments in 2020 and 2021.“China has suspended more debt service payments than any other Group of 20 member,” he said in a March 2 speech at a gathering of foreign ministers of the large G20 countries.As China increasingly steps into the role of emergency lender and its own economy slows, it is also reassessing its broader lending program. More recently, it has begun pulling back from infrastructure loans. According to data from China’s ministry of commerce, the annual value of completed contracts in Belt and Road Initiative countries fell to $85bn last year, from a peak of $98bn in 2019.“We are seeing the emergence of another big financial rescue player in the international financial system,” as the cost of Belt and Road Initiative loans becomes clear, said Christoph Trebesch, research director for international finance and macroeconomics at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany and an author of the study.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/after-doling-out-huge-loans-china-is-now-bailing-out-countries/articleshow/99051462.cms,1

Russia backed the voluntary cuts by extending planned reduction in output.The International Energy Agency last month said global oil demand could rise to over 103 million barrels a day, up 2.2 million barrels from current levels. Clearly then, the latest production cuts will keep prices elevated, with most analysts suggesting $80-90 per barrel and some brokerages even rooting for $100.OPEC lynchpin Saudi Arabia described the move as a measure to ensure oil market stability. Market watchers saw a bigger play in geopolitics and the recent strain in relations between Washington and Riyadh over president Joe Biden pushing for higher volumes from OPEC to reduce prices further and his administration’s public iteration that the US was in no hurry to fill the strategic petroleum reserve.As a country that meets 85% of oil need through imports, India is vulnerable to any volatility in oil prices. So for fuel consumers in India, the cuts could not have come at a worse time. The recent drop in oil prices had turned petrol and diesel profitable for retailers, who were earlier suffering losses because of the freeze on pump prices amid elevated crude.In a sign of improved margins, private sector retailer such as Reliance Industries Ltd recently pared its prices to match state-run companies. This set off a buzz that a reduction in fuel prices was round the corner since private retailers charged more than state retailers to minimise the under recovery. But with oil near $85 per barrel, a price cut looks improbable.For the Centre, flaring oil will fuel inflationary pressure on the economy. Prashant Vasisht of ICRA said higher oil prices increase the import bill and weakens the rupee against the dollar, impacting current account deficit. They also raise LPG subsidy bill and manufacturing cost. On the upside, oil producers will benefit from higher profits and cash accruals, which will lead to higher windfall gains tax yield for the Centre.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/opec-move-dashes-hopes-of-fuel-price-cut-revives-inflation-fears/articleshow/99221958.cms,0

The Reliance Brands management has alleged that the former executive, a resident of Gurgaon, stole data from the office’s computer and sent it to his personal email ID in April last year. The data contained annual operating plans of a partner firm from 2022 to 2027, said the complainant, Reliance Brands financial manager Sanjeev Vashista.Neither Agarwalla nor Vashista could be reached for comment on Wednesday evening. According to the complaint, the executive joined the company on July 13, 2021 and was managing three prominent brands that have a partnership with Reliance Brands.“During the course of his employment with the company, the accused was involved in sending internal strategic documents of the Mothercare brand to his personal email address. Taking undue advantage of his position, the accused engineered a way to misuse the trust and resources bestowed upon him as the CFO of the business of the company,” the complaint read.The complaint stated Reliance Brands was alerted about the email on April 28, 2022, a few days after the Agarwalla allegedly forwarded the document.  “Our internal risk management team on April 28, 2022, highlighted that on April 25, 2022, the accused had exported an excel file containing an annual operating plan for the business. It contained activities that the company was planning to undertake and financial details of the business for the current financial 2022-2023 and the upcoming financial years till 2026-2027,” the FIR reads.The company told TOI it took a year to conduct an internal inquiry. “Owing to our robust systems, we were able to promptly detect the fraudulent activity and effectively mitigate its potential impact. This individual was still an employee when this incident took place, following which we terminated his services,” a company spokesperson said at n Wednesday. The firm said it has submitted Agarwalla’s statement to police for further investigation.“The accused will be contacted soon. Action will be taken after proper investigation,” said Jasvir, SHO at cyber crime police station. .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/former-cfo-at-reliance-brands-booked-for-stealing-firm-data/articleshow/99282465.cms,1

Lula wants Brazil, China and other nations to help mediate the war as part of his nation's return to the world stage, but his proposals to end the conflict have irked Ukraine and some in the West. Less controversial is the Brazilian and Chinese mutual interest in trade after a rocky period under Lula's predecessor.  China and Brazil are expected to sign at least 20 bilateral agreements during Lula's two-day stay, according to the Brazilian government. Lula plans to visit Shanghai and Beijing, and meet with his counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday. The two leaders are expected to discuss trade, investment, reindustrialization, energy transition, climate change and peace agreements, the Brazilian government said. China is Brazil's biggest export market, each year buying tens of billions of dollars worth of soybeans, beef, iron ore, poultry, pulp, sugar cane, cotton and crude oil. Brazil is the biggest recipient of Chinese investment in Latin America, according to Chinese state media. Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and members of his family at times caused friction with Chinese authorities during his 2019-2022 term. In 2020, when Bolsonaro's lawmaker son Eduardo blamed the COVID-19 pandemic on the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese ambassador to Brazil called his words ""an evil insult against China and the Chinese people."" Later that year, Eduardo referred to the giant Chinese technology company Huawei as ""Chinese espionage,"" prompting a sharp rebuke from China's embassy. Last year, China did not have an ambassador in Brasilia for eight months. The rift stoked criticism in Brazil, even among sectors that supported Bolsonaro, like agribusiness.  ""I want the Chinese to understand that their investment here will be wonderfully welcome, but not to buy our companies. To build new things, which we need,"" Lula told journalists in Brasilia on April 6. Chinese companies are involved in public works projects in Brazil, including a metro line in Sao Paulo, the country's business capital. One of the agreements Lula will sign in China will be for construction of the sixth satellite built under a binational program, a satellite that would monitor biomes such as the Amazon rainforest. ""Brazil can't afford to turn its back on the benefits China brings. The US doesn't have the capacity to absorb Brazil's exports as China does, nor occupy the same space in investment and infrastructure,"" said Pedro Brites, an expert on China at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university and think tank in Sao Paulo. And China is encouraging its companies to find new markets and foreign partners to reduce reliance on the US ""Lula knows you have to treat your clients well. Even more so when it is your best client,"" said Charles Tang, who chairs the Brazil-China Chamber of Commerce. In what Tang suggested was the result of a renewed partnership, China ended restrictions on Brazilian beef just before Lula was initially scheduled to make his trip. Sales of Brazilian beef to China were banned in February following the discovery of an atypical case of mad cow disease. Lula's visit to China, initially scheduled for March but canceled after he fell sick, is also an attempt by the leftist leader to reaffirm Brazil's role on the global stage following Bolsonaro's term, who admired right-wing nationalists and showed little interest in international affairs or travel abroad. Lula visited Argentina and Uruguay in January and the US in February, signaling the importance he gives to international affairs, experts said. He toured the world during his first presidency, particularly in his second term, when he visited dozens of countries, and has visited China twice before. ""Lula is implementing the promise he made that Brazil is back,"" said Oliver Stuenkel, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation.  China and Brazil are members of the BRICS group of developing countries and have pushed for changes in what they say is a US-dominated system of managing global political affairs.  Russia is also a BRICS member, and a key piece of Lula's outreach abroad is his proposal that Brazil and other developing countries, including China, mediate peace. Lula has irritated Ukraine and some in the West with his position on the war, most recently by suggesting during a meeting with journalists in Brasilia last week that Ukraine cede Crimea as a means to forge peace. Xi met with Putin last month, sending a message to US and European leaders that their condemnation of Russia's invasion is not unanimous. Earlier this month, a Lula adviser, former foreign affairs minister Celso Amorim, took a discreet trip to Moscow, where he met with President Vladimir Putin. Amorim ""went to listen and to say the time has come to talk,"" Brazilian foreign minister Mauro Vieira told reporters in the capital, Brasilia, on April 5. There is at least some common ground. Vieira noted that the Chinese peace proposal presented in February contains aspects in common with Lula's, such as ceasing hostilities and starting negotiations. ""These are completely plausible and may be stimulus for talks,"" he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/brazils-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-visits-china-seeking-ties-and-ukraine-support/articleshow/99425052.cms,0

It is planning to sell stake in Afcons Infrastructure, a company acquired from ICICI Bank, and Gopalpur Ports, also an acquired asset from metal trader Sara International and entrepreneur Mahimananda Mishra of Orissa Stevedores. It is also considering selling part of its interests in real estate assets with a development size of over 100 million square feet. The asset-monetisation proceeds will be used to reduce its debt of Rs 21,000 crore and for other purposes. SP Group refused to comment. Many years ago, it had looked to list Afcons Infrastructure on the Indian stock exchanges. Despite getting regulatory approvals, the proposal was shelved. The group, led by Shapoor Mistry, has revived plans to sell Gopalpur Ports as the business environment has improved. Cargo movement at the port was impacted after India imposed export duty on certain commodities like iron ore. This tax was subsequently eliminated.The over $4-billion group — which built the Sultan of Oman’s palace and the Atal tunnel, the world’s longest highway tunnel above 10,000 feet — has been weighing various fund-raising options to improve leverage metrics as rising interest rates add to its challenges. It had divested the water purifier maker Eureka Forbes, the Jammu-Udhampur highway asset, Forbes Facility Services and Sterling & Wilson Renewable Energy to reduce loan obligations. Additionally, the 158-year-old group had raised $1.3 billion by pledging half of its 18.37% stake in Tata Sons with Farallon Capital and Ares SSG Capital. These moves helped SP to exit RBI’s Covid debt-restructuring scheme that entailed no haircut to lenders ahead of the timeline. SP and related parties still own 33% in Sterling & Wilson Renewable, which they plan to exit in the future. Majority owned by Reliance Industries, the renewable company has a market cap of Rs 7,000 crore.Apart from the fresh asset sale plans, SP is also raising $1.75 billion from pledging its remaining Tata Sons stake.

The profit beat estimates driven by a strong performance across businesses.  Gross revenue from operations of India's most valued company came in at Rs 2.39 lakh crore, registering a year-on-year rise of 2.8 percent.  The bottom line of the Mukesh Ambani-led company was expected to grow in single digits year-on-year (YoY). Analysts estimated Reliance Industries  to post an average net profit of Rs 16,573 crore.  EBITDA increased by 21.8 percent year on year (YoY) to Rs 41,389 crore on account of higher revenue and increase in margins in the digital services segment, the company said in a release.  Sourcing benefits and operating efficiencies in the retail segment also helped. Higher transportation fuel cracks and optimised feedstock cost were partially offset by lower downstream chemical margins in Oil-to-Chemicals (O2C) segment.  “O2C segment posted its highest-ever operating profit despite global uncertainties and disruptions in commodity trade flows. Our oil and gas segment also delivered very strong growth and is now poised to contribute nearly 30 percent of India’s domestic gas production,” said Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries.  RIL also witnessed better gas price realization and higher volumes in the oil and gas segment.  “I am happy to note Reliance’s initiatives in digital connectivity and organized retail are driving greater efficiencies in the economy and contributing to India’s emergence as one of the fastest growing economies in the world,” said Ambani.  “This year we have proposed to demerge our financial services arm and list the new entity “Jio Financial Services Ltd. This gives our shareholders an opportunity to participate in an exciting new growth platform from inception.”  Capital expenditure in FY23 was at Rs 1.41 lakh crore, and net debt as of 31st March 2023 stood at Rs 1.10 lakh crore. Venkatachari Srikanth, chief financial officer for the company, said the increase in net debt was due to working capital and translation impact on foreign currency liabilities. He further added that internal accruals would continue to fund the company’s growth plans, as seen over the last two years, where cash profits had covered 98 percent of the capital expenditure. “The emphasis remains on discipline in capital allocation to support growth initiatives. We believe that it will be largely funded through internal accruals,” he said.  Jio Platforms  Jio Platforms' profit for the quarter came in at Rs 4,984 crore, up 15.6 percent. Revenue from operations for the company, which houses Reliance's telecom and streaming businesses, increased 14.4 percent YoY to Rs 25,465 crore.  Revenue from operations increased primarily driven by a sustained increase in subscriber base for the connectivity business while strong EBITDA growth was led by higher revenue and increase in margins.  Average revenue per user (ARPU), an important metric to measure the performance of telecom companies, also improved 6.7 percent YoY to Rs 178.8 per user per month. Quarter on quarter it improved by 60 paise per user.  &quot;Jio has taken formidable strides in pioneering 5G rollout across the country with unmatched speed of execution,&quot; said Akash M Ambani, chairman, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited.  This has led to a significant improvement in customer experience, reflected in the higher engagement levels among Jio users. &quot;Jio remains committed to build a robust digital society with tailormade technology platforms which will drive sustained growth in earning and value for all stakeholders,&quot; he added.

The bottom line grew by 12.9 percent YoY to Rs 2,415 crore while revenue from operations stood at Rs 61,559 crore, up 21.1 percent YoY. Store footfalls was at 219 million, the highest ever, up from 201 million in Q3FY23.  RIL said the business continued to invest in strengthening its supply chain capabilities by expanding over 1.7 million sq. ft. of warehouse space. Digital Commerce and New Commerce contributed to 17 percent of revenue.  &quot;In last 10 years, we have allocated capital to consumer-centric businesses which has transformed the earning mix and positioned us as a consumer and tech company,&quot; Srikanth said.  The company said focus will remain on expanding distribution reach across geographies for this segment.  Also Read: Reliance Retail Q4: Net profit up 13% at Rs 2,415 crore on highest ever footfalls  O2C  Revenue for the O2C business fell by 11.8 percent YoY to Rs 1,28,633 crore. Exports dropped 0.4 percent to Rs 78,851 crore. EBITDA, meanwhile, improved 14.4 percent to Rs 16,293 crore.  EBITDA margin was at 12.7 percent, an increase of 290 bps YoY led by strength in transportation fuel cracks, optimized feedstock cost and advantageous ethane cracking economics. This was partially offset by lower polyester chain margins. Special additional excise duty on transportation fuels adversely impacted earnings by Rs 711 crore. The full year impact of special additional excise duty on transportation fuels on earnings was at Rs 6,648 crore.  Commenting on the O2C business' full-year performance, Srikanth said the vertical had benefited strong global oil demand. “We had a better margin capture and also superior product placement. Higher fuel cracks offset weak downstream margins,” he said.  The O2C business includes refining, petrochemicals, fuel retailing through Reliance BP Mobility Limited, aviation fuel and bulk wholesale marketing.  Oil &amp;amp; Gas  Oil &amp;amp; Gas revenue more than doubled to Rs 4,556 crore as compared to Q4FY22, mainly on account of higher price realisation and 13 percent increase in KGD6 gas production. The average price realised for KGD6 was at $11.39 /MMBTU in the March quarter, against $6.13 / MMBTU a year ago. MMBTU is Metric Million British Thermal Unit. KGD6 gas production likely to increase to 30 mmscmd in FY24 with commissioning of MJ field, where testing and commissioning is underway.  EBITDA increased sharply to Rs 3,801 crore, which was up almost 2.5x on YoY basis. EBITDA margin was at 83.4 percent for Q4FY23 up by about 60 bps as compared to Q4FY22.  The company expects the gas market environment in India to remain positive in the medium term, while global gas price are likely to remain volatile with demand uncertainties and higher EU storage.  In the current financial quarter, Reliance Industries said it has sold the entire volume of 6 MMSCMD in an e-auction held on April 12 and the Gas sale purchase agreement (GSPA) is under execution with successful bidders.  Media  RIL's media business reported a loss of 35 crore for the quarter. Revenue fell 8.5 percent to Rs 1,484 crore.  TV News segment grew, driven by the growth in advertising revenue. Excluding movie production segment which has project-based volatility, revenue was marginally up with growth across all verticals, RIL said.  TV News reported a sharp QoQ improvement in EBITDA and margins. Consolidated EBITDA was down primarily due to Viacom18’s investments in new initiatives (Sports and Digital verticals had an impact of Rs 170 crore on EBITDA) and a lag in recovery of ad revenues.

The company has already been offering a solution to curb spam calling.“We have built a solution to respond to (SMS frauds) and to safeguard our users and we'd be happy to work with both the regulator and carriers on this side. In fact, we are in conversations with them,” Nami Zarringhalam, chief strategy officer and co-founder of Truecaller told ET.When specifically asked if the company is in talks with all the three operators, he said, “Not all three are on the same table, but all three separately.”The telecom and financial regulators in India are working overtime to curb phishing and financial scams. In fact, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has asked all the telecom operators to showcase their anti-phishing solutions. So far, Vodafone Idea has demonstrated its solution in partnership with Tanla Solutions while Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel are expected to do so by next month.“I think what is really positive is that this area (spam and frauds) has gotten the attention with Trai confirming that this is an issue, and it is causing harm to people. There are so many stories about people, for instance, senior citizens, who lost their savings by being defrauded and then the kind of shame and guilt that they might feel on an emotional level,” Zarringhalam said.He added that Truecaller is using AI technology for messaging and calling to check spam and frauds and through these innovations, the solution is always one step ahead of where the scammers and fraudsters are heading.As per estimates, India ranks among the largest markets for SMS phishing, with over six million citizens scammed annually, resulting in an estimated loss of around Rs 15,000 crore. The country’s growing mobile user base and low SMS rates have led to SMS phishing becoming one of the most prevalent forms of scam, say experts.Truecaller also rebutted privacy fears around Trai’s consultation on calling name presentation (CNAP) in telecommunication networks. “This is a welcome step by Trai as they are looking at this problem and seeing that it is an issue in society that we should try to address,” he said.India is the biggest market for Truecaller and the company is very bullish about the India opportunity.

Television series are set to premiere on JioCinema on the same day as the U.S.,"" the companies said.Clement Schwebig, President for India, Southeast Asia and Korea for Warner Bros, said the agreement was part of its commitment to the South Asia market, as the company looks to further strengthen the scale of its regional business.One source told Reuters that the partnership would be exclusive and see most of Warner's marquee content on the JioCinema platform. Warner cannot offer most of its popular titles to other Indian rivals including Amazon Prime Video and Disney Hotstar, the source added.""It's a deep exclusive arrangement which will make JioCinema the house of Warner, HBO in India,"" the source said.The content deal will bring thousands of hours of streaming content onto JioCinema, which has become popular for showing the IPL cricket tournament on the platform for free in the ongoing season.Viacom18 won the IPL digital streaming rights from 2023 to 2027 for around $2.9 billion, rights which Disney previously held. Viacom18's shareholders include Reliance, Paramount Global as well as Bodhi Tree, which is a joint venture between James Murdoch and a former Star India executive, Uday Shankar.Bodhi Tree recently invested $528 million in Viacom18.Several of HBO's top rated shows, including Succession, had aired in India on the Disney Hotstar platform until March 31 as part of a deal between the two companies that ended on the date.The source told Reuters that Warner so far had various arrangements with Indian streaming giants, but the Viacom-Warner deal will see consolidation of that library and will include HBO, Max and Warner content, among others.JioCinema is seeking to compete with rivals including Netflix and Amazon in a market where such platforms are becoming increasingly popular, thanks to cheap data prices.""These marquee deals from IPL to HBO are great for not only user acquisition but also for stickiness and mind share,"" said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research.For now, JioCinema is a small player.

The proportion of contract workers in tech roles within the non-tech sector is expected to rise from the current 20% to around 26% by the end of FY 2027, indicating an increasing reliance on temporary or contract-based tech professionals.

The counsel placed reliance upon the judgments of the Supreme Court in the State of Punjab vs Rafiq Masih and others and Thomas Daniel vs the State of Kerala and others to buttress his submission.On the other hand, counsel for the state government, Ravi Bhagat, submitted that prior to the date of retirement, an undertaking was given by the petitioner to the effect that if any excess payment was paid to him, the same shall be adjusted from his salary. He placed reliance on the matter of the high court of Punjab and Haryana and others vs Jagdev Singh and submitted that the order of recovery is valid, and the excess amount given to the petitioner can be recovered.The court said that there is no provision in the Chhattisgarh Pay Revision Rules to take an undertaking from any government servant. Therefore, the judgment passed in the case of Jagdev Singh, placed by the state counsel, is distinguishable from the facts of the present case.The court observed that the order of recovery of excess payment has been raised after 19 years before one month of the petitioner’s retirement. There was no misrepresentation on the part of the petitioner, who was not even granted an opportunity for a hearing. The respondents did not conduct an inquiry before passing the order. With these observations, the high court quashed the BEO's order and asked to refund the amount recovered from the petitioner within a period of two months from the date of receipt of the copy of this order, and the amount shall carry a 6% interest per annum from the date of recovery till its refund.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/hc-quashes-state-govt-order-for-recovery-from-headmaster/articleshow/100000121.cms,2

India launched a call for submissions,"NEW DELHI: India is set to revive its effort to lure prospective chipmakers into the country as projects already disclosed, including billionaire Anil Agarwal’s $19 billion plan, are taking time to get off the ground.New Delhi plans to reopen the application process for $10 billion in incentives and assistance intended to encourage local chipmaking, people familiar with the matter said. It’s also keeping the process open-ended, doing away with a previous 45-day requirement for submission, they said, asking not to be named as the discussions aren’t public. That’s after an initial effort launched last year only attracted three applicants — all of which have made little progress so far.India is joining countries including the US in trying to boost chip output to reduce reliance on expensive imports and dependence on Taiwan and China. The effort has yet to result in any large global chip player moving base to the South Asian nation, underscoring the major challenge supply chain shifts involve.To kick-start a domestic chip industry, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government originally gave companies just 45 days, beginning January 1, 2022, to apply for fiscal support. The state pledged to fund as much as half the cost of building a chip fabrication plant. But the short window led to just a few applicants including a partnership between Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources Ltd and Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, and a consortium that includes Tower Semiconductor Ltd.India now plans to allow companies to apply again and is set to accept applications until its budgeted $10 billion in incentives is exhausted, the people said. That means the Vedanta and Tower groups might not be the only ones racing to win federal support for chip plants. India’s salt-to-software Tata conglomerate has publicly voiced its ambitions to get into chipmaking.India’s technology ministry didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.Semiconductor production is an uphill task for metals and mining group Vedanta and its iPhone maker partner Hon Hai — neither has significant experience in manufacturing chips. Separately, Vedanta is also reeling under a heavy debt burden, which means Agarwal’s dream to build a chip plant hinges on government aid. The company is just weeks away from winning an in-principle or preliminary government nod, but ultimately obtaining the state funding requires further difficult steps, the people said.Any chip project, including Vedanta’s, will have to make detailed disclosures including whether it has firm, binding agreements with a technology partner for production, as well as financing plans comprising equity and debt arrangements. The applicants also need to disclose the type of semiconductors they’ll make and their target customers. To qualify for the full 50% state support, a company needs to make chips using the relatively sophisticated 28-nanometer or more advanced technology.In a statement, David Reed, chief executive officer of Vedanta’s semiconductor business, said the project is “on track,” with the venture breaking ground on a site in the fourth quarter of this year and earning revenue in the first half of 2027. He said partner Hon Hai, also known as Foxconn, has secured “production grade, high volume 40-nanometer technology” for the venture as well as “development grade 28-nanometer technology,” without disclosing where the tech is coming from.“Foxconn and Vedanta are following the application process issued by the Indian government with confidence and partnership,” Reed said. “We have supplied all relevant information and eagerly wait for the final approval.”Vedanta has been in talks with GlobalFoundries Inc. and STMicroelectronics NV to license chip fabrication technology, Bloomberg News reported previously. But Agarwal’s group is yet to name a tech partner. Also, the government considers Vedanta’s capital expenditure estimate of $10 billion inflated, people familiar with the matter have told Bloomberg News, but the company has said it is on par with other similar projects.Separately, another chipmaking plan — a $3 billion investment for a fabrication unit in southern Karnataka state — stands stalled as the consortium technology partner Tower Semiconductor awaits guidance from new parent Intel Corp., which is working to complete the acquisition.Vedanta’s difficulties underscore how hard it is to set up new semiconductor plants, massive complexes that cost billions to construct and require very specialized expertise to run. Such facilities also rely on a large network of suppliers of everything from chemicals and machinery to electronic components, which hasn’t fully developed in India.Meanwhile India’s consumption of chips is rising as electronics manufacturers are relocating assembly operations to the country to reduce reliance on China. India’s chip market is set to reach about $64 billion in 2026, triple what it was in 2019, according to Counterpoint Research.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-to-reopen-application-process-for-10-billion-in-chip-incentives/articleshow/100117895.cms,2

Suffice it to say that the view taken by the arbitral tribunal is most certainly a 'possible view', which calls for no interference... ... this court finds no ground to interfere with the majority arbitral award; which is accordingly upheld,"" justice Anup Jairam Bhambani said in his judgement.The oil ministry had approached the Delhi High Court after an international arbitration tribunal struck down its demand for about $1.6 billion in cost, including interest, and $175 million as additional cumulative profit petroleum payable till March 31, 2016 towards ""disgorgement of unjust enrichment"" made by RIL.100114725The case dates back to 2013 when ONGC stirred the hornet's nest by claiming its IG and KG-DWN-98/2 blocks adjacent to RIL's KG-D6 field shared a common gas pool. ONGC further said RIL, which had already put KG-D6 into operation, was extracting gas that migrated from its blocks that were under development and moved the court.Once US consultant DeGolyer & MacNaughton (D&M), appointed under court order for an independent study, affirmed the continuity of the gas pool, the ministry appointed a one-man committee of retired Delhi HC chief justice A P Shah to suggest a course of action.The committee said RIL had made ""unfair"" enrichment and was liable to pay. The ministry then slapped costs on RIL, which challenged it through international arbitration. The arbitration panel rejected the government's charges and asked the Centre to pay legal costs to RIL. The government challenged this in the court.The court upheld the arbitration tribunal's rejection of the government's allegation of unfair enrichment by RIL. ""In the opinion of this court, firstly, the aforesaid inferences are factual conclusions arrived at by the arbitral tribunal, which cannot be second-guessed by this court... Secondly, in the opinion of this court, the factual conclusions are perfectly rational, coherent and logical, especially considering what was comprised in the PSC (production sharing contract) was a purely commercial transaction entered into by two contracting parties,"" the court said.The tribunal had said ""RIL extracted whatever gas became available in the course of petroleum operations within their contract area. Reliance deducted the 'cost petroleum', calculated the 'profit petroleum' and shared the requisite portion of the profit petroleum with the ministry. The Ministry has not alleged that Reliance did not pay them their share of profit petroleum for the entire quantity of gas extracted by Reliance, including migrated gas.""On the allegation of RIL committing fraud by suppressing knowledge about the continuity of the gas pool, the tribunal had said ""non-disclosure of one solitary D&M Report-2003, though a technical breach of terms of the PSC, was not a material breach of the contract. The arbitral tribunal also holds that the ministry would not have ordered unit-development. The arbitral tribunal holds that the ministry was not deprived of the benefits of Reliance producing gas from the contract area.""

The move comes at a time when mobile operators are expanding 5G networks while activities around Digital India and electronics manufacturing gathering pace. Robbins has been in India since May 7, and met Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, foreign minister S Jaishankar, and minister of state for IT & electronics Rajeev Chandrasekhar. “Cisco sees India as a growth opportunity over the decade,” he said, while talking about getting manufacturing operations in the country that will cater not only to the needs of the local market but also exports with sourcing opportunities even to Europe.100145121 Cisco had previously launched manufacturing in India that was focused on domestic market, but this had to be called off due to lack of consistent demand and a supporting ecosystem. This time, the company aims to build an ecosystem of local suppliers. “We are announcing strategic investments in Indian manufacturing capabilities as the next step in delivering cutting­edge technologies to our customers here and across the globe.” Robbins said that the growth of telecom and digital in India is prompting it to invest more. “Fuelled by a rapidly developing digital economy, India is a focal point of innovation and business for Cisco, and we remain deeply committed to our partnerships here.” Company officials said that Tamil Nadu will be the location for manufacturing operations, which will focus on developing a robust supplier ecosystem. Cisco will be building core manufacturing capabilities, including testing, development and logistics, and expand in­house repair operations. The company aims to drive more than $1 billion in combined domestic production and exports over the coming years, Robbins said. “There is amomentum here that wasn’t there earlier. There is ambition that exists in this country, and the pace of growth is impressive given what is happening around the world.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-has-growth-opportunity-cisco/articleshow/100145017.cms,0

Revenue and profit increased to Rs 1.9 lakh crore and Rs 10,471 crore in FY23 from Rs 7,292 crore and Rs 471 crore in 1999, respectively. Naik also managed to fend off takeover attempts by Reliance Industries and Aditya Birla Group in the early 2000s and conceptualised L&T Employee Trust by ringfencing the company from future takeover attempts. He also led L&T into new businesses including defence and IT services. A source said, while Naik is very agile mentally, he has his ups and downs physically as people his age would have. He wanted to cut down his assignments and focus on matters close to his heart, like philanthropy, and this (stepping down) is a part of succession planning, the source added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/naik-hands-over-lts-reins-to-subrahmanyan/articleshow/100144901.cms,2

It was installed in Fatehgunj and the circle itself came to be popularly called Vad Circle.However, there was a controversy regarding the sculpture in 2015 when a flyover was being constructed over it. It was eventually shifted to its present location at Chhani Jakatnaka Circle.Sources said that till last year, the Chhani Jakatnaka circle’s landscaping and other maintenance was being done regularly by Reliance Industries Ltd. However, the VMC came up with the policy of inviting offers from persons willing to take up circles in the city and the civic body took possession of the Vad circle.Till now, the VMC has not been able to zero down on a firm to maintain the circle.VMC executive engineer Rajesh Chauhan said that VMC was looking to charge royalty from companies that take up circles and were inviting offers. He said two offers had been received for Jakatnaka Circle and that VMC would select one soon.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/chhanis-iconic-vad-sculpture-obscured-by-wild-vegetation/articleshow/100173890.cms,2

With consumers becoming more discerning, demanding, open to experimentation, there’s enough and more headroom to grow.""The share of beauty in the $ 17 billion local beauty and personal care (BPC) market is under 20%"", said Rishav Jain, managing director at Alvarez & Marsal India.Mumbai-based Tanni Mandal feels India needs more offline beauty stores, New Delhi’s Tanya Aggarwal still can’t find adequate choice of concealers in the market while Dharamshala’s Vaishali Dhiman wishes to see more brands that can cater to different skin tones. This probably explains why big conglomerates like Reliance Industries and the Tata Group have their eyes set on the beauty space. “By 2030, the size of the BPC market is expected to double. From a size and growth perspective, it’s a good category to be in for companies which want scale,” said Anand Ramanathan, partner at Deloitte India.In strict industry terms, beauty includes colour cosmetics, make-up products, fragrances and parts of men’s grooming items. Skincare and body care products are usually categorised as personal care although such rigid segmentation is hardly adhered to in regular practice. Angshuman Bhattacharya, partner and national leader, consumer product and retail sector at EY India said that several segments even in face care and body care have less than 35% of household penetration.While announcing the launch of its tech backed omni-channel beauty platform Tira earlier this month, Reliance Retail Ventures’ executive director Isha Ambani made the company’s ambitions in the space clear: “We aim to break down barriers in the beauty space and democratise beauty for consumers across segments.” The Tata Group which runs a standalone online beauty platform Tata CLiQ Palette wants to go equally aggressive on the market. “The beauty industry is expected to grow at a double digit CAGR for the next 5-10 years and our aim is to revolutionise the space by becoming India’s largest tech-enabled beauty destination,” said a spokesperson at Tata CLiQ Palette. Both the firms offer a mix of home-grown and global brands.And their ambitions have legs. With the increasing participation of women in the workforce, the added touch of glamour to the corporate culture with the entry of startups, the basket of occasion for beauty consumption has broadened, triggering demand for a wider product range. Besides, Gen Z and millennials who make up a significant portion of the earning population have taken to consumption of products that promise clean beauty, use natural ingredients and eco-friendly packaging. Green beauty is in vogue; as Mumbaikar Divya Jethi said: “people are becoming aware of the harmful chemicals like parabens and sulfates.” In other words, companies will have to step up innovation. “Consumers want variety. For that companies will have to build a wide portfolio and add depth to the range for the business models to become viable. The young people are seeking cruelty free beauty products with no animal testing. All of these require capital and can only be catered to by big players,” said Ramanathan. Micro-trends such as naturals, functional ingredients, sustainability and organic are driving premiumisation and specialisation, making BPC one of the most attractive FMCG segments, said Bhattacharya.The entry of big players will also lead to organised retailing. The beauty market in the small towns is very unorganised with customers still dependent on unbranded stores for purchases. E-commerce has sure helped but beauty as a category often requires the element of touch and feel. “There are only about 80,000-100,000 beauty stores across India. As new players enter the market, availability of products will get better not just in metros, but in the small towns, leading to higher adoption,” said Jain who estimates that the adoption of beauty is going to increase by 14%-15% CAGR over the next few years. With the supply of contract manufacturers getting augmented, developing private labels will not be difficult for companies either, said Neelesh Hundekari, head of fashion and luxury, APAC at Kearney.

As the subscriber base approaches 500 million (currently it is 433 million) and market share reaches 50 per cent, the brokerage had studied the evolving market structure with the viability of ""Vodafone Idea under question"", price repair and potential IPO plans.The brokerage cited four reasons - on the basis of market structure, pricing repair, revival of Vodafone-Idea remains challenging and Jio Strategic investors - why it thought Jio, which is on the path to 500 million subscribers, is the undisputed scale player in Indian telecom.On the lines of market structure, the Indian telecom market has changed significantly from 12 players five years ago to three key private players currently, it said.The market continues to consolidate with Jio and Bharti having 80 per cent share and Vodafone-Idea ""losing share"".""We expect further consolidation by FY26 with Jio subscribers' share to reach 48 per cent (496 million) and revenue share of 47 per cent,"" it added.On pricing repair, it said price war by Jio in 2016 led to collapse of pricing by 95 per cent and reduced average revenue per user (ARPU) for competition by 50 per cent over 2016-2019. Tariff hikes, between 25-30 per cent, starting December 2019 marked a period of pricing discipline for the sector. ""While near time tariff hike likely to get pushed out, we expect Jio ARPU to reach Rs 225 by FY26 driven by 5G monetisation,"" it added.On the lines of the revival of Vodafone-Idea (VI) remains challenging,It said market share losses of Vodafone-Idea (VI) continue to be driven ""by low network investments and delay in fund raise"".VI has lost 15 per cent market share (~190 million subscribers) since June-2016. The company has to service Rs 88 bn in the next 12 months. ""Total net debt at Rs 2.2 Tn with the company requiring tariff hikes to service debt repayments,"" it added.On Jio strategic investors, the brokerage said in 2020, international investors invested USD 20 billion for a 33 per cent stake.This includes strategic investors (Meta, Google) of 18 per cent and private equity investors namely Vista, KKR, Silverlake, PIF etc, of 15 per cent. ""Typical private equity (PE) holding period being four years, we expect some investors to look for an exit (more details likely in AGM in June/July) Investment Implications,"" it added.More details are likely to surface in annual general meeting (AGM) in June/July, according to Berstein.

While state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) continue to hold prices despite a drop in international rates, private fuel retailers have started passing on the benefit to consumers.  &quot;To further stimulate domestic consumption and cater to local customers better, we have introduced a Re 1 discount in our retail outlets until the end of June 2023,&quot; a spokesperson for Nayara Energy said.  &quot;We believe in being a strong partner to India's energy needs and will continue to serve the country's consumption demand.&quot; Nayara Energy, which owns over 7 per cent of India's 86,925 petrol pumps, is selling petrol and diesel at Re 1 per litre less than that by IOC, BPCL and HPCL in 10 states such as Maharashtra and Rajasthan.  Earlier this month, Jio-bp, the retail fuel joint venture of Reliance and bp, started selling superior grade diesel at Re 1 per litre cheaper than normal or regular grade diesel sold by state-owned companies.  The additive-enhanced diesel helps clean dirt deposits in engines and can improve fuel efficiency.  While Reliance-bp has priced only diesel less than that of PSUs, Nayara is selling both diesel and petrol at rates below state-owned firms'.  IOC, BPCL and HPCL had frozen retail prices when international oil prices climbed in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year. While international oil prices have declined, retail prices continue to be on hold for a record 14th month in a row as they recoup the losses suffered last year.  Prices of crude oil, which is turned into fuels like petrol and diesel at refineries, shot above USD 100 per barrel on concerns of supply disruptions in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February last year. While there was no supply disruption, rates continued to remain firm for months thereafter.  To insulate domestic consumers, they stopped daily price revisions from April 6, 2022. As a result of selling fuel below cost, IOC, BPCL and HPCL posted a combined net loss of Rs 21,201.18 crore during April-September.  During this period, private fuel retailers Reliance BP Mobility Ltd (RBML), Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy and Shell lost market share as they were unable to match the below-cost frozen rates of dominant public sector retailers.  But a fall in international oil prices since March has helped bring their retail prices at par with PSU competition or at market price.  IOC, BPCL and HPCL too have broken even but continue to hold retail prices to recoup past losses. This has helped IOC and BPCL post profits in 2022-23 (April 2022 to March 2023) fiscal year despite losses in the first half.  Industry sources said Nayara started pricing petrol and diesel at market rates sometime in March and RBML's 1,574 petrol pumps began selling diesel at par from this month.  This month, Jio-bp introduced superior-grade diesel at rates lower than even the normal diesel sold by state-owned firms. Nayara has followed suit with a similar discount on both petrol and diesel in 10 states.  IOC, BPCL and HPCL first froze petrol and diesel rates for 137 days beginning early November 2021 when five states including Uttar Pradesh went to the polls. A second round of hiatus began on April 6, 2022, and is continuing.  Nayara Energy owns 6,376 petrol pumps in the country.

The heat poses health risks, including diarrhoea, fungal infections and heatstroke. Problems related to eyes and headache are also caused due to soaring mercury and scorching sunlight.As outdoor activities remain limited, children’s reliance on mobile phones and television for entertainment has also become a cause of concern.Dr Saurabh Kumar, a neuropsychiatrist, has cautioned against rising temperature that can also disrupt serotonin regulation, leading to irritability and aggressive behaviour in children. “To counter this, parents are advised to engage their kids in hobbies like swimming or music lessons for keeping their mind and bodies active,” he said.Health experts suggest changes in food and lifestyle in hot weather. “In the summer season when the temperature rises and the sun is more intense, cases of dehydration, heatstroke, lethargy, tiredness and stomach problems are common. To avoid all these problems, it is important to take special care of our diet,” said Dr Nitesh Kumar, an Ayurveda, naturopathy and yoga expert.He suggested certain yoga asanas or techniques for students to tackle the heat. “Chakrasana is beneficial for health and eyes and it also makes the brain healthy. Sheetali Pranayama cools the body temperature. In case of headache in summer, Paschimottanasan can help,” said Dr Nitesh.Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, a city-based physician, emphasized that parents should promptly seek medical help if their children experience symptoms like cramps, fever or loss of appetite. “Adequate hydration is crucial and loose cotton clothing is recommended. Outdoor activities should be avoided between 11am and 4pm,” he said.Maintaining a healthy diet is also vital during this time of the year. Shaziya Shahin, a dietician, advises fruits with high water content, such as watermelon and litchi, along with refreshing salads of tomatoes and cucumbers. “Electrolyte-rich beverages should also be consumed. Packaged fruit juices and junk food should be avoided while protein-rich breakfast is essential,” she said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/weather-spoils-pupils-summer-vacation-plans/articleshow/100665021.cms,2

The rating agency affirmed its 'BBB+' rating - equivalent to the sovereign rating assigned to India - to Reliance (RIL) with a stable outlook, reflecting the view that RIL's cash flows will help it preserve its financial profile, despite elevated investments over the next 24 months.  In a statement, S&amp;amp;P said Reliance's expansion plans for the next two years are manageable. Capex will remain elevated, but lower than the levels of fiscal 2023 (ended March 31, 2023).  The company's leverage will remain at a level commensurate with the current rating, it said. &quot;RIL's operating performance will remain resilient over the next 24 months,&quot; it said. &quot;Earnings growth from RIL's digital and retail segments will continue. This will temper weakness in the O2C business.&quot;  The company, which operates the world's largest single-location oil refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat and is India's biggest petrochemical producer, has in recent years diversified into telecom and digital space, including OTT as well as physical and online retail.  &quot;We believe the company's oil-to-chemicals (O2C - a significant contributor to the company's revenue and EBITDA) segment will continue to maintain more stable and superior margins relative to peers'. This is because RIL is one of the largest and most complex refiners globally.  &quot;The company should therefore be able to withstand a likely weakening in refining margins in Asia amid an economic slowdown and a high base,&quot; S&amp;amp;P said.  Petrochemical demand, it said, is expected to pick up, with China reopening its economy earlier this year, after a pandemic-induced lockdown. This will drive up petrochemical margins from the lows of fiscal 2023.  &quot;We expect EBITDA for RIL's O2C segment to decline 23 per cent in fiscal 2024, before improving 6 per cent to Rs 50,500 crore in fiscal 2025. EBITDA was Rs 62,100 crore in fiscal 2023,&quot; it said.  Earnings in the digital services segment will benefit from increasing data demand and resultant upgrades to higher-priced telecom plans. Meanwhile, new store openings and the proliferation of e-commerce will support the retail business.  &quot;We project RIL's adjusted annual EBITDA will be Rs 1.3 lakh crore to Rs 1.5 lakh crore over the next two years, compared with Rs 1.4 lakh crore in fiscal 2023. We expect the digital and retail segments to constitute about 60 per cent of RIL's total EBITDA by fiscal 2025, compared with 25 per cent in fiscal 2019,&quot; the rating agency said.  RIL's investment plans are sizable but manageable.  &quot;The company's strategy to diversify and dominate its related industries has pushed up its investment spending. We expect this momentum to continue, with annual capital investments of Rs 1.1 lakh crore to Rs 1.2 lakh crore over the next two years,&quot; it said, adding the leverage will remain at a level commensurate with the 'BBB+' ratings.  Resilient earnings and RIL's commitment to keeping its balance sheet in check will support leverage.  &quot;The stable outlook reflects our expectation that RIL's strengthening cash flows and disciplined spending will help the company to preserve its financial profile over the next 12-24 months,&quot; it said.  S&amp;amp;P said it could lower the rating if RIL's capital expenditure, including acquisitions in digital or retail businesses, is higher than expected or cash flow projection for the company reduces due to lower earnings stemming from underperformance in any key business.  The rating could be raised if the company demonstrates a track record of conservative financial policy, such that its debt-to-EBITDA stays well below 2x. A higher rating could also require the digital and retail segments' competitiveness to further strengthen.  Disclaimer:  Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Most of the digital transactions that are taking place are based on OTPs and it becomes a problem when users willingly share them with others, creating a security breach which is exploited by the fraudsters. Godse said that replacing OTPs and going completely without passwords will need another three to four years. While the country is increasing its reliance on digital economy, creating awareness is also important, Godse said, adding that the corporate, banks and the RBI are taking efforts to raise awareness but it is not enough as reaching out to people on such a large scale. The increasing number of cyber fraud cases is a worrisome and providing support mechanism to the victims is important.DSCI is a not-for-profit body working on data protection and is setup by NASSCOM.

The stock of rice is then supplied to the Centre for distribution to different parts of the country. Last year, 80 new units had been added to the list.Rice milling is the process of removing husk and part of the bran from paddy. Primary milling of rice is a key activity in the food grain sector. Districts like Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Bathinda and Mansa have high paddy production and are preferred by the millers.“Rice milling is seen as a profitable venture in the state because Punjab continues to be at the forefront of paddy procurement. Last year, around 150 applications for new rice mills were received and around 80 units were approved. The others could not complete the process in time. Besides, many existing units go in for expansion, which means higher quota of paddy for processing,” said an official. Tarsem Saini, president of the Punjab Rice Millers' Association, said rice milling was a key contributor to the state’s economy. “It is in the benefit of the state to have more rice mills – it will help in higher milling capacity, early processing of paddy and lead to healthy competition among the millers. Also, every unit generates employment for over 100 persons. The rice industry is instrumental in ensuring Punjab’s sizable contribution of food grains into the central pool each year,” said Saini.Paddy is currently grown over 87% of the total area under kharif crops in Punjab. To promote alternate crops, the state government had introduced assured prices for moong last year and 83 lakh quintals moong was procured. This year, however, there are reports that area under moong cultivation has come down from 52,270 hectares registered last season.As per indications, the state government is also likely to miss its target of motivating farmers to grow cotton on 3 lakh hectares in the state as sowing came to an end last week. The area under cotton cultivation has come down drastically from 5.16 lakh hectares in 2011-12 to mere 2.48 lakh hectares in 2022, against the previous year’s target of 4 lakh hectares to revive the traditional crop in the semi-arid region of the state. Apart from heavy reliance on groundwater for the paddy cultivation, the natural resource is also used in processing of paddy in the rice mills as parboiled rice production generally requires a huge amount of water for soaking.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/water-guzzling-paddy-still-agrarian-states-top-choice/articleshow/100754153.cms,2

The centuries-old temple complex has been in need of restoration for several years. With Reliance involved, restoration work has already started and has a pre-puja deadline.Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim confirmed Reliance Industries’ participation in the project and expressed optimism that the work would be completed in time. KMC, in collaboration with the department of tourism, will oversee the completion of the exterior work and the construction of a skywalk, he added.Four years ago, KMC took charge of the restoration project, aiming to preserve and revitalize the temple. However, the pandemic significantly delayed the work. Additionally, the relocation of shops surrounding the temple posed a considerable challenge for KMC. Furthermore, the restoration had to be carried out without disrupting the daily activities at the temple or inconveniencing worshippers.Now, the internal restoration will be expedited using advanced technology. Reliance will focus on restoring the garbhagriha, the shikhara (spire), the mandapa or nata mandir (hall for worshippers), antarala (vestibule), jagati (raised platform), dwar (grand entrance), Shiva temple, and the temple kitchen, KMC officials said.The CM was dissatisfied with the delay and took swift action when Reliance Group approached the government to take over the project. After receiving the proposal, she forwarded it to the mayor, who approved it and issued the work order. As the Kalighat temple is a Grade I heritage structure, all necessary clearances were obtained from the KMC heritage committee.Throughout history, Kalighat temple has witnessed several changes and transformations. During the early 19th century, it underwent a significant renovation under the patronage of the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family, who were influential landowners in Kolkata. They contributed to the construction of a new temple structure and the development of the surrounding area.The temple complex comprises multiple shrines dedicated to different deities, including Goddess Kali, Lord Shiva, and various forms of Goddess Durga. The principal deity, Goddess Kali, is adorned with garlands of skulls, and holds weapons in her multiple hands.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/state-asks-reliance-to-finish-kalighat-restoration-by-puja/articleshow/100835785.cms,2

In FY23, TCS’s expenses towards these external consultants rose to Rs 21,337 crore, from Rs 17,409 crore in FY22. For Infosys, it increased from Rs 16,298 crore in FY22, to Rs 19,096 crore in FY23. Wipro did not state in absolute numbers how much the sub-contracting costs were for the year, but said there has been an increase of Rs 607 crore in subcontracting during the financial year. Most major companies faced pressure on their margins in FY23, and this was attributed to a great extent to subcontracting costs. Ray Wang, principal analyst at Constellation Research, says these companies have been subcontracting primarily to cut down on fixed employee costs, and to quickly fill gaps in resource availability, especially in areas like AI, data science, and UX design. Consultant Pareekh Jain notes that IT companies had enough demand in the first half of FY23 which they were not able to fulfill internally, and hence resorted to having outsourced talent. But now, with demand slowing, attrition dropping, and companies concentrating on hiring local talent, outsourcing costs are expected to come down. Samir Seksaria, CFO of TCS, said in the firm’s annual report that they are expecting the outsourcing cost to come down this year as the pressure to pay lateral hires hefty increments eases out. All of the major firms have been saying in the past few quarterly briefings that they have a rich bench which they will deploy in FY24. Many of the freshers they hired have been trained and are ready to be deployed.

The day’s gains came on the back of strong buying in heavyweights like Reliance Industries, M&M and Axis Bank, BSE data showed.In early trades, most of the Asian markets were deep in the red after the minutes of the last meeting of US Federal Reserve’s rate setting committee showed that most members were ready to hike rate of interest in June, aimed at containing inflation, but took a pause. The tone of the minutes made market players globally jittery that rate hikes would resume in the US Fed’s next meeting and markets began selling.As a result, Hong Kong closed 3% down while Japan was down 1.7%. The selloff continued in Europe too with Dax in Germany down 2.6% in late trades while FTSE was down 2.2%. The US markets also opened lower with Dow Jones index down 1.3% in mid-session while Nasdaq was down 1%.On Dalal Street, however, the sensex set a new all-time peak at 65,833 points. The strong buying also lifted investors’ wealth to a record level with BSE’s market cap at Rs 304.5 lakh crore.Foreign funds took the lead again with a net buying figure of nearly Rs 2,650 crore for the day, BSE data showed. The total net inflow for July is already above Rs 20,000 crore (about $2.5 billion), BSE and CDSL data showed.According to Siddhartha Khemka, head, retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, the leading indices have moved up nearly 5% in the last eight trading sessions, scaling new highs on the back of a healthy progress in monsoon, strong FII inflow and decent pre-quarterly business updates from major companies. “We expect the market uptrend to continue with stock-specific action. Global cues were weak due to the release of hawkish minutes of the US Federal Reserve’s June meeting. Investors will keep an eye on US non-farm payroll and unemployment data,” Khemka said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-scales-new-peak-despite-weak-global-mkts/articleshow/101558492.cms,1

India’s banks have largely remained insulated from a global crisis in the industry with their heavy reliance on local markets. Meanwhile, the nation’s consumer and capital goods companies are expected to benefit from commodity prices that have come off peaks seen after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Across industries, we’re seeing costs coming off sharply, so that will reflect in earnings,” said Varun Saboo, Mumbai-based head of equities at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers Ltd. Saboo estimates earnings growth in the ballpark of 15% for the companies in the benchmark NSE Nifty 50 index. Asia’s top software services exporter Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. will kick off on Wednesday the first-quarter earnings season for Indian companies.Conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd, which has a 10th of the weightage in the Nifty 50 index, would see its operating profit rising in the June quarter, on back of strong performance in its oil-to-chemicals and digital services segments, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Banking boomThe bad-loan ratio at Indian banks was at a decade low of 3.9% at the end of March 2023, the Reserve Bank of India said in its Financial Stability Report. It expects the ratio to fall further to 3.6% by March 2024. Top four private sector lenders in the Nifty 50 index — HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank — may see quarterly profits grow between 18% and 38%. Their net interest margins are projected to stay above or around the 4% mark, among the highest in Asia. State Bank of India, the country’s top lender by assets, will see quarterly profit more than double, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank’s interest rate hikes have also bumped up lending margins at the local lenders. A possible repricing of deposits could shave off some margin, although the impact would be limited until the central bank starts cutting rates.Rajesh Cheruvu, chief investment officer at Liechtenstein royalty-backed LGT Wealth India, expects net interest margins to shrink by about 30 basis points for the sector until the key rate goes lower, which is not expected at least till September-end, according to a Bloomberg survey. Margin and return on assets remained at levels “too good to be true,” Cheruvu said.Consumption drive A relief in cost pressures from a fall in energy and material prices coupled with improving supply chains after easing of Covid-related restrictions were likely to help consumer, capital goods and cement companies improve earnings while a takeoff in volumes is expected to sustain. Lower crude prices would benefit earnings of paint makers, and a drop in palm oil prices would help makers of soaps, detergents and packaged foods, according to Ajay Thakur, a consumer-sector analyst at Anand Rathi.High retail prices of gasoline and diesel will help margins at refiners, with India’s top three oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. forecast to grow earnings.Tech headwinds A government-brokered bailout of crisis-hit Credit Suisse Group AG by UBS Group AG, and the collapse of two mid-sized US banks earlier this year stoked fears of unrest in the global banking industry, probably forcing many financial firms to cut their discretionary spending on information technology services. India’s $245 billion technology sector, with a key exposure to banks, might face pressure on pricing, large deals wins and margins. The big four software services exporters — Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd — get more than a quarter of their revenues from the financial sector. Increased wages may also chip away at margins, analysts at Jefferies and BNP Paribas wrote in separate notes. But some believe the risks are priced into the valuations. The NSE Nifty IT index currently trades at less than 24 times earnings, down from the record high of about 39 times earnings at the start of 2022. “It’s been one and a half years of this fear of recession, and fear of cutting spending being talked about in the market,” said Siddarth Bhamre, head of research at Religare Broking Ltd. “For me, IT is available at reasonable valuations.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-consumer-companies-to-drive-first-quarter-earnings-amid-it-uncertainties-in-india/articleshow/101624788.cms,1

The talks are in a ""very, very nascent"" stage and no potential buyer or partner has been approached so far, and it remains unclear how the process will pan out, the person added. ""Talks have begun internally (on) what makes sense to do,"" said the source, adding discussions were being driven by executives at Disney  headquarters in the U.S. Disney did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The company's shares closed up 1.6% on Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal was first to report news of Disney's talks and said the company had reached out to at least one bank about ways to help the India business grow, while sharing some of the costs. The discussions come at a time when Disney has faced increasing pressure due to the emergence of Reliance Industries' streaming platform JioCinema, run by Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani. He has been marketing his streaming platform by offering free access to Indian Premier League cricket tournament, digital rights of which were earlier with Disney. Research firm CLSA has estimated Disney+ Hotstar's subscriber base shrank by nearly 5 million users in India after it lost the digital rights for IPL. Reliance's broadcast venture Viacom18, which runs JioCinema, also struck a deal with Warner Bros in April for HBO and other popular content such as Succession. Several of these top rated shows earlier aired in India on the Disney platform. Viacom18's shareholders include Reliance, Paramount Global as well as Bodhi Tree, which is a joint venture between James Murdoch and a former Star India executive, Uday Shankar. Disney's India business comprises the Disney+ Hotstar streaming service and Star India, which it took over when it acquired the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox in 2019. The source, who declined to be named as the talks are confidential, said it will be difficult to find an outright buyer in India as the enterprise value of the India business was seen around $15-16 billion when Disney took over Fox's business. Star India, which was rebranded as Disney Star last year, encompasses dozens of TV channels and a stake in a movie production company. Disney, like its peers in streaming and the wider media industry, is cutting costs as macro economic headwinds weigh on its advertising revenue and subscriber growth.  In February, the company said it would cut 7,000 jobs as part of an effort to save $5.5 billion in costs in a sweeping restructuring of the company.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/web-series/news/english/walt-disney-in-talks-for-sale-or-partnership-for-india-digital-and-tv-business/articleshow/101925099.cms,1

The co","MUMBAI: Reliance Industries Ltd’s financial services unit was valued at about $20 billion after a special session conducted by exchanges to discover its trading value. Jio Financial Services Ltd was priced at Rs 261.85 ($3.19) apiece based on the difference between Reliance’s stock price at Wednesday’s close and trading at 10:00am Thursday in Mumbai following an hour-long special pre-market session. Reliance, India’s most valuable company, will now trade on exchanges without its financial services unit. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Axis Securities had expected Jio Financial to be priced in the range of Rs 160 to Rs 189 per share. Avendus Spark estimated the company to be valued at as much as $14 billion.On Wednesday, Reliance Industries said after the spinoff, each share in Jio Financial would be equivalent to 4.7% of Reliance’s closing price that day. This would value Jio’s stock at Rs 133 apiece. The spinoff will bring Mukesh Ambani, one of Asia’s richest men, one step closer to creating the type of multi-purpose empire that’s similar to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Ambani has big ambitions to gather various segments of the business - including telecoms, financial and e-commerce services - all within a larger conglomerate.Reliance’s shares rose as much as 1.7% to Rs 2,632 on Thursday. New methodologyThis marks the first time that Indian exchanges utilized a new method of price discovery for listed companies undergoing mergers and acquisitions as they seek to minimize price swings in benchmark indexes. Trading in Jio Financial will start at a later date but authorities are watching for any market volatility as Reliance Industries carries about 11% weight in the Nifty 50 gauge.“Passive funds have gone big in India over the last 3 to 4 years, so exchanges had to come up with rules to avoid any disruption to index components,” said Abhilash Pagaria, an analyst with Nuvama Wealth Management Ltd. “There can’t be a better way of handling a demerger.” Pagaria said it may take up to a month for Jio Financial’s shares to be listed since the entity will be carved out from one of India’s biggest companies.RIL offered one share of Jio Financial for every share owned by RIL’s investors. RIL’s stock closed at an all-time high on Wednesday as investors made a last-minute attempt to qualify for Jio’s shares. Ambani surprised investors last year by announcing the demerger of Reliance Strategic Investments and Holdings Ltd and its subsequent listing as Jio Financial to unlock the value of his oil-to-telecoms conglomerate.While analysts have indicated that the financial unit will be valued at one time price-to-book of trailing 12-month earnings, they expect the company to command a premium valuation as Reliance details a strategic roadmap going ahead.Read More on Reliance “Even though this entity has little revenue at this point, there is vast potential for growth, they can expand rapidly,” said Deven Choksey, managing director at KR Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt Ltd.

According to a Bloomberg survey of 14 brokerages, the conglomerate’s consolidated net sales are expected to come in at Rs 2.14 lakh crore and net profit is estimated at Rs 16,995.50 crore according to seven brokerages. The company is scheduled to report its June quarter earnings on July 21.  &quot;EBITDA to marginally increase by 1 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 38,800 crore, with O2C EBITDA down 4 percent to Rs 15,600 crore on lower GRMs, partly offset by a recovery in the petchem margins. We expect net subscriber addition of 6.5 million for Jio, with a 1 percent higher ARPU at Rs 180. Retail EBITDA should be up 2 percent QoQ to Rs 5,000 crore, while upstream EBITDA would be largely flat. We estimate consolidated adjusted PAT, after JPL-RRVL MI, to decline 14 percent to Rs 16,500 crore, on higher ETR quarter on quarter at 22 percent,&quot; said Emkay Research in a note to investors.  The Mukesh Ambani led-conglomerate hit its 52-week high on the bourses on June 19 at Rs 2,855.00 a share on BSE ahead of the result, driven by the demerger of its financial services arm. On July 20 at closing, shares were settled at Rs 2619.80, up 1.2 percent from its previous close.  Although RIL does not report gross refining margins (GRMs) separately, analysts expect that it would have achieved GMRs of $11 a barrel in the June quarter compared to the implied GRM of $13/barrel in Q4FY23. It is seen following the declining trend in benchmark Singapore GRM, which has plunged over 70 percent year-on-year and close to 50 percent QoQ on weak demand.  The analysts predict that the company's petrochemical EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) is likely to remain relatively unchanged QoQ due to limited pricing power in the market. The ample supply and insufficient demand are the primary factors contributing to this situation. In the ‘oil and gas’ segment, EBIT is expected to have remained stable, with a modest 1.6 percent QoQ increase in revenues.  Brokerage firm JP Morgan predicts that Reliance Jio will maintain its pattern of quarterly net subscriber additions and experience a slightly higher average revenue per user (ARPU) in the first quarter. As for Reliance Retail, it is expected to achieve a YoY revenue growth of 25 percent. This growth will be driven by the expansion of stores and the acquisition of floor space, particularly in the grocery segment. JP Morgan also foresees that Reliance Retail's revenue growth will surpass that of its competitors in the industry.  &quot;We expect Jio to report strong net adds of 7 million in Q1 (vs 6.4 million in Q4) and largely flattish ARPU leading to overall revenue growth of 1.6 percent QoQ. Jio, unlike Bharti, didn't have any benefits from the minimum tariff recharge. Furthermore, we think as Jio's 5G network is deepening, a lesser number of users did top-ups in this IPL-heavy quarter as 5G provided better speeds,&quot; said BofA in its note.  &quot;We expect steady momentum at retail and factor in 22 percent YoY growth (19 percent in Q4) led by continued uptake in grocery and fashion business. We model a flattish QoQ EBITDA margin of 7.1 percent and EBIT margin of 5.4 percent,&quot; the report added.  According to analysts, the focus is likely to shift towards expectations for significant announcements during the annual general meeting (AGM), which is anticipated to take place in August. Historically, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) uses the AGM as a platform to reveal value-unlocking catalysts and outline future growth plans.  At the last AGM on August 30, Mukesh Ambani told shareholders that he will share an update on the planned initial public offer (IPO) of Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio in the AGM next year. Hence, analysts expect noteworthy announcements to be made during this year's AGM.  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

While higher subscriber addition, stable ARPU (average revenue per user) and more users converting to 5G boosted telecom segment earnings, the retail segment performed better than peers despite no demand trigger such as the festive season.Finance cost jumped 46 per cent to Rs 5,837 crore due to higher interest rates and loan balance. Depreciation/amortisation expenses were up 31.7 per cent to Rs 11,775 crore due to expanded asset base across all businesses and higher network utilisation in the digital services business.Operationally, the company posted a 5 per cent growth in EBITDA or earnings before tax, at Rs 41,982 crore.Revenue from operations fell to Rs 2.1 lakh crore from Rs 2.22 lakh crore in the year-ago period and Rs 2.16 lakh crore in January-March 2023. This was primarily because crude oil prices fell 31 per cent.The mainstay oil refining and petrochemicals business, called O2C, posted a 23.2 per cent fall in EBITDA to Rs 15,271 crore.Rising demand, low inventories and oil market disruption centred around Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushed cracks -- the differential between a barrel of crude oil (raw material) and the petroleum products refined from it -- to record last year.Diesel cracks in June last year soared to $74.95 a barrel while petrol cracks neared $42. Jet fuel cracks soared to $62. Diesel cracks in June this year hovered between $16 and $19 while petrol cracks were in the range of $10 to $14.""Demand was impacted by destocking on recessionary fears and high-interest rates, as well as slower than expected ramp-up in China markets,"" the statement said adding exports fell 28 per cent.With the consumer base swelling to 448.5 million from 439.3 million at the end of March and ARPU rising to Rs 180.5 from Rs 178.8, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd - the digital services business - posted a 12.5 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 5,098 crore in Q1. Also aiding the business was consumers migrating to its latest offering 5G services and IPL streaming bringing in bumper advertisement revenue.Profits from retail business climbed 19 per cent to Rs 2,448 crore as store count rose to 18,446 from 18,040.Oil and gas EBITDA soared 27 per cent to Rs 4,015 crore as gas production from KG-D6 block rose on hooking to the production of the deepest field.""Block KG D6 is currently producing around 27 million standard cubic meters per day (up from 19 mmscmd in the previous quarter) and is expected to reach 30 mmscmd in coming months,"" it said.The company said its net debt stood at Rs 1.26 lakh crore.Commenting on the results, Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Ltd said: ""Reliance's strong operating and financial performance this quarter demonstrates the resilience of our diversified portfolio of businesses that cater to demand across industrial and consumer segments.""Jio's wide range of quality offerings at affordable price points has enabled strong growth in subscriber base, he said adding accelerated roll-out of Jio's 'True 5G' services is propelling the nation's digital transformation at an unprecedented pace.Retail business delivered robust growth, with fast-paced store additions and steady growth in footfalls while O2C business delivered a resilient performance despite continuing global macro headwinds.""Commencement of MJ field operations during the quarter will enhance India's energy security, with total production from KGD6 block rising to 30 mmscmd in the coming months,"" he said.Ambani said the process of demerger of the financial services business - Jio Financial Services Limited - is on track with key approvals in place.""I firmly believe that Jio Financial Services is uniquely positioned to foster financial inclusion in India,"" he added.

Additionally, RIL, along with Olectra Greentech, a subsidiary of Megha Engineering and Infrastructures (MEIL), introduced a hydrogen bus in February, targeting commercial launch within a year. In another step, RIL joined forces with Bharat Benz to develop India's first intercity luxury concept coach powered by hydrogen fuel cell technology.The H2ICE technology stands out as a combustion engine that can use hydrogen or a mixture of hydrogen and diesel fuel without requiring significant modifications to the vehicle's powertrain. This adaptability allows for easier conversion of vehicles to hydrogen-powered ones with minor adjustments.RIL's partners state that these hydrogen-powered vehicles have an impressive travel range of approximately 400 km on a single fill, enabling long-distance travel between cities using clean fuel. Furthermore, refueling with hydrogen takes just 15 minutes for this range coverage. These vehicles will undergo rigorous trials, validation, and safety assessments over the next year.Through its partnership with Ashok Leyland, RIL plans to retrofit engines for the company's fleet of trucks. RIL contracts a fleet of around 45,000 vehicles that are used for its refining and marketing operations. RIL's vision is to transition these trucks to green hydrogen, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable logistics ecosystem.Barnik Chitran Maitra, managing partner, India & South Asia, of consulting firm Arthur D Little was quoted in the report sayinf that the domestic use cases for green hydrogen may start with small pilots. According to Maitra, the focus will shift towards partnerships with global shipping firms, international transmission system operators, and international power generators, that are expected to replace fossil fuels with green hydrogen in the next five years.RIL also has plans to retail green hydrogen through its Jio-BP retail outlets. With around 1,500 outlets already in operation, RIL aims to expand the network to 5,000, making green hydrogen easily accessible to the public, the report said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-industries-eyes-green-hydrogen-production-in-2-years-aims-to-bring-down-production-cost-to-just-1-per-kg-by-2030/articleshow/102388117.cms,0

This facility will facilitate the creation of photovoltaic panels, energy storage, green hydrogen production, and fuel cell systems. With a target of achieving 100GW of solar energy by 2030, RIL remains committed to these aspirations.Under the Solar Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme, RIL has been granted Integrated Solar Manufacturing rights for a 10GW yearly capacity, encompassing PolySilicon, Wafer, Cell, and Module production.

They added that the damaged portion will be repaired.However, this has put a question mark on the project that was conceived and executed under the Smart City Mission at the cost of Rs 13 crore.The MC had decided to install the chain-link fence along a 14-km stretch of the nullah. After the fencing was done on a major portion alongside the drain, the officials realised the need to install gates in the fencing to allow cleaning of the drain on a regular basis. However, even this proposal was hanging fire and no decision has been taken so far as it would have escalated the project cost.In July, the Buddha Nullah water flooded many localities and due to the heavy flow the fencing got damaged at many locations. The fencing is missing from some places now and at others, it is hanging in the air ready to collapse anytime.An MC official said, “The fence will either be repaired or replaced by a new one. However, we will not install fence on the remaining portion as the ruling party MLAs have refused to get it done. Even the proposal to install gates in the fencing has been held up for the time being.”Meanwhile, a Chander Nagar resident, Ranjit Singh, said, “The fence is hanging on the banks of the nullah. In order to install the chain-link fence, the officials had reduced the width of road as well.

Per-user data consumption on Jio’s network has also surged, with the average user now consuming over 25 GB every month. This translates to monthly data traffic of 1100 crore GBs, representing a 45% year-on-year growth,” Ambani said at the 46th AGM of Reliance Industries. Indicating an aggressive expansion plan in 5G, Ambani said that the company has been adding one 5G cell to our network every 10 seconds. “… we will have nearly one million 5G cells operational in our network by December.”He said the company began 5G rollout last October. “In just nine months, Jio 5G is already present in over 96% of the census towns of our country. And we're on track to cover the entire country by December of this year. This makes Jio 5G the fastest-ever 5G rollout of this scale anywhere in the world.”On Jio AirFiber, the fixed-wireless broadband offering from the company, he said that the effort is to provide broadband to areas that have remained unconnected due to the complexities and delays involved in extending optical fiber to their premises. “Jio AirFiber uses our pan-India 5G network and advanced wireless technologies to bypass the need for last-mile fibre. Through optical fiber, we can currently connect around 15,000 premises daily. But with Jio AirFiber, we can supercharge this expansion with up to 150,000 connections per day. That is a ten-fold increase, expanding our addressable market over the next three years to over 200 million high-paying homes and premises.”Ambani also outlined aggressive plans for Artificial Intelligence (AI), terming it the ""most exciting frontier of growth"" for Jio. Ambani said the company will create up to 2,000 MW of AI-ready computing capacity, across both cloud and edge locations, while adopting sustainable practices and greener future.A global AI revolution is reshaping the world and intelligent applications will redefine and revolutionise industries, economies, and even daily life, sooner than expected, he said, adding that to stay globally competitive, India must harness AI for innovation, growth, and national prosperity.

He added that national 5G rollout will be completed by the end of this year.With as many as 450 million telecom subscribers — of which 50 million have already migrated to 5G — Ambani announced aggressive plans to further expand the scope of telecom operations, indicating that the company will continue to maintain its strong push in the business, which has been witnessing rapid growth since its launch in September 2016.“Jio’s customer base has now crossed the milestone of 450 million subscribers, reflecting a year-on-year reve nue growth of over 20%. Peruser data consumption on Jio’s network has also surged, with the average user now consuming over 25 GB every month. This translates to monthly data traffic of 1100 crore GBs, representing a 45% year-on-year growth,” Ambani said at the 46th AGM of Reliance Industries.He added that the company has been adding one 5G cell to network every 10 seconds. “… we will have nearly one million 5G cells operational in the network by De cember.” Ambani said the company began 5G rollout last October. “In just nine months, Jio 5G is already present in over 96% of the census towns of our country. And we’re on track to cover the entire country by December of this year. This makes Jio 5G the fastest-ever 5G rollout of this scale anywhere in the world.”On Jio AirFiber, the fixed-wireless broadband offering from the company, he said the effort is to provide broadband to areas that have re mained unconnected due to complexities and delays involved in extending optical fiber to premises. “Jio AirFiber uses our pan-India 5G network and advanced wireless technologies to bypass the need for last-mile fibre. Through optical fiber, we can currently connect around 15,000 premises daily. But with Jio AirFiber, we can supercharge this expansion with up to 150,000 connections per day. That is a 10-fold increase, expanding our addressable market over the next three years to over 200 million high-paying homes and premises.”Ambani also outlined aggressive plans for artificial intelligence (AI), terming it the “most exciting frontier of growth” for Jio. “Here is my promise to our countrymen. Seven years ago, Jio promised broadband connectivity to everyone, everywhere. We have delivered. Today Jio promises AI to everyone, everywhere. And we shall deliver.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/jio-5g-across-india-by-december-wireless-net-launch-in-september/articleshow/103150627.cms,0

The inception of biogas dates back to 1897 when British civil engineer Charles James initiated the first biogas plant during his work on the drainage of the Homeless Leper Asylum in Matunga, Bombay. Since then, biogas has been a steadfast source of energy for Indian households, community facilities, and dairy farms.The Indian Biogas Association projects the installation of 5,000 biogas plants by 2030, with an estimated investment of Rs 1.75 lakh crore in the sector.India Inc. is now showing a keen interest in the humble biogas. Reliance Industries, a prominent energy conglomerate, has unveiled plans to establish 100 compressed biogas (CBG) plants, signaling a shift towards greener energy sources. Adani Total Gas, part of the Adani Group, intends to set up five CBG plants within the next five years, with further expansion on the horizon.Furthermore, Thermax, based in Pune, has collaborated with EverEnviro Resource Management to launch Thermax Bioenergy Solutions, aiming to set up bio-CNG projects. Industry insiders reveal that EverEnviro is poised to invest nearly Rs 10,000 crore in this sector over the coming years. Their wholly owned subsidiary, Green Growth Equity Fund (GGEF), has ambitious plans to establish 14 CBG plants across the nation.Notably, oil marketing giants are not lagging behind in this sustainable energy transition. Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL), and Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) have issued numerous letters of intent for the establishment of compressed biogas (CBG) plants.CBG, a greener fuel derived from waste and biomass sources, has properties similar to compressed natural gas (CNG) and serves a variety of purposes, including automotive, industrial, and commercial applications.So what has prompted these companies to turn their attention to biogas? Gaurav Kedia, Chairman of the Indian Biogas Association (IBA), provides insights: ""It's the technical, financial, and social aspect of biogas. The technology is now getting mature, so people can now set up large scale biogas plant.”According to Kedia, on the financial front, there is government support and a ready market for biogas has emerged. Additionally, organic fertilizer from these plants is gaining popularity, particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, which heightened health consciousness. These factors combine to make the biogas sector highly lucrative at present, he said.As part of their efforts to integrate CBG into the city gas grid, Gail has also embraced this green fuel. In a recent development, IBA has advocated for a fair and remunerative price of organic fertilizer, also known as 'fermented organic manure' (FOM), set at approximately Rs 5.5 per kg. This initiative is aimed at bolstering biogas plant operations in the country. In support of these efforts, the government has announced the Market Development Assistance (MDA) Scheme, with an approval of Rs 1,451 crore, dedicated to promoting organic fertilizer.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-energy-giants-like-reliance-adani-indian-oil-are-betting-big-on-the-humble-biogas/articleshow/103345455.cms,0

The oil-to-telecom conglomerate owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani is the operator of the world's biggest refining complex which houses two plants with a combined capacity of about 1.4 million barrels per day.  Reliance will temporarily shut a crude distillation unit and delayed coking in SEZ refinery, fluidized catalytic cracker in DTA refinery and a refinery off gas cracker, the company said in a statement to the stock exchanges. The maintenance of these units lasting between four-to-seven-weeks will begin from mid-September.  The company added that all other units of the Jamnagar facility will operate normally during the maintenance period.  Reuters had reported in August that the company planned to shut some units for maintenance in September-October at the Jamnagar complex citing sources.  While Reliance said that it does not expect any material impact on overall operations of Jamnagar complex, trade sources told Reuters last month that the shutdown of units would curtail the company's crude imports and may push up gasoline margins.

The executives did not clarify when the company planned to start selling these batteries.Development of battery storage solutions is a part of Reliance's bigger $10 billion green push towards clean energy projects. The company aims to cut dependence on its mainstay oil-to-chemical business and be net zero carbon by 2035.The company acquired two battery companies for about $200 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively -- UK-based Faradion that makes sodium-ion batteries, and Lithium Werks, that produces lithium iron phosphate (LFP)batteries. Reliance displayed LFP chemistry based battery at the exhibition.A company presentation at the event showed it is also working on customizable batteries for business and individual usage, intelligent swap stations and integrated charging networks. Reliance doesn't plan to get in to EV manufacturing but will partner with EV makers, the presentation showed.Reliance won an incentive last year to set up a 5 gigawatt hours (GWh) battery manufacturing facility under India's $2.4 billion programme that aims to boost local battery cell production.The factory will be set up by 2026 and will make batteries and containerised energy storage solutions.Clean auto technology is central to India's strategy of cutting pollution in major cities and reaching its broader climate goals. Electric vehicles currently make up a fraction of total sales in India mainly due to their high price as the batteries are imported, and a lack of charging infrastructure.The government is trying to encourage swappable batteries to bring down costs and promote wider adoption of EVs.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/news/reliance-unveils-swappable-multipurpose-batteries-for-evs/articleshow/104156546.cms,2

For investors seeking potential winners in the equity market, a focus on large-cap stocks may be worthwhile. According to an ET analysis, approximately half of the Nifty50 stocks, including prominent names like Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Tata Consumer, and Hindustan Unilever, have exhibited underperformance in comparison to the Nifty benchmark over the last two years.Analysts assert that when the market rebounds from its current weakness, large-cap stocks are likely to outshine their smaller counterparts. This is attributed to the perceived overstretching of valuations in mid-cap and small-cap stocks.Notable stocks such as Wipro, HDFC Life Insurance, Infosys, LTI Mindtree, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserv, TCS, Reliance Industries, HCL Technologies, HDFC Bank, Hindustan Unilever, and Tata Steel have witnessed declines ranging from 5% to 39% in the past two years. During the same period, the Nifty index recorded an 11% increase, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 250 indices surged by approximately 29%.Sanjeev Prasad, co-head of Kotak Institutional Equities, expressed optimism, stating, ""We find much better value in top large-cap stocks and expect them to outperform in the next 6-12 months, as the current euphoria in other large-, mid- and small-cap stocks may fade over time, and their valuations realign with their fundamentals."" 104306968India's most valuable stock in terms of market capitalization, Reliance Industries, experienced a nearly 6% decline over the past two years.

It has backed the board appointments of his twin-elder siblings, Isha and Akash Ambani — both 31 — in the shareholder vote that will close on Oct. 26. Anant is 28 years old.ISS’s objections echo the recommendations from Mumbai-based Institutional Investor Advisory Services, or IIAS, which said in an Oct. 9 report, that “at 28 years of age,” appointment of the young Ambani scion “does not align with our voting guidelines.” IIAS has supported the proposals seeking to elect Isha and Akash. Reliance did not respond to Bloomberg’s queries but told the proxy companies that Anant has “the relevant experience and maturity to add value to the board deliberations” given his participation in the conglomerate’s businesses and the grooming he has received from senior leadership over the years. Both ISS and IIAS added Reliance’s response to their reports. Another international proxy firm, Glass Lewis, is in favor of Anant’s appointment. “We do not single out Anant Ambani from the other siblings based on experience,” Decky Windarto, Glass Lewis’s director of Asia-Pacific Research, said in an emailed response. “We noted that the other two directors up for election are just three years older than Anant, with similar professional experiences.”While the induction of Anant and his siblings as non-executive, non-independent directors, is critical to the succession plan announced by Asia’s richest person, the counterpoints from proxy advisories show that Ambani and the “next-generation” leaders at $190 billion group will continue to be in focus for corporate governance watchers.Evolving ExpectationsThe recommendations from ISS and IIAS also point to the evolving investor expectations from a conglomerate that now counts Google and Meta Platforms Inc. among marquee investors in its consumer businesses.Reliance’s founders own over 41% shares in the company, making them the single largest voting chunk. The three resolutions need a majority of votes cast to go through. Foreign and local institutions, that often vote based on proxy firms’ recommendations, own close to 40% in Reliance. Their stance will be known after the voting closes. Succession is a crucial issue for the billionaire. Ambani, who was appointed to the Reliance board in 1977 at the age of 20, had to tackle a bitter fraternal feud after his father died without a will in 2002. From Reliance investors’ viewpoint, the leadership transition is critical as the fossil fuel behemoth transforms into a consumer and technology titan with massive green energy ambitions. Ambani told shareholders in August he intends to helm the company for five years as he prepares his children.Akash has been working at Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. since 2014 and is currently its chairman, said the company notice to shareholders. Isha has been driving the expansion of the retail business as an executive director of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. Both have presented to shareholders at the flagship’s annual shareholder meeting in the past few years. Anant, said to be driving the expansion of energy and materials businesses, especially green energy, has yet to formally address shareholders. Anant has been a member of Reliance’s executive committee, is on the boards of two green energy subsidiaries and “has been part of the decision making for the large strategic investments and partnerships,” according to the company response included in the ISS report.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ambanis-youngest-son-anant-faces-proxy-firms-pushback-on-board-seat/articleshow/104484519.cms,2

It has been weighing other options for the business, including an outright sale or setting up a joint venture, Bloomberg News reported in July.Still, Disney’s India streaming platform managed to draw in a record 43 million viewers on Sunday for the men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 match between India and New Zealand, the company said in a statement.

The report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), underscores the environmental advantages of expanding biogas projects, including waste management, reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and enhanced renewable energy production. According to the report's author Purva Jain, an energy analyst at IEEFA, ""Biogas has the potential to replace natural gas and other high-emission fossil fuels. By eliminating carbon dioxide (CO2) and impurities like hydrogen sulfide, its methane content can be upgraded to 90 per cent, making it calorifically equivalent to natural gas. This upgraded biogas, known as biomethane, is pipeline-ready and can be integrated into gas grids as a non-fossil gas, she said. ""By adopting appropriate production methods and addressing methane leaks during production, upgrading, and supply stages, biogas can offer India a cleaner alternative to its reliance on imported natural gas,"" Jain said. Despite its clear advantages, the biogas sector has struggled to gain traction in India. The report identifies several reasons for this, including the absence of a comprehensive market ecosystem, pricing challenges, complex approval processes, and fragmented government support. Jain said the government has begun to address these issues. In 2021, various types of support were consolidated under the National Bioenergy Scheme. ""Moreover, the introduction of the GOBARdhan (Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan) scheme as an umbrella initiative of the government will help in this consolidation. It covers the entire gamut of schemes/policies promoting organic waste conversion to biogas or compressed biogas (CBG),"" she says. The report also highlights recent policy developments, such as revising the compressed biogas rate in response to global gas price increases and plans to mandate natural gas marketing companies to procure five per cent compressed biogas. These measures have reignited private sector interest in compressed biogas, with companies like Reliance Industries Limited and the Adani Group showing strong enthusiasm. However, the report emphasises that the government must do more to fully unlock biogas's potential in India. This includes encouraging increased investments and private sector involvement, improving market viability for CBG and biogas slurry, increasing financial access for biogas plant development, and promoting feedstock mapping for input availability. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that energy crops are not used for biogas, as this can lead to indirect land use changes, as seen with ethanol and biodiesel in Brazil, which can have a detrimental impact on climate and the environment through increased carbon emissions. ""A key step will be to guarantee the offtake of CBG by various natural gas-using industries to expedite the achievement of decarbonization goals. The introduction of take-or-pay arrangements will be a significant move in this direction,"" Jain said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-can-reduce-fossil-fuel-dependence-cut-import-bills-by-29-billion-through-biogas-adoption-report/articleshow/104723283.cms,0

The results of the shareholder vote were posted by Reliance on Friday.The filing showed Isha got 98.21 per cent votes in favour of her appointment and 1.78 per cent in against. Akash got 98.05 per cent votes in favour and 1.94 per cent in against. Anant got 92.75 per cent favourable votes but 41.58 crore or 7.24 per cent voted against his appointment.Institutional Shareholder Services Inc, an international proxy advisory firm, had recommended that shareholders vote against the proposal to appoint Ambani's youngest son Anant on the board of the family-controlled Reliance.The proxy advisory firm had pitched for a vote against Anant because of his little experience.Like ISS, Mumbai-based Institutional Investor Advisory Services, or IIAS, too stated that ""at 28 years of age"", appointment of the young Ambani scion ""does not align with our voting guidelines"".IIAS supported the proposals seeking to elect Isha and Akash. Glass Lewis, another international proxy firm, voted in favour of Anant's appointment.The board appointments are a part of the succession planning by Ambani, who was appointed to the Reliance board in 1977 at the age of 20 and had to tackle a bitter fraternal feud after his father died without a will in 2002.Akash has been working at telecom/digital arm Reliance Jio Infocomm since 2014 and is currently its chairman, while Isha is driving the expansion of the retail business as an executive director of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. Both have presented to shareholders at the flagship's annual shareholder meeting in the past few years.Anant is said to be leading the expansion of energy and materials businesses, especially green energy.The scions will be paid only a fee for attending board and committee meetings, the company had said previously in a resolution seeking shareholder nod for their appointment on its board.While Ambani, 66, drew nil salary from the company since the 2020-21 fiscal year, other executive directors including his cousins Nikhil and Hital are paid a salary, perquisites, allowances and commission.His three children -- twins Akash and Isha, and Anant -- will get only a sitting fee and a commission on the profit earned by the firm.The terms of the appointment of the three are the same as the ones on which Ambani's wife Nita was appointed to the company board in 2014. She earned a sitting fee of Rs 6 lakh and a commission of Rs 2 crore in the 2022-23 fiscal year (April 2022 to March 2023).Reliance has four broad verticals -- the oil-to-chemical (O2C) business that houses the world's largest single-location refining complex and petrochemical plants, telecom and digital business, retail (both physical and online) and new energy.

They have been passionately involved in our consumer businesses since inception. Anant has also joined our New Energy business with great zeal. In fact, he is spending most of his time in Jamnagar,” Mukesh Ambani said at the AGM. Mukesh Ambani emphasized that his children have inherited the entrepreneurial mindset of their grandfather, Dhirubhai Ambani. He also highlighted that his children are part of a young team of talented leaders and professionals who are already making significant contributions to the company. The Ambani siblings receive daily mentoring from senior leaders, including their father and the board of directors, he said.However, not all advisory firms shared the same view. Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), a domestic proxy advisory firm, recommended that Reliance shareholders vote against Anant Ambani's appointment to the board. Similarly, US-based Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) also made a similar recommendation, the ET report said.IiAS cited a misalignment with its voting guidelines due to Anant's age, which is 28 years. ISS, on the other hand, based its recommendation on Anant's limited leadership or board experience, which amounts to just six years.This latest development is an important step in the implementation of Reliance's succession plans.

The brokerage firm re","NEW DELHI: Kotak Securities is bullish on a few select large-cap and BFSI sector stocks and advised investors to add quality stocks to their portfolio at a time when the broader market valuations are relatively rich.Opportunities arising from market correction should be used, the brokerage said in a report 'Diwali Muhurat Picks'. It gave 'Buy' recommendations for eight stocks - Aegis Logistics, Axis Bank, Cipla, DLF, Infosys, Mahindra and Mahindra, Reliance Industries, and SRF. It sees a 10-26 per cent possible return on investments in these recommended stocks over the course of the next 12 months.According to the brokerage, the recent sharp correction in stock prices may reflect growing recognition of short-term and medium-term challenges or a 'natural' correction in the market from 'high' levels.""In our view, large-cap stocks offer better reward-risk balance given more reasonable valuations versus lofty valuations of most mid-and small-cap stocks,"" Kotak Securities said.For Reliance Industries where it sees 26 per cent potential returns, Kotak Securities argued that the Mukesh Ambani company can explore reorganization of the company into three independent entities for its three different business verticals.Reorganization, it said, will help the company in achieving three mutually linked objectives - structure, succession, and segregation.""We assume RIL will list its retailing (Reliance Retail and related entities) and telecommunications (Jio Platforms and related entities) over the next 2-3 years,"" Kotak Securities said.For Mahindra and Mahindra, Kotak Securities pegs 22 per cent returns on investments.""Given the strong order book on account of successful new launches, we expect the automotive segment to deliver a strong performance in the coming quarters,"" the brokerage report said, adding it expects mid-single-digit growth in tractor segment volumes.For Infosys, Kotak Securities said the IT services major will be at the forefront of driving the digital journey of clients.""Infosys' strength in managing the twin journeys of digital transformation and cost takeout will drive growth leadership,"" it noted.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/kotak-securities-picks-eight-stocks-sees-10-26-potential-returns/articleshow/104939355.cms,0

CEO Vaib,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.” ",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,2

Sony may send a letter stating tha,"The fate of the planned merger between Sony Group Corp’s India unit and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd may be known as early as next week, according to people familiar with the matter, as the companies face a looming deadline to resolve their standoff or scuttle a long-awaited deal to create a $10 billion media giant. Unless the two sides can agree on who’ll lead the merged entity and give the final touches to the merger, Sony is likely to send a letter next week to Zee saying the stipulated demands for the merger couldn’t be met, said the people, who asked not to be named as the information isn’t public. That could be the death knell for the deal since there won’t be enough time to tie all the loose ends by the formal December 21 deadline, the people said. Zee is insisting that its Chief Executive Officer Punit Goenka — also its founder’s son — will helm the new entity, as agreed in the pact signed in 2021, while Sony is wary of his appointment given a regulatory probe against Goenka, the people added. This has created an eleventh-hour tussle in the two-year-old merger plan that has already seen a fair share of drama and delays.A Zee representative, without commenting on the leadership issue, said in an emailed response that the company was “actively engaged” toward the timely completion of all prerequisites for the deal. Zee had already completed most of them and was in touch with Sony “on a regular basis,” he said. Sony’s representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment.The Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets regulator, alleged in June that the Mumbai-based media house faked the recovery of loans to cover private financing deals by its founder, Subhash Chandra. Chandra and his son, Goenka, “abused their position” and siphoned off funds, Sebi said in an interim order. While Goenka got a reprieve from an appellate authority against the Sebi order — it had barred him from being an executive or director position in a listed company — Sony still views the ongoing probe as an overhanging corporate governance issue, the people said. Local newspaper Mint first reported this impasse. Who blinks firstThe last-lap tussle is pushing the merger to the brink of collapse unless one of the partners blinks. The Sony-Zee deal sought to create India’s biggest entertainment company with the financial muscle to challenge global powerhouses, including Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., as well as local conglomerates such as Reliance Industries Ltd. Sony will own a 50.86% stake in the merged entity and Goenka’s family will own 3.99% if the deal goes through, with public shareholders in possession of the remaining stake, according to the 2021 agreement. Sony is not considering an extension of the December 21 deadline, the people said.To be sure, the proposed merger has received almost all regulatory approvals and can still be closed if the two sides expeditiously resolve their issues. They can also request India’s company court for extending the merger deadline. If closed, the transaction will help expand Sony’s media business in the world’s most populous country, with over 75 television channels and a market share of 37%, ahead of Disney-owned Star’s 24%, according to a note from brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.Consolidation is already heating up in the sector with Reliance, which tried to buy out Zee earlier, in advanced talks to buyout Walt Disney Co’s India operations, Bloomberg News reported last month.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sony-zee-merger-risks-collapse-ahead-of-deadline-over-ceo-drama/articleshow/105551588.cms,1

Located 35 kilometres off the coast of Andhra Pradesh in water depths ranging from 300-3,200 metres, the discoveries in the block are divided into Cluster-1, 2 and 3. Cluster 2 is being put to production first.""Cluster-I consists of three discoveries. FDPs of 2 discoveries were approved in 2019. This project is currently in the development stage,"" he said. ""In Cluster-II, commercial production from one gas field has already commenced from March 2020 and commercial production of crude oil is scheduled for May 2024. The project is likely to achieve full completion by 2024.""In Cluster-III, there is one ultra-deep water gas discovery which would be the second deepest hydrocarbon discovery in the world, when monetised. ""The FDP is scheduled to be submitted by January 2026,"" he said.As per original plans, oil production from Cluster-II should have begun by November 2021, but was delayed because of the pandemic. Thereafter, ONGC set May 2023 as the first Cluster-2 oil production deadline but then extended it to August 2023, then to September 2023, and finally, October 2023.None of the deadlines were met and last month ONGC Director (Production) Pankaj Kumar had stated that oil production would start within November but the company is yet to give an update on it.Teli said after the discoveries are made in any block, operators are required to submit a field development plan (FDP) for approval by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH). ""Thereafter, the operator commences production facility development followed by testing and commercial production,"" he added.ONGC had proposed a FDP for Cluster-II in April 2018, with an estimated capital expenditure of USD 5.07 billion and operational expenditure of USD 5.12 billion over a field life of 16 years.The Cluster-II field is divided into two blocks namely 2A and 2B, which as per the original investment decision were expected to produce 23.52 million metric tonnes of oil and 50.70 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas over the life of the field.Cluster 2A was estimated to contain reserves of 94.26 million tonnes of crude oil and 21.75 bcm of associated gas, while Cluster 2B is estimated to host 51.98 bcm of gas reserves.Cluster 2A was anticipated to produce 77,305 barrels of oil per day (bopd) and associated gas at a rate of 3.81 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) over 15 years.Cluster 2B is expected to produce free gas of 12.75 mmscmd from eight wells and has a 16-year life.But ONGC is projecting a lower output - 45,000 bpd of oil and up to 2.5 mmscmd from Cluster 2A and around 9 mmscmd from Cluster 2B.

The initiative aims to foster the development of an ecosystem where vendor partners can aggregate agricultural residue as raw material for Reliance's CBG production plants throughout India.In a press release, the company highlighted the significant volume of agricultural residue in India, often disposed of through burning due to a lack of processing infrastructure and logistical support. The existing agricultural residue supply chain has been disorganized, with farmers and aggregators lacking proper incentives and financial support.Reliance Industries views this initiative as a crucial element in its net-zero roadmap. The company intends to invest nationwide to produce CBG as an eco-friendly alternative to imported compressed natural gas (CNG) and other fossil fuels, positioning India as a notable bio-fuel source. While CBG technology has advanced, commercialization necessitates new infrastructure and engagement with the value chain, involving farmers across various states, the company release said.Harindra K Tripathi, head of Bio-energy Business at Reliance Industries, emphasized the significance of CBG plants in utilizing organic waste, a major contributor to air pollution. ""Beyond mitigating carbon emissions, the CBG plants will also contribute to the production of Fermented Organic Manure (FOM), enhancing soil fertility and reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers over time,"" Tripathi said.Rajat Verma, managing director and head of Institutional Banking at DBS Bank India, underscored the importance of India's green energy sector in the country's net-zero strategy. He commended Reliance Industries' bold initiative and emphasized the pivotal role of transition financing in enabling businesses to adopt and scale innovative technologies for decarbonization. Over the next five years, Reliance plans to establish approximately 100 CBG plants, consuming over 5.5 million tonnes per annum of agricultural residue and organic waste. This initiative is projected to result in a yearly reduction of nearly 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

The market capitalization of listed government assets almost doubled to around Rs 46.4 lakh crore for the final 10,000 points addition to Sensex.

This reflects investor confidence in the government's reforms-driven agenda for state companies in sectors such as banking, insurance, infrastructure, and manufacturing.

However, some wonder if OpenAI has led to the end of the Metav","The hype around OpenAI refuses to die away. It has moved far away from being marked as ‘a trend’ to become an integral part of people’s lives in a very tangible way. In fact, it’s amazing to see the possibilities individuals are exploring to find solutions from the offerings of OpenAI. Not so interestingly, many people believe this ‘new-tech’ has heralded the end of a tech that was making all the noise not so long back. Hence the frequently asked question, ‘Has OpenAI marked the end of Metaverse?’What we must remember about technology is that it's not a zero-sum game; it thrives on collaboration. The coalescence of old and new tech is what makes our reliance on technology a dynamic force. Emerging innovations don't necessarily render older ones obsolete.Breaking the mythA general perception points toward a ‘sudden’ emergence and rise of OpenAI. For decades, Generative AI has been consistently taking steps to find its footing. Machine Learning has already found its way into business processes. So, one would ask, ‘Why did it come today?’Despite its efficacy, Gen-AI needed something that it until today had struggled to master: context. Unlike human communication, technology thrives on binaries. So, for years, tech developers were busy feeding AI tools, context.Unlike metaverse, which seemed like a lucrative idea, Gen-AI had a foundation of decades to improve and thrive upon consistently.Access & Value-Added ResponsibilityIn terms of technological advancements, there is a verdict usually among the masses that divides them. When Metaverse made its entry, there were skeptics and there were optimists. However, I witnessed during the growth of OpenAI, that the two roles were replaced by: early users and latecomers.Based on a freemium model, ChatGPT’s easy interface and the ability to excite with results captured the attention of millions on a daily basis. When people witnessed the firsthand experience of automation, it became a revelation for them.Many saw in it, ease of work, while certain sections were left in a frenzy, ‘What if AI replaces us?’ Nonetheless, this immediacy of returns from AI, compared to the Metaverse, was enough to spark the growth journey for OpenAI.Community Engagement In A World Seeking AI SolutionsOpenAI actively engaged with its user community for feedback and improvement. This iterative process allowed the system to continuously learn and adapt, making it more valuable and accurate over time.Moreover, OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT coincided with a growing demand for AI-driven solutions to streamline work processes and enhance communication. This alignment with current needs in various industries contributed to its rapid growth.Why ‘AI and Metaverse’ & not ‘AI vs Metaverse’?I believe Metaverse is yet to find its value and its place. It may at present feel like clay moulded into uneven shapes but with time and resources, it will fall into a shape that fits in.The 'AI and Metaverse' approach acknowledges that AI has a pivotal role to play within the Metaverse framework. The creative front led by AI and automation can seamlessly pivot the virtual world toward being more natural and intelligent. Similarly, the Metaverse can serve as a valuable testing ground for AI advancements, allowing them to evolve and mature in a context that mirrors the complexities of real-world interactions.Fostering a collaborative perspective encourages innovation on multiple fronts. The next step…In a world where innovation is driven by collaboration, we can witness AI assisting in the creation of personalized and interactive Metaverse environments. Simultaneously, the Metaverse can serve as a fertile ground for AI to grasp and adapt to the intricacies of human behaviour and interaction.By fostering this harmonious relationship, we set the stage for a technological future that transcends the limitations of individual technologies and embraces their collective potential.By Piyush Jha, managing director & head – India & APAC, GlobalLogic",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/technology-is-not-a-zero-sum-game/articleshow/106355515.cms,2

Leaving school at 16, he navigated from humble beginnings as a clerk, fuelled by an unwavering ambition. From spice trading to textiles, each step became a calculated leap, defying naysayers and defying logic. Recognizing opportunities, he defied limitations, venturing into textiles, then pioneering petrochemicals and telecom, building a behemoth – Reliance Industries – from scratch. His audacious vision, relentless drive, and instinctual grasp of market needs transformed him from a small-town boy into a titan of Indian industry, forever etching his name in the nation's entrepreneurial tapestry.Discover these 10 valuable life lessons from Dhirubhai Ambani's experiences that can inspire and offer guidance to students on their journey.1. Success unbounded by background and resourcesBorn in a modest family in Gujarat, Dhirubhai left school at 16 to work as a clerk. Despite limited formal education, his ambition and hard work led him to found Reliance Industries, which transformed into a multi-billion dollar conglomerate spanning petrochemicals, telecom, retail, and more. This story teaches us that success is not limited by our background or resources. With dedication, perseverance, and a clear vision, even seemingly insurmountable obstacles can be overcome.2. Identify needs, create opportunities for successDhirubhai had a knack for spotting opportunities. He recognized the need for quality textiles in India after independence and ventured into that sector, capitalizing on the booming market. This led to the creation of Reliance Textile Industries, a major turning point in his journey. This example highlights the importance of being observant and identifying gaps in the market. By understanding people's needs and proactively addressing them, you can create your own opportunities for success.3. Embrace innovationsDhirubhai wasn't afraid to challenge the status quo. He adopted innovative strategies like backward integration, gaining control over raw materials and production processes, giving Reliance a significant edge. This not only reduced costs but also ensured quality control throughout the supply chain. This lesson emphasizes the importance of thinking outside the box and not being afraid to disrupt traditional methods. By embracing innovation and staying ahead of the curve, you can gain a competitive advantage and achieve remarkable results.4. Teamwork fuels successDhirubhai understood the power of teamwork. He empowered his employees, fostered a culture of entrepreneurship within Reliance, and built a strong team of professionals who shared his vision. This collaborative approach played a crucial role in Reliance's growth and success. This example teaches us the importance of surrounding ourselves with talented and supportive individuals. By building a strong team, delegating effectively, and empowering others, you can achieve more than you ever could alone.5. Wealth's true valueDhirubhai and his family have been recognized for their significant philanthropic contributions through the Reliance Foundation. Their focus areas include education, healthcare, rural development, and disaster relief, making a positive impact on millions of lives across India. This story reminds us that success should not be measured solely by wealth or personal achievements. Using our resources and influence to make a positive impact on the world can be equally, if not more, fulfilling.6. Never afraid to take risksIn the 1960s, Dhirubhai took a bold step by setting up a polyester yarn plant despite government scepticism. His gut feeling about the rising demand for synthetic fabrics proved correct, turning Reliance into a leader in the textile industry and establishing his reputation for being a shrewd risk-taker. Dhirubhai's daring venture into the polyester yarn plant teaches students the importance of trusting their instincts and taking calculated risks. Despite scepticism, his foresight and confidence in market trends propelled Reliance to success, emphasizing that well-thought-out risks can lead to significant achievements in the business world.7. Business value creativityIn 1982, Reliance faced challenges during a rights issue with partly convertible debentures. Dhirubhai countered a bearish attack by mobilizing a network of loyal traders to buy Reliance shares, eventually leading to a surge in the stock price. This incident, while controversial, showcased his innovative and aggressive business tactics. Dhirubhai's strategic response during the rights issue emphasizes the importance of adaptability and creativity in business. Students can learn that unconventional challenges may require out-of-the-box solutions, and strategic thinking can turn adversity into an opportunity. Additionally, the episode underscores the significance of building strong networks and leveraging relationships to navigate complex situations.8. Significance of mentorship in businessDhirubhai actively sought guidance from experienced individuals like Rasheed Ghadiali, a textile pioneer. Ghadiali's advice and connections proved invaluable in shaping Reliance's early growth. This episode highlights the importance of mentorship and seeking knowledge from experienced individuals, a lesson applicable to any field. From this students can learn the importance of seeking guidance and knowledge from experienced mentors in their chosen fields.9. Persistence and resilience lead to successIn 1986, Dhirubhai suffered a major stroke, raising concerns about Reliance's future. However, he displayed remarkable resilience and determination, gradually regaining control and returning to lead the company to further success. This story exemplifies the power of perseverance and overcoming adversity, inspiring those facing challenges in their own lives. Students can learn the invaluable lesson of perseverance and resilience from this narrative, inspiring them to navigate personal and professional obstacles with determination.10. Significance of visionary leadershipIn 2016, Dhirubhai's son, Mukesh Ambani, launched Reliance Jio, a disruptive venture offering affordable mobile data and voice services. This transformed India's telecommunications landscape, making internet access more accessible and paving the way for a digital revolution. While Dhirubhai wasn't directly involved, his vision and emphasis on innovation inspired this transformative move. From this, students can learn the significance of visionary leadership and embracing innovation. Dhirubhai's influence, even posthumously, showcases how fostering a culture of innovation can lead to groundbreaking changes in industries, providing a valuable lesson for aspiring leaders and entrepreneurs.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/dhirubhai-ambanis-92nd-birth-anniversary-10-lessons-every-student-should-learn-from-his-career-path/articleshow/106345794.cms,2

Ambani emphasised that Reliance Industries, which operates the world’s largest single-location oil refining complex and telecom networks across India, will never be complacent and will continue to disrupt markets.  “We are known for disrupting the market through constant innovation and reinvention. We have shown the courage to set the bar high and the ability to jump even higher to create new records,” Ambani said, addressing employees on Reliance Family Day, the birthday of group founder Dhirubhai Ambani.  He added that his oil-chemicals-telecom conglomerate is aiming to secure its place among global leaders in digital data platforms and artificial intelligence (AI) adoption.  “As India races ahead to become the world’s third-largest economy, an unprecedented opportunity awaits Reliance. Reliance can …. and Reliance will … grow to be among the Top 10 business conglomerates of the world. For this, we need to be laser-focused on three things,” he said.  Reliance started as a small textile manufacturing unit in Mumbai but then ventured into the petrochemical sector to provide feedstock for textiles, ultimately becoming the nation’s largest producer. Subsequently, it set up the largest oil refinery in the country and then expanded it to the world’s biggest single-location refining complex.  In 2005, it entered the retail sector and is now the largest operator of grocery stores, hypermarkets, and online retail in the country. In 2016, it launched the telecom service Jio, which quickly became the largest operator in India and the third largest in the world.  Today, Reliance is building giga-scale factories for new energy businesses and has also forayed into financial services.  Today, Reliance is building massive factories for new energy ventures and has also ventured into financial services.  “We have shown the courage to set the bar high and the ability to jump even higher to create new records. This is how Reliance has achieved perennial growth,” Ambani said.  On artificial intelligence (AI), Ambani said Reliance Industries must “boldly embrace data and AI to become better at decision-making and resource utilisation.”  “We need to be at the forefront of using data, with AI as an enabler for achieving a quantum jump in productivity and efficiency,” he said, adding that growth engines of Reliance – digital services, green and bio-energy, retail and consumer brands, O2C (oil-to ) and materials business, and health and life sciences — will have to complete this transformation by next year.  Reliance is India’s largest corporation by revenue, profit and market value.  Ambani asked employees to be ‘laser-focused’ on providing extreme value to customers through collaboration and systems improvement. “In the coming years, we must continue to strive even harder to develop products and services that no one has created ever before,” he said.  At the same time, the company’s actions must always win community trust, he said, adding that the group must continuously enrich competencies and capabilities.  “When all our businesses grow exponentially, we can contribute more to India’s inclusive prosperity and make the world a better place,” he said.  Ambani said his three key messages for the New Year are to consolidate Reliance’s place among global leaders in digital data platforms and AI adoption, consolidate its place among global leaders in talent enrichment, and secure its place among global leaders in institutional culture.  “As Reliance reinvents itself to become a unique new-age technology company, we need to boldly embrace data and AI to become better at decision-making and resource utilisation.  “In the era of digital platforms, data has become a new factor of production along with talent and money. We need to be at the forefront of using data, with AI as an enabler for achieving a quantum jump in productivity and efficiency,” he said.  All growth engines of Reliance -- digital services, green and bio-energy, retail and consumer brands, oil-to-chemicals (O2C) and materials business, and health and life sciences -- will have to complete this transformation by next year, he said.  “Furthermore, we should accelerate our efforts to become a pioneer in developing AI to address, at scale, India’s urgent national priorities in education, healthcare, agriculture, and employment creation,” he said.  To make Reliance an AI-immersive tech company, it needs to build the necessary talent, skill sets and competencies at all levels within the organisation, Ambani said. “We should expand and deepen our talent pool to be amongst the best in the world. Investment in talent brings higher returns than investment in machines,” he added.  On institutional culture, Ambani said the most important tenet of Reliance’s culture is to work with the founder’s mindset. “It means working with the ownership mindset.”  “Each and every one of you become an owner of Reliance when you own the founder’s purpose and passion,” he told employees.  For the younger generation joining the business, Ambani said, “Young leaders will commit mistakes. That’s for sure...But my advice to them is simple: Do not waste your energy on conducting a post-mortem on past mistakes. Rather, learn not to repeat the same mistakes.” Ambani said Reliance must be forever kept young by ensuring that the average age of all teams remains in the 30s.  He also advised the employees to “be bold, courageous and adventurous in pursuing your present and future goals.”  “Let me reiterate: The future of Reliance belongs to Akash, Isha, Anant and their generation,” he said, referring to his three children and also mentioning that at a time when Reliance is undergoing a Generational Transition, “I attach immense importance to further strengthening this unique Institutional Culture.”  Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

The investment highlights the positive turnaround of BookMyShow after facing challenges during the Covid-19 pandemic.","KKR to invest in BookMyShow? Private equity firm KKR is in advanced negotiations to invest a significant amount for a minority stake in Reliance Industries Ltd-backed BookMyShow (BMS), a popular online platform for booking tickets and organizing events.The investment is expected to be in the range of Rs 2,087-2,505 crore ($250-300 million) and will be made through a secondary share sale by existing financial investors, according to an ET report. The valuation of BMS is estimated to be around Rs 7,500 crore ($900 million). This possible investment by KKR highlights the positive turnaround of BMS after facing challenges during the Covid-19 pandemic. BMS, which is operated by Bigtree Entertainment, is set to achieve its largest fund-raising round. The largest shareholder of BMS is Reliance unit Network18, holding a 37% stake. Other existing investors include Accel, Elevation Capital, Stripes Group, and TPG Growth.In the last fundraise round in 2018, TPG Growth and other investors injected $100 million (Rs 670 crore) into BMS.

The company’s stock has delivered a strong performance.  Since the low of October 2023, the company’s stock has surged 23 percent on the NSE, ending trading at Rs 2,734.9 on January 19.  Here are 10 key things from the earnings:  1) Net Profit  Reliance’s consolidated net profit grew by 10.9 percent on-year to Rs 19,641 crore for the December quarter of the current financial year 2023-24.  The major drivers for profitability were the consumer businesses and the oil &amp;amp; gas segment.  2) Revenue  Consolidated revenue for the third quarter came in at Rs 2.48 lakh crore, growing 3.2 percent from the year-ago period, supported by continued growth momentum in consumer businesses.  3) Operating Performance  Reliance’s quarterly EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased by 16.7 percent on-year to Rs 44,678 crore, led by growth across all businesses.  The double-digit growth in consolidated EBITDA was driven by 31.1 percent growth in Reliance Retail Ventures and 49.6 percent jump in oil &amp;amp; gas.  The oil-telecom-to-retail giant expanded its consolidated EBITDA margin to 18 percent for the quarter, up by 210 basis points over the corresponding period last fiscal.  4) Jio Platforms  Jio Platforms registered a strong 11.6 percent on-year growth in net profit at Rs 5,445 crore for the quarter, while the revenue was at a record high of Rs 32,510 crore, growing 11.4 percent YoY, with ARPU (average revenue per user) increasing 2 percent YoY to Rs 181.7 with better subscriber mix partially offset by unlimited data allowance on 5G network.  The 5G rollout accelerated the subscriber addition momentum. Jio continued to outpace the competition, with 11.2 million net additions in Q3FY24, taking the subscriber base to 470.9 million, while the customer engagement on the Jio network remained strong, with total data and voice traffic increasing 31.5 percent to 38.1 billion GB, and 7.9 percent to 1.37 trillion minutes, respectively, from a year earlier.  The company has rolled out the Jio True 5G network across India ahead of schedule. About 90 million subscribers have been migrated to Jio’s 5G network. “The strong uptake of the JioBharat phone and JioAirFiber services has resulted in the continued expansion of Jio’s subscriber base, contributing to the stellar growth numbers of the digital services business,” Mukesh D Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, said. 5) Reliance Retail  Further, the retail segment has also delivered an impressive financial performance with its rapidly expanding physical as well as digital footprint.  Reliance Retail, too, posted a record quarterly revenue of Rs 83,063 crore, increasing 22.8 percent from the year-ago period, driven by grocery, fashion &amp;amp; lifestyle and consumer electronics businesses.  The segment’s net profit jumped 31.9 percent to Rs 3,165 crore for the quarter, while the EBITDA margin expanded by 50 basis points to 8.4 percent, led by operating leverage and continued focus on cost management.  Reliance Retail has expanded its store network, opening 252 new stores, taking the total count to 18,774 stores, while it recorded footfalls of over 282 million across formats, a growth of 40.3 percent from a year earlier.  6) Oil &amp;amp; Gas  The oil &amp;amp; gas business (exploration and production segment) also recorded healthy performance for the quarter with a massive 50.2 percent on-year growth in revenue at Rs 6,719 crore, mainly on account of higher volumes partly offset by lower price realisation from KG D6 Field.  Block KG D6 is currently producing around 30 MMSCMD gas and around 21,000 barrels of oil or condensate, the company said, adding the segment posted the highest-ever quarterly EBITDA at Rs 5,804 crore.  The average price realised for KG D6 gas was $9.66/MMBTU (metric million British thermal unit) in Q3FY24 against $11.32 in Q3FY23, while the average price realised for CBM gas was $15.55 per MMBTU against $20.92 during the same period. “KG D6 is now contributing 30 percent of India’s gas production, fueling its transition towards a greener and cleaner tomorrow,” Ambani said. 7) Oil to Chemicals (O2C)  The O2C segment delivered resilient performance aided by operational flexibility and strong domestic demand.  The oil-to-chemicals segment quarterly revenue fell 2.4 percent on-year to Rs 1.41 lakh crore primarily due to lower price realisation led by a 5.3 percent decline in average Brent crude oil prices from a year earlier.  The O2C EBITDA for the quarter marginally increased by 1 percent to Rs 14,064 crore led by higher gasoline cracks and advantageous feedstock sourcing. This was partially offset by lower downstream chemical margins and planned maintenance and inspection shutdown, Reliance said, adding the margin expanded by 40 basis points to 10 percent for the quarter.  The company's  planned maintenance and inspection shutdown of CDU, FCCU, delayed coking and ROGC complex impacted yields and profitability. O2C EBITDA would have been higher on YoY and comparable on QoQ basis if all major units had been available during the quarter.”  8) New Energy Business  The New Energy Giga Complex is all set to be commissioned in the second half of CY24. “I am confident that Reliance’s New Energy business will play a pivotal role in the global movement for adoption of cleaner fuels,” Ambani said. 9) Media Business  The media business delivered strong operating performance across verticals. TV News business revenue was up 23 percent from a year earlier, driven by the strong growth in advertising revenue across clusters. Digital News business delivered 20 percent growth in revenue, driven by intellectual property events and video monetisation across digital platforms.  10) Increase in tax cost and debt on books  Tax expenses for the quarter ended December increased by 22.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 6,345 crore, while the depreciation jumped by 26.7 percent to Rs 12,903 crore for the quarter on expanded asset base across all the businesses, higher network utilisation in the digital services business and ramp-up in upstream production.  The company's finance costs during the quarter increased by 11.3 percent to Rs 5,789 crore compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to higher loan balances and higher interest rates.  The outstanding debt on its books at the end of December FY24 stood at Rs 3,11,743 crore, increasing from Rs 3,03,530 crore at the end of December FY23, while the net debt rose to Rs 1,19,372 crore, from Rs 1,10,248 crore during the same period.  However, the net debt to EBITDA ratio improved to 0.67 at the end of the December quarter, from 0.72 as of the same period last year.  Reliance reported capital expenditure for the December quarter at Rs 30,102 crore with investments in pan-India 5G rollout, expansion of retail infrastructure and new energy business. The capital expenditure in the same quarter last year was Rs 37,599 crore.  Disclaimer: MoneyControl is a part of the Network18 group.

Here's what you need to know.","Zee Entertainment share price today: Shares of Zee Entertainment witnessed a significant and closed the down 32.73% on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The shares reached the lower circuit of Rs 152.50 intraday. This drop came in the wake of brokerages downgrading the media stock, reacting to the abrupt end of the prolonged drama surrounding the expected $10-billion merger with Sony.With the merger officially called off, brokerages such as CLSA have swiftly downgraded Zee from a ""BUY"" to a ""SELL,"" revising the target price from Rs 300 to Rs 198, according to an ET report. The sector is expected to witness increased competition, especially with the reported merger of Reliance and Disney Star.Analysts predict that Zee's near-term valuation will remain subdued due to various factors, including Sony seeking a termination fee, uncertainties about Zee's new strategy and partners, and the actions of its minority stakeholders. 107064850Nuvama has adjusted its FY25E/26E EPS on Zee, reducing it by 16%/24%, and downgraded the stock to ""reduce"" with a target price of Rs 190. Elara and Motilal Oswal have also downgraded Zee, setting target prices of Rs 170 and Rs 200, respectively.Motilal Oswal expressed concerns about the lack of clarity on Zee's future direction. The company's recovery in earnings is not expected in the near term, and uncertainties regarding the litigation with Sony further complicate matters, it said.Facing fierce competition from digital media and the potential threat from the RIL-Disney merger, Zee has reported muted growth and profitability in the past two years. Losses in the OTT segment and lower growth in the linear TV segment have contributed to a dip in the EBITDA margin to 10.7%. 107067209Elara was quoted saying that the possibility of Zee's target price falling to as low as Rs 130 if the company honors its contract with Disney for the sub-franchise of ICC tournaments on linear TV. The broadcasting business and OTT segment were valued at 10x one-year forward P/E and 3.0x one-year forward EV/sales, respectively, Elara said.In a shifting industry landscape towards OTT, Zee5 is perceived to be on weak footing, competing against strong players like Disney, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Network18 led by Reliance Industries. Amidst the turmoil, Sony is seeking a termination fee of $90 million from Zee, leading to a legal dispute as Zee refutes the claims and plans to contest them in arbitration proceedings.Experts advise avoiding Zee shares - here’s whyAnalysts have warned against buying shares in the hopes of the price bottoming out during the current market downturn, following the failed merger with Sony. This merger was seen as a potential lifeline for Zee, which is grappling with ongoing crises and a decline in market share. 107074334In the last month, Zee's stock has dropped by 15%, contrasting with the 1% gain in the Nifty index, primarily due to uncertainties related to the unsuccessful merger. After the deal announcement in December 2021, Zee shares had surged from around Rs 170 to about Rs 370.As of December 2023, foreign institutional investors held 28.19% of the company, domestic institutional investors held 43.42%, and retail investors had 24.24%. Notable shareholders, such as ICICI Prudential, Nippon India, and HDFC MF, owned stakes ranging from 5.26% to 7.25%, and Life Insurance Corporation of India held 5.12%.The failure of the merger has broader implications, as it was considered advantageous for both Zee and Sony, particularly in light of industry dynamics following the Disney-Viacom merger. Zee may face near-term downgrades, affecting both shareholders and its overall position.Corporate governance firms attribute the deal breakdown to the promoters and the board. Shriram Subramanian, Founder and Managing Director of InGovern Research Services, points out that frustrated public shareholders have the right to hold the board accountable. Shareholders may seek change by calling an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) to address concerns.Recent reports indicate that institutional investors, including Life Insurance Corporation, have written to the Securities and Exchange Board of India, expressing concerns about the stalemate in the merger talks with the Sony Group adversely affecting minority shareholders.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/steep-fall-zee-entertainment-shares-drop-2818-following-sonys-merger-termination-heres-what-experts-have-advised/articleshow/107074249.cms,1

The stock also got a boost from a likely decline in valuation of Walt Disney Inc.’s India unit, a target of a potential merger for the Mumbai-based conglomerate.“Definitely, there is optimism around refining margins picking up further for the energy business” because of the Red Sea tensions, said Hemang Khanna, vice president at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities India Pvt. The impact of the crisis on product margins will “flow immediately into Reliance’s earnings” during the quarter ending in March, he said. With Russian oil supplies to India still largely unaffected by the Houthi attacks on cargo vessels in the Red Sea, Reliance, one of the biggest buyers of Russian crude, is gaining from the widening diesel margins. Refinery margins for producing gasoil over Dubai crude in Asia have risen to $25.53 per barrel from $20 per barrel a month ago, according to third party data compiled by Bloomberg.The rally has pushed up Reliance’s valuation to 23.8 times one-year forward earnings. That’s more than one standard deviation above the five-year average and could pose a hurdle to further gains over the short term.

The Nifty 50 during the last week settled at 21,353 level, while the Nifty Midcap 100 index was down 1.8 percent and Smallcap 100 index dropped 0.71 percent during the week.  &quot;When examined on a broader scale, a head and shoulders pattern confirms a bearish trend. This does not bode well for the bulls, suggesting potential challenges in the short term,&quot; Sameet Chavan, head of research for technical derivatives at Angel One, said.  He feels the Budget week is known for volatility, and &quot;considering the above formation we lean towards the bearish side&quot;.  In this scenario, the levels to monitor are around the psychological mark of 21,000, coinciding with 50SMA, and in the case of any negative surprises, the Nifty may decline towards 20,800 or even towards the bullish gap of 20,500, while on the flip side, resistance is anticipated, with 21,500 and the last week's high of 21,750 seen as formidable obstacles before Nifty targets the recent landmark high of around 22,100, he said.

Nifty gained 385 points or 1.8% to close at 21,738 points. Some short-covering by speculators to minimise their losses also added to the gains in the sensex and Nifty during the late hours, market players said. Monday's strong gains came despite rising crude oil prices on the back of an attack on a US defence base in Jordan by suspected Iran-backed militants.For RIL, it was the best daily gain in about three years, which also took its market capitalisation closer to the Rs 20-lakh-crore mark. At Rs 19.6 lakh crore, it's the most valued company in India by some distance with TCS at the second spot with a Rs 13.9-lakh-crore market cap. If RIL breaks above the Rs 20-lakh-crore market cap value, it will be the first Indian company to reach that mark. HDFC Bank stock, which suffered losses last week also made a comeback with 1.4% gain. It's only the third time that the sensex has surged over 1,000 points in the last 12 months. 107241254Gains in other Asian markets also helped investor sentiment on Dalal Street which came mainly on renewed expectations that the US central Bank would start cutting interest rates in the world's largest economy by the middle of the year. Such a cut could exert downward pressure on most other large economies of the world, other than Japan, to reduce rates, economists and analysts said.The day's gains in the domestic market made investors richer by Rs 5.5 lakh crore with BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 383.1 lakh crore, an all-time peak. However, it came despite strong foreign fund participation while buying by domestic institutions was nothing extraordinary. End-of-the-session data on BSE showed that foreign funds were net buyers at Rs 110 crore while domestic institutions were net buyers at Rs 3,221 crore.According to Vinod Nair of Geojit Financial Services, the domestic market underwent an upturn as the recent selloff and positive Asian peers provided an opportunity to accumulate quality stocks. ""Despite premium valuations, confidence is upheld among investors due to the optimistic environment surrounding the interim budget and recent set of results aligning with forecasts. Globally, the upcoming US Fed policy stands out as a crucial factor. While a rate cut by the FOMC is unlikely, investors will eagerly monitor their commentary to get cues on future rate paths.""

Not really, say analysts","On January 29, the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) single-handedly contributed to a 38 percent surge in the Nifty 50 market capitalisation.  ","A 6 percent rally in Reliance Industries on January 29 does not really indicate a comeback for largecap stocks, analysts told Moneycontrol. Money is simply flowing from one largecap to another as foreign investors are recasting their portfolios, they argued.  On January 29, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) alone contributed to a 38 percent surge in the Nifty 50 market capitalisation, while ONGC, Adani Enterprises, Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro, HDFC Bank and Coal India together contributed over 26 percent to the rally.  &quot;Reliance benefits from three things: Zee-Sony merger fallout, refining margins shaping well, and new energy vertical scaling up. It is a very stock-specific move,&quot; said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Direct.  Also Read: RIL rally triggered by funds taking refuge in ‘strong stock’ to hedge against short positions  &quot;I don't think the Reliance move indicates a trend reversal for largecaps, though largecaps are a lot more attractive than midcaps from a risk-reward perspective. Till the results season pans out, it will be a lot of stock-specific moves, I believe,&quot; Pandey said.  RIL strong, other heavyweights weak  The sheer weight of Reliance Industries on the Nifty 50, which was 9.2 percent as of end-December, means that any further rally in the stock should propel the benchmark index further, in theory. But, other heavyweights like HDFC Bank and TCS are not showing enough strength for the index to move forward decisively, said analysts.  HDFC Bank is down 14 percent in the past one month while TCS is up barely 0.16 percent. As of December-end, HDFC Bank had 13.52 percent weightage on the index, TCS had 4.5 percent.  HDFC Bank shares have seen a sharp sell-off after its Q3 FY24 results. The bank reported a key miss in net interest margins (NIM) due to the low deposit growth and higher cost of funds. Higher provisions and decadal low earnings per share (EPS) growth in Q3 are also contributing to the decline in shares.  All IT companies, including TCS and Infosys, continued to post soft numbers in Q3.  Also Read: HDFC Bank faces tough task to deliver both on margins and costs: Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie  On the other hand, the recent surge in Singapore GRMs (gross refining margins) indicates a positive outlook for RIL's oil-to-chemicals business, said independent analyst Prakash Diwan.  This marks a valuation reset for RIL, which is currently under-owned by FIIs, he said. &quot;As FIIs sell HDFC Bank, IT and FMCG stocks due to bleak outlook, they will redirect funds elsewhere. And, RIL will be a big beneficiary. FIIs can move out of some stocks but cannot move out of Indian markets as a whole, so money is now going to RIL,&quot; Diwan added.  Where is Nifty headed next?  With the Interim Budget just a couple of months away, the Q3 results season still playing out, and valuations slightly out of the comfort zone, the Nifty 50 is expected to remain rangebound.  Going ahead, similar erratic movements may persist ahead of key events, said analysts at Angel One. Immediate resistance for the Nifty is apparent around the 21,850 - 21,950 zone, while immediate support has shifted higher towards the 21,600-21,550 zone.

The stock jumped 6 percent to Rs 3,415 and traded well above all key moving averages.  Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:  Reliance Industries  It is rare to see this stock rally by more than 7 percent in single day. Reliance Industries surpassed its previous record highs of Rs 2,792 level and achieved fresh record highs of Rs 2,905 level which keeps the tone positive for the stock.  Parabolic Sar dots has started to form below the price which is also suggesting that short term bias is bullish. Stochastic RSI (relative strength index) is also confirming the bullish bias as it has given bullish crossover. Stock has shown sharp upside move, buy on dips seems to be a prudent strategy.  In short, Reliance is bullish. Buy on dips can be used to ride the trend as far as price hold Rs 2,790 on the downside for further upside levels of Rs 3,000.    PFC  On the below chart, we can see that stock has given breakout of the rectangular pattern, indicating up move post accumulation. In the previous session, price has closed above Rs 432 with increase in volume. This confirms breakout of the trading range.  Along with this, MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has also shown a bullish crossover which is acting as a double confirmation.  In short, trend for PFC looks positive. Use dips towards Rs 432 as a buying opportunity with the target of Rs 465 as long as Rs 410 holds on the downside.    MCX India  MCX price gave breakout from consolidation technical pattern which keeps the tone positive. Bollinger Bands expansion suggest that momentum is likely to continue on upside in next few trading sessions.  MACD has confirmed the positive bias with a bullish crossover, aligning with the breakout. The overall trend looks bullish as far as price hold Rs 3,240 on the downside.  In short, MCX is bullish. Dips can be used as buying opportunity for the targets of Rs 3,550 as far as price is holding Rs 3,300 on the downside.

This article discusses the compliance burden, business realities, and the need for intelligible disclosures.","MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi is reviewing a requirement for listed companies to disclose all penalties imposed by authorities, even an insignificant amount, which increases the compliance burden.The regulator in July 2023 mandated disclosure of all penalties to stock exchanges irrespective of the amount. Earlier, companies could user their discretion in disclosing fines. ""An amendment by Sebi, mandating the disclosure of penalties without any materiality threshold epitomises regulatory overreach and underscores a disconnect with practical business realities,"" said Katalyst Advisors' executive director Binoy Parikh.For instance, Reliance Industries, India's most valued company at nearly Rs 20 lakh crore, said that it was fined Rs 62,016 under the GST Act. For RIL, the penalty comprised 0.000000314% of its market capitalisation. Yes Bank, which has a market capitalisation of Rs 70,034 crore, said that it was fined Rs 150 by RBI for ""discrepancies observed during the processing of soiled notes remitted by it to the central bank"". Sapphire Foods, which operates KFC in India, disclosed that it was fined Rs 10,000 by Dehradun's municipal council for ""non-availability of a dustbin"" outside one of its stores in the city. 107272333The penalties amount to a drop in the ocean for big businesses. All three companies, Yes Bank, Sapphire Foods, and RIL, confirmed there was no material impact on their financials or operations due to the said civil penalties.Sources said a Sebi committee, headed by former Sebi member S K Mohanty, is looking at removing unnecessary disclosure requirements related to monetary penalties to enable 'ease of doing business' for companies. The committee is expected to submit a report on this to the regulator soon. An email sent to Sebi didn't elicit any response.When high market cap companies are compelled to report even the tiniest penalties, they ""not only border on the absurd but also unnecessarily inflates compliance burden"", said Parikh. ""This may lead to an overload of trivial information, obscuring truly significant disclosures and undermining the very purpose of transparent corporate governance. Such regulations should align with the principle of materiality to ensure the focus remains on information that is truly impactful to investors,"" he added.""While it is an important step for a 'disclosure-based regime' and to strengthen the confidence of market participants, we should be mindful of 'over-information' which may not contribute to any real price re-discovery or may not be of relevance to lay market participants, who may not have the wherewithal to comprehensively assess the impact of a venial event/ order,"" said Bodhi Legal's founder Robin Shah.""A holistic mechanism ought to be devised to ensure that the content of the disclosure is intelligible to market participants, for them, to rationally respond to a particular event while making an informed decision and at the same time should not be burdensome to the companies,"" Shah added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-to-review-norms-for-penalty-disclosure-compliance-burden-and-business-realities/articleshow/107272123.cms,2

The valuation of Disney's India unit is sharply lower than the $15-$16 billion estimated when Disney acquired it in 2019. Disney's TV and streaming business in India has struggled over the years, with its digital platform facing a user exodus in stiff competition over cricket streaming with Ambani's platform. The deal will strengthen Reliance's hold over India's $28 billion media and entertainment market, especially after a separate $10 billion merger deal between Japan's Sony and India's Zee Entertainment collapsed last week.  The three sources said Bodhi Tree, a joint venture between James Murdoch and former top Disney executive, Uday Shankar, is also set to take a stake of around 9% in the new merged entity. Disney will hold around 40%. Reliance, Disney and Bodhi Tree did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Reliance and Disney, which each have a streaming service as well as 120 television channels between them, have been in talks for months to create an entertainment superpower in the world's most populous nation.  Under the deal being discussed, Viacom18, the broadcast division of Ambani's Reliance Industries, will merge with Disney's India businesses. Viacom18's shareholders include Paramount Global as well as Bodhi Tree, which invested $500 million in the Indian company last April. Shankar also serves on Viacom18's board. Two of the sources said the final percentage stake numbers could change. The sources declined to be identified because the talks are confidential. A deal could be closed by mid-February, the sources said. One of the executives said Viacom18 was also likely to infuse some cash in the merged entity. The third source said the deal talks were in advanced stages and some tax related matters were still being ironed out, though broad contours were almost finalised.  Antitrust and Cricket rights A Disney-Reliance merger could face many antitrust challenges due to the market power they could wield, especially as Sony and Zee were close to a separate merged entity in India.  Those regulatory hurdles may now ease. ""With the collapse of the Zee-Sony merger, the market will now be less concentrated, making it easier for Disney-Reliance,"" said Karan Singh Chandhiok, head of competition law at Indian law firm Chandhiok & Mahajan. In India, despite its large population with growing incomes, the Burbank-headquartered entertainment giant has struggled to make money. Its streaming service makes less than a tenth of its Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) there compared to the United States and other international markets. The US firm's streaming service lost nearly 34% of its subscribers between October 2022 and August 2023, as Ambani started offering free cricket on his new streaming platform after out-bidding Disney for the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament rights.  Several top Disney India executives have joined Viacom18 in recent months. Disney misjudged Indians' willingness to pay, Disney sources have said, and the company recently changed tack by offering free cricket on smartphones, hoping the strategy will boost advertising revenue and offset the impact of a subscriber exodus, Reuters reported.  In November, Disney CEO Bob Iger said Disney's TV channels were doing well in India, but other parts of the business were struggling and it was seeking to ""improve the bottom line.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-bodhi-tree-set-for-60-stake-in-disney-india-merger-sources/articleshow/107328442.cms,1

An important event coming up is the RBI meeting on 8th. But no positive triggers like a rate cut are likely from the RBI meeting,  said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. The positive takeaway is that the U.S. economy is doing surprisingly well and a sharp global slowdown triggered by a possible US recession is very unlikely. This, along with declining inflation in the US can support global equity markets,  Vijayakumar added.Mandar Bhojane, Choice Broking, said,  The Nifty index has formed a double top pattern on the daily chart, signaling a potential cautious stance for traders. The resistance level is identified at 22,200, and a decisive break above this on a closing basis could invalidate the bearish outlook. Conversely, the support for the index is situated at 21,600, coinciding with its 20-day moving average (20 DMA). A breach below this support level might intensify selling pressure in the market.

The good news that the economy is doing better-than-expected and a GDP growth projection of 7% and CPI inflation of 4.5% for FY 25 was ignored,  said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. FII selling and bear onslaught are unlikely to take the market down significantly. There will be strong buying on dips. The sustained flows into mutual funds which are gathering momentum will enable the DIIs to buy aggressively. A good investment strategy now would be to buy the bluechips which FIIs are selling,  Vijayakumar suggested.Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities, said,  Nifty could now face resistance at 22053 while 21448 could offer support in the near term.

This mandate will result in the cancellation of approximately 40 flights, impacting airlines like IndiGo and Air India. Additionally, the extension of the curfew on business jets has drawn criticism from corporate giants.","The government has asked Mumbai airport to reduce the number of scheduled flights and restrict the movement of business jets during rush hours in a bid to reduce congestion and improve on-time departures. The move will force airlines to cut some 40 flights and hit operations of private jets which is used by some of the country's top business houses. The Airport Authority of India, which handles air navigation services, has asked the airport to reduce aircraft movement from 46 to 44 during rush hour and from 44 to 42 during non-peak hours.The direction to reduce the number of flights will force airlines to cut around 40 flights from the middle of this week, industry executives familiar with the matter said. IndiGo, which operates the highest number of flights, will have to reduce 18 flights while the Air India group including Vistara will have to cut 17, executives said.Simultaneously, the curfew on operation of business jets has been extended from four hours to eight hours, leading to protests from top corporate groups such as Reliance Industries, JSW and the Mahindra group.Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), which operates the airport, didn’t comment till press time.The airport, owned by the Adani group, is the second busiest in the country after Delhi and sees heavy movement of business jets. It operates more flights than any airport with a single runway and in December, handled its highest-monthly traffic of 4.88 million passengers.People aware of the development said that the decision was taken after civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia raised concerns over the plummeting on-time departure numbers at the airport.107639301Senior air traffic controllers termed the leading cause of delay to overscheduling by airlines amid increasing demand for air travel this year.“Runway capacity is the sum of multiple things like availability of infrastructure such as parking stands and the time taken by the aircraft to vacate the runway. The airport had given slots to airlines considering the peak handling capacity. But for instance, if an aircraft is pushing back from one bay, the aircraft in the adjacent parking bay cannot move despite being ready to take off,” a government official said. “Also, in a city like Mumbai, there are multiple unscheduled movements like aircraft of government and business houses which sometimes delays scheduled flights.”He added that the government has also asked airports that from the upcoming summer schedule, they should factor in unforeseen circumstances while forecasting peak hour capacity.Airline network planners said that such sudden cancellations hurt their ability to redeploy the aircraft, leading to losses. “Airlines will have to shell out a substantial amount to passengers as compensation,” said an airline executive.Rajesh Bali, managing director of Business Aircraft Operator Association, said that the extra restriction on business jets is concerning as corporate leaders who rely on private jets for their travel needs already had limited slots to operate. “The new restrictions will significantly hamper business aviation operations, affecting the functionality of Mumbai as the commercial hub of the nation,” he said.Air traffic has increased exponentially after COVID with passenger traffic surpassing pre-pandemic records. But every major airport has seen severe congestion, leading to public outcry.Aviation security regulator BCAS has mandated that any addition of new flights at airports has to be based on passenger-handling capacity at security checkpoints. BCAS has set a standard saying that each X-ray machine can handle a maximum of 180 passengers per hour on the domestic side and 160 passengers on the international side.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/government-asks-mumbai-airport-to-reduce-flights-to-ease-congestion/articleshow/107637339.cms,1

Many such stocks driven up by speculative buying without consideration for the fundamentals are correcting. This trend is likely to continue since many such stocks are excessively valued,  said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. The explosive growth in the number of demat accounts and the newbies chasing mid and small caps influenced by recency bias have contributed to this froth in the broader market. A correction in this segment is inevitable and desirable. Correction will give opportunities to buy fairly valued stocks in this segment like PSU Banks,  Vijayakumar added.Deven Mehata, Research Analyst at Choice Broking, said,  Nifty can find support at 21,550 followed by 21,500 and 21,400.

Started in 1966 as a small textile manufacturer by Dhirubhai Ambani, RIL introduced the equity culture in India with its IPO in 1977.

On the same day, India's (or BSE's) market cap, too, crossed the Rs 20-lakh-crore milestone for the first time. RIL is now worth what all Indian companies put together were about 19 years ago. Its ability to grow and diversify at a fast clip at its scale has meant that its share in India's market cap is unchanged since 2005 at 5%. 107671558RIL, which has been the most valued company in India for over a decade, is now ranked (44th) among the world's top 50 companies in terms of market cap. RIL was also the first Indian company to reach the Rs 10-lakh-crore market cap mark on Nov 28, 2019. While it took 14 years to go from a market cap of Rs 1 lakh crore to Rs 10 lakh crore, the Rs 10 lakh crore to Rs 20 lakh crore journey needed just over four years.In India, RIL is ahead of TCS - the country's second most valued company - by Rs 5 lakh crore (see graphic). Among global oil & gas peers, RIL ($239 billion) lags Aramco ($2 trillion), Exxon Mobil ($410 billion) & Chevron ($287 billion) but beats Shell ($205 billion) and PetroChina ($202 billion), Bloomberg data showed. 107671603RIL grew during the the first 40 years with forward and backward integrations, like setting up refineries and petrochemicals plants. It then went into oil exploration. RIL entered the consumer retail space in 2006 and 10 years later, it launched telecom services. Through various subsidiaries, it also has a presence in areas like media, life sciences, green energy and logistics. In 2023, RIL demerged Jio Financial Services, which has a market cap of Rs 1.7 lakh crore.The promoters, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, hold a little over 50% in the company and the balance is held by funds and individuals. Boosted by his majority stake in RIL, Ambani has retained his position as Asia's richest person with a net worth of $109 billion. With nearly 35 lakh investors, RIL is among the most widely held companies in India.

The company added that it has accrued Rs 72.1 crore for bank guarantee commission and interest expenses for its share of bank guarantee and deposit as per the agreement.,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises has accused Walt Disney-owned Star India of violating the ICC TV rights agreement and has sought a refund of Rs 69 crore paid as part of the agreement.Zee asserted in its Q3 financial statements that it has strong grounds to counter Star India's claims in the ICC TV rights agreement matter. The company added that it has accrued Rs 72.1 crore for bank guarantee commission and interest expenses for its share of bank guarantee and deposit as per the agreement.Star India has sent letters to Zee through its legal counsel accusing the company of breaching the ICC TV rights agreement due to the non-payment of $203.5 million in the first installment of the rights fee along with the payment of the bank guarantee commission deposit of Rs 17 crore.Zee, on the other hand, has accused Star of failing to comply with the agreement due to its inability to obtain necessary approvals and execute necessary documents and agreements. The company claimed that the agreement was contingent on financial commitments, bank and corporate guarantees, and final ICC approval for the sub-licencing deal. The management believes that Star, by its conduct, has breached the Alliance Agreement and is in default of the terms thereof, and consequently, the contract stands repudiated,  Zee said in its note to the financial statements. The company said it has communicated to Star that the alliance agreement cannot be proceeded with for the reasons set out above and has also sought a refund of Rs 68.54 crore paid to Star,  it added.Zee said it doesn't anticipate any significant adverse impact from the contract repudiation, and there is no need to make any adjustments to the accompanying statement.On August 26, 2022, Zee signed an agreement to set out the basis on which Star India would sub-licence the ICC TV rights to the company for men's and u-19 events for four years until 2027.It is pertinent to note that the Walt Disney-owned company, which is in merger talks with Reliance Industries' Viacom18, had acquired the ICC media rights for $3 billion.As part of its pre-bid understanding with Zee, Disney Star had sub-licenced the ICC TV rights to the company for $1.5 billion. The company retained the ICC digital rights after acquiring the Indian Premier League (IPL) TV rights in the same year.Zee, which at that time was in the process of merging with Sony Group's India unit Culver Max Entertainment, had acquired the ICC TV rights since sports would have been a key focus area for the proposed Sony-Zee merged entity.Sony was expected to infuse growth capital of $1.5 billion into the merged entity, which would have been deployed for content investments in sports and digital.The merger, which had been in the works for two years, was called off by Sony last month due to Zee's apparent failure to meet the closing conditions.Zee's inability to stick to the ICC TV deal has meant that Star will have to service the entire $3 billion contract, which has put a strain on its valuation and is expected to dent its future profits.ET had reported that Reliance has reduced Star India's valuation by up to $2 billion due to anticipated losses from the ICC contract over the next four years.Star and Viacom18 are nearing the completion of a merger deal that values both entities at $4 billion each. Disney purchased Star for upwards of $15 billion as part of its $71 billion acquisition of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox in 2019.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/media/entertainment/zee-entertainment-seeks-rs-69-crore-refund-from-star-after-failed-icc-tv-deal/articleshow/107670174.cms,1

It is bigger than American giants like McDonald's, PepsiCo, Netflix, and Accenture. RIL is also the only Indian company among the world's 50 most valuable companies and is also one of the top candidates to become India's first $1 trillion stock.","With its market capitalisation growing at an average annual run rate of Rs 1 lakh crore in the last two decades, billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries is undoubtedly the largest wealth creator in the history of Dalal Street. After India's most valued stock touched the Rs 20 lakh crore milestone this week, it is now bigger than the likes of American MNC giants like McDonald's, PepsiCo, Netflix and Accenture.Shareholders of RIL, which was worth just Rs 1 lakh crore in August 2005, have made a notional profit of Rs 19 lakh crore in a span of less than 19 years.RIL hit the Rs 5 lakh crore m-cap feat in July 2017, Rs 10 lakh crore in November 2019, and Rs 15 lakh crore in September 2021 while the Rs 20 lakh crore landmark was achieved on 13 February 2024.     107712465With analysts expecting 2024 to be an eventful year for RIL as the past two years of investments move into the monetization phase, stock prices have jumped 28% in the last 3 months alone.The peerless conglomerate can't be compared to other listed or unlisted companies in India because it houses well-diversified businesses of petrochemicals, new energy, telecom and retail. In absolute terms, the stock is nearly double of HDFC Bank and roughly 3 times the size of ICICI Bank and Infosys.Mukesh Ambani fuelling India’s $1 trillion dreamIn US dollar terms, RIL is worth around $241 billion and is the only Indian company to feature in the list of world's 50 most valuable companies. At No. 42, it is bigger than American giants like PepsiCo, McDonald's, Shell, Cisco, Walt Disney, Netflix and Accenture, shows data from Companies Market Cap (as on 14 Feb 2023).Tata Consultancy Services or TCS, which is India's second largest company, is worth about Rs 15 lakh crore and at No.66 on the list of world's biggest companies. HDFC Bank (Rs 10.6 lakh crore) is the third and last Indian stock which finds a place in the world's top 100 list.Also read | Mukesh Ambani, Sunil Mittal may deal with an unfinished agenda after Lok Sabha electionsWhile RIL looks like a colossus on Dalal Street, it is worth just 8% of the largest stock on Wall Street. Globally, there are seven $1 trillion stocks, with Saudi Aramco (listed in Saudi Arabia) being the only non-American stock in the elite club.Valued at $3 trillion, Microsoft is the most valued company on earth after snatching the crown from Apple ($2.8 trillion) recently.Others in the $1 trillion club are Alphabet (Google), Nvidia, Amazon and Meta Platforms (Facebook).The hunt for India's first $1 trillion stock shows that there are three candidates - HDFC Bank, RIL and Bajaj Finance. Calculations done by ICICI Securities shows that RIL could make it by 2032 if its profit growth trajectory jumps up to about 21% against 10-year PAT CAGR of 13%, assuming no PE re-rating. The macro framework is based on the assumption of reaching peak corporate profitability (~7% ‘PAT/GDP’ ratio) in the listed space driven by gradual advancement towards peak GDP growth of ~9%. Other key assumptions include – ratio of the largest stock’s m-cap to aggregate m-cap sustaining at long-term average of 5-6% and no re-rating in P/E ratios from current levels,  said Vinod Karki of ICICI Securities.Based on the historical average number of companies with market value greater than a-tenth of the top company’s m-cap, it is likely that around 30-40 stocks with $100 billion size may exist in 2032, he said.What's next for RIL?RIL's Q3 results showed that its capex at $3.6 billion fell 22% quarter-on-quarter to 2-year-low as Jio's capex declined on completion of 5G pan India rollout. Retail capex was also low on muted new store rollout. We think investment cycles will be shorter than in the past two decades, with limited impact on balance sheet leverage. The key to watch will be the startup of revenues from the new energy vertical, which we believe remains most underappreciated in NAV,  Morgan Stanley's Mayank Maheshwari.A turn in the chemical cycle, a golden age for refining, traction in 5G subscribers and a slowdown in investments in retail could be among key events that garner investor traction, he said.RIL will also benefit from its robust free cash flow generation of Rs 30,000 crore in FY25, declining capex levels to Rs 1.25 lakh crore and declining debt levels to Rs 2.72 lakh crore. Commencement of new energy operations will be a key event in coming quarters for RIL, analysts say.It is expected that Jio may opt for a tariff hike after the Lok Sabha elections while retail will see revenue per square foot improving as store additions slow and older stores mature.If RIL becomes India’s first $1 trillion stock, the personal wealth of the Ambani family will also zoom as they own more than half of the conglomerate.(Data: Ritesh Presswala)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The potential deal would strengthen Reliance's presence in India's television distribution sector and expand the reach of its streaming platform, JioCinema. Tata Play, owned by Tata Sons and Temasek, faces competition from Netflix, Hotstar, JioCinema, and Amazon Prime.","Reliance Industries is reportedly in discussions to acquire a 29.8% stake in Tata Play, a subscription-based satellite TV and video streaming service, from Walt Disney, Business Standard newspaper reported citing sources close to the development.The potential deal signifies Mukesh Ambani-owned Indian oil-to-telecom conglomerate's strategic move to strengthen its presence in India's television distribution sector and expand the reach of its OTT platform, JioCinema.Tata Play did not respond to ET Online's query on this development.Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata group, currently holds a majority 50.2% stake in Tata Play, with the rest of the shares owned by Temasek, a Singapore-based fund. ET had reported in October last year citing sources aware of the development that Singapore-based investment firm Temasek is in advanced talks with the Tata Group to sell its 20% stake in Tata Play to the Indian conglomerate that owns the largest stake in the direct-to-home (DTH) company.However, no agreement was reached.If the negotiations between Reliance and Tata Play prove successful, it would mark the first collaboration between the Tata group and the Ambanis. Additionally, it would expand the reach of JioCinema, Reliance's streaming platform, to Tata Play customers. Disney had initially planned to divest its shares during Tata Play's IPO, but with the postponement of the listing, it began exploring other exit strategies.Sources familiar with the matter said that Reliance aims to offer its entire JioCinema content catalog to Tata Play customers upon acquiring the stake. I think if this is true, it does make sense for Reliance because they are already present on the MSO (multiple-system operator) side through Hathway and DEN, but DTH side they don't have presence,  Karan Taurani, analyst at Elara Capital, told ET Online.  In the current market environment, MSO side is losing market share to DTH, which has got a more premium customer base compared to MSO in terms of ARPUs. So, DTH has a protected base with the premium customer base and that will augur well for JioCinema to tie up and reach out to a larger subscriber base,  he said, adding it will also limit the competitive intensity for Reliance that has bundled offerings.Bankers are currently assessing the value of Disney's stake in Tata Play, Business Standard reported citing sources. Despite its significant presence in the market, satellite television broadcaster Tata Play faces challenges from competing streaming platforms like Netflix, Hotstar, JioCinema, and Amazon Prime. In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, Tata Play reported a loss of Rs 105 crore on revenue of Rs 4,499 crore, contrasting with the previous year's profit of Rs 68.60 crore on revenue of Rs 4,741 crore.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/media/entertainment/media/reliance-in-talks-to-buy-30-tata-play-stake-from-disney-to-strengthen-television-distribution-jiocinema/articleshow/107707411.cms,1

The index has been making a higher high both on daily and weekly charts.","Domestic equity indices recovered from a weak start to finish higher for the sixth session in a row on Tuesday, led by banking and financials, with the benchmark Nifty50 hitting a record high for the second session in a row.The NSE Nifty 50 index rose 0.42% to end a little below 22,200. The index ended 0.34% higher at 22,197, while the S&P BSE Sensex gained 0.48% to 73,057.Here's how analysts read the market pulse: The daily bullish candle confirms the strong outlook while the hourly chart, with higher highs and higher lows, suggests that the primary trend remains strong. The next rally would likely attempt to reach the 22,300-22,350 zone. However, the India VIX, the fear gauge, ended higher and closed at 16.07 level,  said Om Mehra, Technical Analyst, SAMCO Securities.Rupak De, LKP Securities, said,  Nifty continues its upward momentum following a consolidation breakout on the daily chart. The trend remains robust as it has sustained itself both above the psychological level of 22,000 and the 21EMA on the daily timeframe. On the higher end, it may move towards 22,400/22,600 once the index decisively surpasses the 22,200 mark. Support on the lower end is identified at 22,000.

The index has been making a higher high both on daily and weekly charts.The short-term trend of the Nifty remains up.

Indian law bars private companies from setting up nuclear power plants but allows them to supply components, equipment and sign construction contracts for work outside of the reactors. New Delhi has not met its nuclear power capacity addition targets for years mainly because it could not procure nuclear fuel supplies. However in 2010, India struck a deal with the United States for supplies of reprocessed nuclear fuel.

Most havent moved far for more than a month, vessel tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show. The build-up started when ships carrying the crude to ports around the Indian coast came to a halt late last year and then turned back towards the South China Sea as December drew to a close.","Nearly 15 million barrels of Russia’s Sokol crude — meant for delivery to India — are sitting on tankers idling off the coasts of Malaysia and South Korea. They show little sign of moving.Twelve tankers are anchored, holding the key Russian crude grade. Most haven’t moved far for more than a month, vessel tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.The build-up started when ships carrying the crude to ports around the Indian coast came to a halt late last year and then turned back towards the South China Sea as December drew to a close. Since then, the stranded shipments have been added to at a rate of about two new cargoes a week.It looked like the situation was starting to ease earlier this month, with three cargoes heading back to the south Asian nation. While a fourth is now signaling its destination as the Indian east coast port of Visakhapatnam, most remain stuck. And more continue to arrive, with an average of one 700,000 barrels cargo loaded onto specialized shuttle tankers at the De Kastri export terminal every three to four days.Those shuttle ships are piling up off the South Korean port of Yeosu, where they normally offload their cargoes onto other vessels for onward shipment to India. The hold-up could soon start to curb the pace of exports, if the shuttle tankers aren’t freed up soon to take on fresh cargoes.The fleet of seven ships, the most recent of which were delivered to Russia’s Sovcomflot PJSC from South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries shortly after Moscow’s troops invaded Ukraine almost two years ago, were specifically designed for the job of hauling Sokol crude. Ice resistant, with a shallow draft and a bow-loading manifold that allows them to take on cargoes from the offshore terminal at De Kastri, they can’t be replaced with other ships.All seven of those ships are now holding cargoes. Four were anchored off Yeosu for at least a week, but three departed for Chinese ports over the weekend, as the need to free up the vessels becomes more acute.Three Sokol cargoes have already been delivered to ports in the north of China this month. That’s up from the normal level of one or two cargoes a month taken by the country’s refiners.Reopening IndiaIndian sources have given different reasons for the disruption to supplies.Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said in January that refiners reduced oil imports from Russia as discounts on cargoes weren’t attractive, dismissing the notion flows dropped because of payment-related challenges.That view has been echoed by refiners themselves, with a person familiar with the operations of one processor saying that it has no plans to purchase Sokol as there is a premium of $2-$3 barrel compared with Urals, which means it doesn’t make any commercial sense to buy.However, Puri subsequently said that enforcement of a price cap imposed on Russian oil exports by the Group of Seven nations, along with challenges with shipping, had hampered some deliveries of Sokol to India.With Sokol trading above $70 a barrel, shipments of the grade are being keenly tracked by the US Treasury, which has begun taking a tougher line on sales of Russian crude that breach the cap.Several, but not all, of the Sokol cargoes that turned away from India were carried on vessels that had either been named explicitly on US sanctions list, or were managed by SUN Ship Management D Ltd., a company owned by Sovcomflot that’s been sanctionedIn the case of other cargoes, banks declined payment due to lack of clarity on ownership and the price exceeding the cap, according to market analytics firm Kpler and several Indian oil refinery officials.Recent deliveries of Sokol crude to India suggest that some of those difficulties have been overcome, at least for a handful of refiners.After Washington tightened sanctions, India’s banks have become much more cautious. They are demanding attestation from Indian refiners that the crude was purchased below the price cap and not carried on a sanctioned ship, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.Nayara Energy Ltd, part-owned by Russia’s Rosneft PJSC, received a cargo at its Vadinar import terminal on Feb. 6. Another was delivered on Feb. 15 to Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd’s refinery at Mumbai. The HCPL cargo was purchased through a trading company, rather than direct from the producer, according to a source familiar with the deal.A third tanker full of Sokol is now anchored off the port of Visakhapatnam, where HCPL also has a refinery and a fourth is heading to Sikka, the discharge location for Reliance Industries Ltd’s refinery. Sikka is adjacent to Vadinar and it’s not uncommon for ships to change their signals as they get closer.India is Sokol’s largest buyer and the grade accounts for about 10% of its total imports from Russia. Unless Sokol imports are normalized, India’s shipments from Russia are unlikely to hit the 2.1 million barrels a day reached last spring.There is still no clarity whether transferring cargoes onto unsanctioned tankers will unlock the Sokol trade to India. But one thing is clear, Indian refiners are in not rushing back yet.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/energy/oil-gas/russias-crude-oil-delivery-problems-to-india-arent-over-yet/articleshow/107835883.cms,1

Reliance Industries Ltd., controlled by Asia’s richest person Mukesh Ambani, has been looking to list its wireless carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. and Reliance Retail Ventures for several years, while the financial services unit of Tata Sons, another giant conglomerate, is one of several shadow lenders that the Reserve Bank of India has told to list before 2025. Hyundai Motor Co. is also considering listing its Indian business in one of the country’s biggest IPOs, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. India’s equity markets have been on a tear — the benchmark Sensex has risen in all of the past eight years, including a 19% rally in 2023 — and the retail investor base in the world’s most populous country is growing. A robust economy also provides favorable conditions for IPOs and exit opportunities for investors. The International Monetary Fund expects India’s economy to grow 6.5% in 2024 and 2025 following its 6.7% expansion last year. This is unfolding as neighbor China tries to address ructions in its stock and property markets, along with trade conflicts and various regulatory crackdowns. That’s further encouraging global investors to shift billions of dollars into India.“Every single private equity fund that you talk to wants to have a China plus strategy, so you’ll see at least two, three funds being raised for India alone,” said Purohit, who has worked in investment banking for over two decades. India should be regarded as a standalone market rather than an extension or part of the wider Asia Pacific, according to Purohit.

The Nifty50 had gained as much as 0.24% in the first hour of the trade to hit a record high for the third session in a row, before reversing gains in the final hours.Here's how analysts read the market pulse: For day traders now, 22,150/73,000 would act as a crucial resistance zone. As long as the market is trading below the same, the weak sentiment is likely to continue. Below which, the index could retest the level of 21,935-21,900/72,300-72,200. On the flip side, above 22,150/73,000 the sentiment could change. Above 22,150/73,000, the index could move up till 22,250-22,300/73,300-73,500,  said Shrikant Chouhan, Kotak Securities.Rupak De, LKP Securities, said,  The momentum indicator RSI is showing a bearish crossover, signalling weakness in the near term. Immediate support is positioned at 22,000; a decisive drop below this level could lead the index towards 21,700. On the upside, resistance is identified at 22,160. That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Thursday's action:US marketWall Street dipped on Wednesday as investors braced for chip designer Nvidia's high-stakes earnings report that could hinder this year's AI euphoria if results are not stellar, and awaited minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.Nvidia shed 1.2% after a more than 4% decline in the prior session ahead of the semiconductor firm's quarterly earnings, expected after markets close on Wednesday.Five of the 11 major S&P sectors eased in early trading, with rate-sensitive technology stocks down 1%.At 9:40 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 104.68 points, or 0.27%, at 38,459.12, the S&P 500 was down 10.96 points, or 0.22%, at 4,964.55, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 69.03 points, or 0.44%, at 15,561.76.European sharesEuropean shares slipped on Wednesday following a batch of disappointing earnings reports from companies including HSBC and JDE Peet's, while investors look out for region-wide consumer confidence data.HSBC shares tumbled 7.1%, set for their biggest one-day drop since March 2020, after the company's annual profit missed estimates. The broader banks index also fell 0.8%.The pan-European STOXX 600 index dropped 0.2%, bogged down by a 0.9% loss in healthcare stocks, which eased from a ten-month high hit in the previous session.Tech View: Bearish engulfing patternNifty on Wednesday ended 142 points weaker to form a bearish engulfing pattern on the daily chart, indicating a potential pause in the ongoing rally.The bullish chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms continued as per the daily timeframe chart and Wednesday's swing high of 22,249 could now be considered as a new higher top of the sequence. Hence, short-term weakness could be expected and the next lower supports to be watched at 21,850-21,750 levels, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.Stocks showing bullish biasMomentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade on the counters of ABB India, Clean Science & Technology, Alembic Pharma, Sunteck Realty, HFCL, FDC among others.The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices.

The attacks in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels have disrupted fuel trade, impacting Indian refiners and potentially eroding their competitive edge.","India’s state-run refiners are facing a shift in fortunes as once cheap Russian oil becomes more expensive and less accessible, squeezing profits for companies that had been benefiting from Moscow’s war in Ukraine.Attacks in the Red Sea have driven up freight rates, while tougher US sanctions have stranded some Russian cargoes destined for India, adding to costs. That may force some processors to buy more pricey barrels from suppliers in the Middle East, eroding profit margins even more, say traders and analysts.India has to import 88% of its crude needs and the nation took advantage of cheaper Russian oil following the war in Ukraine as others shunned Moscow’s barrels. But the trade, which has helped put the state-owned refiners on track for a rebound in net income this year, is under pressure.107905419Gross refining margins for processors including Indian Oil Corp. dropped in the previous quarter due to higher freight rates, said Hardik Shah, director at credit ratings and analytics firm CareEdge Group. The company estimates lower margins for refiners so far this financial year, but they are still higher than pre-war levels.The state-run processors primarily sell fuel domestically and don’t get the benefit of higher prices overseas, unlike the export-focused private processors including Reliance Industries Ltd. — which also have more flexibility on buying and payments for Russian crude.Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment on margins.CareEdge predicts overall margins should hold around $10 a barrel, as long as crude prices stay below $90, a level that global benchmark Brent hasn’t been above since October. Futures traded near $83 on Thursday.107905816The attacks on shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels have also spilled into global fuel trade. Arrivals of fuel from India to Europe averaged just 18,000 barrels a day in the first two weeks of February, a plunge of more than 90% compared with January’s average, according to Vortexa Ltd.The disruptions will likely lead to some impact for Reliance and and Nayara Energy Ltd., although they still have export options across Asia and Africa. Cheaper Russian oil has allowed India’s refiners to be more competitive than their peers in South Korea, Singapore and across the world.If India loses the Russian advantage on crude, whatever marginal refining edge it had will be gone, according to Mukesh Sahdev, the head of oil trading and downstream research at Rystad Energy.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/energy/oil-gas/russias-disrupted-oil-trade-crimps-margins-for-indian-refiners/articleshow/107904419.cms,1

Even in our Hindu religion, it is said that Shri Ram helped and took care of Jatayu. Shri Ram also took care of a small squirrel and it too blessed him in return."" 108021207Anant further shared that in Hinduism every deity has an animal that is close to them, and the concept of their vahana. He also said that he sees God with animals. ""Mata Rani sits on a lion, Goddess Laxmi likes owls, Saraswati's Vahan is a peacock... For Shri Krishna, it is often said-- hathi, ghoda, palki, jai kanhaiya lal ki! In Hindu dharma it is also said that animals are sacred to us and they represent Gods and Goddesses,"" he said.Meanwhile, in an interview with CNN-News18âs Anand Narasimhan, Anant revealed that they have over 200 rescued elephants from all across India at Vantara, where they are being taken care of by over 300-400 professionals. They also have 50-60 endangered species kept at Vantara.""Yes, that we've been rescued. From various backgrounds, like circuses, road accidents, animal-human conflicts, from zoos that are overcrowded. We have rescued animals from all across, from hunting lodges in South Africa and from other places. So while we were rescuing them, I thought that we needed a state-of-the-art hospital. We need a state-of-the-art facility. I donât want to keep them in cages. I want to keep them in their natural habitat... We have mimicked the natural habitat to the T, to the best of my ability. And my team is more important than me. Thereâs a trust, and the trust runs it. So the team has created a wildlife sanctuary, and each enclosure has its biodiversity, from the plants to the water body to even the rocks. The logs are originally from where the animals came from. Our focus is that India should not have any wild animals suffering in captivity, or any wild animals should not go without being treated,"" Anant told CNN-News18.Talking about his vision for Vantara, Anant further said in the interview, ""My vision is that at Vantara in Jamnagar, we would like to be the worldâs most advanced wildlife institute and we would also like to conserve and breed critically endangered species so we can release them back in the habitat. Because a lot of species, even today, as we speak, are going extinct.""Vantara is a not-for-profit endeavour that is said to house over 10,000 people at its rescue center. It is being run under the leadership of Anant Ambani, who is all set to tie the knot with Radhika Merchant on July 12, 2024. Meanwhile, their three-day pre-wedding celebrations will be held at Jamnagar in March. As per reports, some business and tech elites from across the world including Bill Gates, Melinda Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, among other will attend the pre-wedding celebrations.

The company faces weakened competitive position, reduced bargaining power, tough competition from digital media, and corporate governance issues. Zee shares have lost 44% of their value this year.","With billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries (RIL) and Viacom18 joining forces with Disney to create a Rs 70,000 crore worth broadcast network, debt-ridden Zee Entertainment Enterprises will now have a tougher time finding an investor that can compete with India's richest tycoon. Zee, which has already been struggling since its merger breakdown with Sony, should be negatively impacted by the creation of a larger entity. Both content producers and advertisers are likely to gravitate towards the RIL-Disney entity, which will also cater to the largest set of audience, further weakening its overall competitive position,  said Pulkit Chawla of Emkay Global.Jio's marketing muscle would also make it more difficult for Zee to grow, he said, adding that the Disney deal leaves Zee with a lesser number of suitors, thus further lowering its bargaining power.Sony is said to have withdrawn the agreement to merge its India operations with Zee, taking the final step in scrapping a two-year-old plan that sought to create a $10 billion media giant, Bloomberg reported earlier in the day.Given the structural risk from digital and OTT platforms, analysts say companies that do not participate in consolidation face a risk of marginalization. Prima facie, this consolidation is negative for Zee, Sony and Sun. Separately, reduced competition in sports would likely weigh on monetization of IPL media rights in the next auction (2028)—negative for IPL franchisees in the long term,  said Jaykumar Doshi of Kotak Equities.Also read | Reliance shares rally but TV18, Network18 fall 5% as investors react to Ambani-Disney dealThe Disney JV will be controlled by RIL and owned 16.34% by RIL, 46.82% by Viacom18, and 36.84% by Disney.

The combined accounts for 40% market share in linear TV and OTT advertising markets combined. It can consolidate the ad inventory across all cricketing events and monetize better with lower competition. It is also looking at better monetization via customized ads on its FTTH + FWA broadband platform wherein it is bundling content and internet access at Rs 100/month premium to what competitors are charging for internet access only,  Jefferies said.Viacom18 has a portfolio of 40 channels and an OTT platform – JioCinema. Viacom18 Studios produces and distributes Hindi and regional films in India. Star India has a reach of over 700 million viewers and an OTT platform – Disney+ Hotstar.The JV will also be granted exclusive rights to distribute Disney films and productions in India, with a license to more than 30,000 Disney content assets.On the other hand, Zee is facing stiff competition from digital media and has reported muted growth/profitability performance in the past two years. Its revenue growth has converged (flat in FY20-23) and an EBITDA margin dipped to 10.7% due to losses in the OTT segment and lower growth in the linear TV segment.Corporate governance is another issue as markets regulator Sebi has found fund diversion worth Rs 2,000 crore in Zee's books.

Reliance controls over 60% of the new entity, securing a powerful position in India's entertainment market. The joint venture gains exclusive rights to distribute Disney content in India and marks a significant boost for Reliance's streaming platform, Jio Cinema","Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani has signed a binding agreement with Walt Disney Co. to form an $8.5 billion media giant through a merger of their operations in the country, securing a dominant position in one of the world’s fastest-growing entertainment markets.Ambani’s oil-to-telecoms conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd. will control over 60% of the new unit — 16% directly and 47% via the Viacom18 Media Pvt. Ltd. business it largely owns — while 37% goes to Disney, said a joint statement issued late Wednesday by the companies.Reliance will invest another 115 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) in the new unit as growth capital and Disney may contribute certain additional assets after getting regulatory approvals. The joint venture, which creates the largest player in the local broadcasting and digital sector, will get exclusive rights to distribute Disney films and productions in India, along with a license to more than 30,000 Disney content assets.The binding pact, which Bloomberg reported on Feb. 25 had been signed, secures Reliance’s position in Asia’s biggest entertainment market, especially after a rival merger between Japan’s Sony Group Corp. and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. collapsed last month. Disney had initially pursued a far higher valuation for its India arm in merger talks, and the final deal reflects Ambani’s clout in a landscape that the American giant struggled to navigate on its own. “The overall value reflects a significant reduction in Disney’s valuation,” that was estimated to be as much as $17 billion when Disney purchased 21st Century Fox in 2019, Pulkit Chawla, a sector analyst with Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. wrote in a report Thursday. “The deal, however, would hurt other industry players like Zee, as they would have to compete with a much larger entity.”Reliance shares rose as much as 1.6% in Mumbai during trading, the most in two weeks, while Zee slipped as much as 2.9%. Other local media stocks were fell on Thursday.Intense competition and fragmented viewing habits — demand for regional language content, for example — has made it challenging for foreign streaming platforms like Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc’s Prime Video to see the success they’ve had in other markets.Streaming PotentialThe deal is a massive boost for Reliance’s streaming platform, Jio Cinema, as it can now offer Disney-Star India’s content library alongside its traditional sports broadcasting lineup. Reliance and Disney have been rivals, with the Indian company outbidding the American one in 2022 for rights to the Indian Premier League, the $6.2 billion cricket juggernaut.

The IPRS, which claims to be an unsecured creditor of both entities, had contended that the two parties had gone ahead with the scheme of arrangement without its consent.The NCLT had ruled that postponing or staying the scheme's process based on IPRS' claims would not be appropriate as its locus to object to the scheme had not been established.It also said that the proposed scheme provides sufficient scope for IPRS' interests to be protected in the event its credentials as a creditor get established.The IPRS has claimed dues of Rs 128 crore from Star India and Novi Digital Entertainment for the period April 2018 to March 2023 as per its published tariff.On February 21, the NCLAT reserved its judgment after hearing the counsels of Star India, Novi Digital Entertainment and IPRS in full. It also asked the parties to submit their notes of submissions and citations to the office of the registry through e-filing within three working days.As per the scheme of arrangement, Novi Digital Entertainment will get amalgamated into Star India, a move that will help the Walt Disney-owned company achieve economies of scale, enable synergies, increase operational efficiencies, put a greater emphasis on growth, make the best use of resources and lower costs.In meetings held on February 8, 2023, the boards of both Star India and Novi Digital Entertainment accepted the merger plan with effect from April 1, 2022.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/media/entertainment/nclt-adjourns-hearing-on-star-india-novi-digital-merger/articleshow/108092690.cms,2

Additionally, RIL will inject ₹11,500 crore ($1.4 billion) cash into the JV for its growth strategy. With this fund infusion, RIL's total investment in the media business amounts to ₹22,000 crore in the past year. In April 2023, it had invested over ₹10,839 crore as part of a ₹15,145 crore fund injection in Viacom18 that saw Bodhi Tree Systems invest ₹4,306 crore.

He had led Star under both Fox and Disney before calling it quits in December 2020.Based on the shareholding in the joint venture, Viacom18's stake is valued at approximately $4 billion, while that of Star is slightly over $3 billion, a far cry from the $15 billion that it once commanded.

Reliance will be the senior partner and the deal aims to leverage Reliance's understanding of the Indian market. The partnership will create a media powerhouse in India.,"NEW DELHI: The Walt Disney Co. announced Wednesday a joint venture with India's biggest conglomerate, Reliance Industries, in an $8.5 billion deal that will create a media powerhouse in the world's most populous nation and end Disney's decadeslong solo effort to gain a foothold in the market. Reliance Industries, which is owned by Mukesh Ambani, India's richest person, will be Disney's senior partner in the deal. With $239 billion in market capitalization and rights to the wildly popular Indian Premier League cricket matches, Reliance is a juggernaut in the media landscape in India. Disney and Reliance already had a combined market share of about 40% to 45% in advertising and about the same fraction of streaming, giving them a big edge over competitors, said Karan Taurani, a research analyst at Elara Capital.  This will lead to better profitability because the content costs could come down  in both TV and streaming, Taurani said. As part of the deal, Disney will merge its Indian operations with those of Viacom18, a part of Reliance Industries. Reliance and Viacom18 will hold 63% of the new venture, and Disney 37%, the companies said in a statement. Reliance will pay $1.4 billion to consolidate its control. Nita M. Ambani, Mukesh Ambani's wife, will be the chair of the joint venture; the vice chair will be Uday Shankar, the former chair of Disney India.  Reliance has a deep understanding of the Indian market and consumer,  Bob Iger, Disney's CEO, said in a statement.  We're excited for the opportunities that this joint venture will provide to create long-term value.  Disney is one of the biggest companies in the world, valued at $200 billion; in India, though, it proved no match for the homegrown hero. Disney first came to India, now a country of 1.4 billion potential media consumers, in 1993 and found a distributor to broadcast some of its content. Along with India's market, Disney's ambitions grew. Last year, accounting and consulting firm EY estimated that India's media landscape would be worth $30 billion this year and $100 billion by 2030. And Disney banked on bringing hundreds of millions of subscribers to its own streaming services. Disney's adventures in India were at their high point in 2019, when it bought 21st Century Fox from the Murdoch family's News Corp. Among Fox's assets, Disney won TV and streaming rights to the Indian Premier League cricket matches. Big subscriber numbers followed but at great cost. At its pandemic-fueled peak, Disney+ had 162 million subscribers in India, but it was losing almost $500 million worldwide in pursuit of viewers. By summer 2022, its global operations had bled more than $11 billion since the purchase of Fox and launch of Disney+. That is when Disney ran into trouble. Reliance Industries snatched away the cricket rights in 2022 for nearly $3 billion. Disney lost 11.5 million Indian subscribers in short order, even as it gained 800,000 new ones in the rest of the world. Still, Disney is not abandoning India.  India remains a key market for the company and one of the strongest international growth markets of scale, and we are committed to ensuring a robust presence there,  Disney executives said in an email to employees Wednesday.When Reliance was started by Mukesh Ambani's father in 1958, it was a trading shop, mainly of polyester fiber. It grew into petrochemicals and now runs the world's largest oil refinery at the port in Jamnagar, on a remote bit of India's western coastline. Along the way, it got into telecommunications and other businesses, and in 2016 started a low-cost mobile network, Jio, which quickly became the world's third-largest. JioCinema, part of a growing family of Jio properties but a relatively small platform when India's streaming wars began, looks likely to become the new home for Disney's content in India. At one point another rival looked ready to emerge, as Japanese media giant Sony was seeking to expand its operations in India by buying Zee Entertainment. With Zee, India's first private cable-TV company, Sony would have been big enough to divide up the TV-and-digital market with Reliance and Disney. But Sony backed out of its deal with Zee on Jan. 22, frustrated by the founding family's insistence on maintaining control. Sony's breakup with Zee seems to have made things even harder for Disney. For one thing, Zee still owes Disney for cricket licensing. Bloomberg reported that the estimated value of Disney's India unit sank to $4.5 billion from $10 billion. Sony's failed merger also made the eventual Disney deal look sweeter for Ambani: What would have been a landscape defined by two giants is instead looking likely to be dominated by just one. Being such a sprawling conglomerate, Reliance has an advantage in the battles for media domination. It does not need content to pay for itself directly. When their subscribers are brought into their retail, telecom and credit operations, the cost of making shows looks small by comparison to combined revenue.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/media/entertainment/media/disney-to-step-back-from-india-in-mega-deal-with-reliance-industries/articleshow/108087431.cms,2

Many years ago, Warbrooke, a Kiwi by birth but with a cool quotient that is innately Californian, had flown into and camped for weeks in India’s financial capital to play matchmaker and close another strategic transaction for his firm — Walt Disney Co’s buyout of Ronnie Srewvala’s UTV Software Communications Ltd, in tranches starting 2006. He was a young executive then, but handles a senior role in Corporate and Business Strategy. A lot of time has lapsed between the two trades. Mumbai arguably is more polluted, a skyline that resembles a mashup between Singapore and Dubai but minus the infrastructure. Yet some things remain the same.If the UTV investment and subsequent buyout gave Walt Disney a chance to make a comeback after its first India tie up with KK Modi Group in 1993 went south, the merger with Mukesh Ambani’s flagship Reliance Industries is expected to give the US media giant, a fresh lease of life in Asia’s biggest streaming market after several missteps ranging from losses in sports to losing top talent. In retrospect, with the UTV deal also underachieving compared to what was originally envisaged, Disney-Reliance had to be a case of being third time lucky.ET spoke to several executives and officials to piece together all the action that played out behind the scenes of this $8.5 billion stock and cash corporate alliance that is no less racy than a thriller. Most spoke on condition of anonymity. The genesis was in the fall of 2023 and a climax just before the grand pre-wedding party for Ambani’s youngest son Anant in Jamnagar this weekend -- all in a span of five months or so. That’s in sharp contrast with another mega merger that took two years to be called off last month.Disney to the partyThe entire Disney top brass including chief executive Bob Iger, advisor Kevin Mayer, Walbrook and K Madhavan Country Manager and President, Disney Star in India are expected to attend the three day jamboree in Jamnagar as special guests. Interestingly, that is where the two main actors of this biggest media story playing across television screens and OTT platforms in India today -- Mukesh Ambani, the 66 yr old chairman of Reliance Industries, also the richest man of the country, and his peer Robert “Bob” Iger will meet in person for the first time ever since the negotiations between both sides began around last September. Both stayed away from the deal maths, manoeuvres or the merger minutiaes. Instead they sent two of their key lieutenants Manoj Modi and Mayers to hammer it out on the playing field.Mayer, once seen as Iger’s likely successor, especially after the launch of Disney+, who had worked closely with the CEO on a series of acquisitions and was a key architect of Disney’s streaming strategy before leaving the firm to start Candle Partners, also a media group, only to be cherry picked and parachuted back last July to “turn around” Disney after Iger was brought in 2022 and then given a 2 year extension to fix the behemoth that was broken in every corner – soaring expenses, furious fans of its once vaunted theme parks, striking screenwriters, dipping revenues, uneven performance of Lucasfilm and Disney’s animation and live-action releases and activist shareholders baying for blood.        108087044Mission IndiaMayer’s India mandate from Iger was simple: a holistic solution and not piecemeal slump sale of assets or businesses. An exit from one of the most promising markets that is consuming content on terabytes of free data was also out of the question.For both Mayer and his colleague Tom Staggs who also had left Disney to start Candle, with the backing of Blackstone, but brought back as Iger’s “advisors”, the world’s largest PE firm was an obvious pit stop. They have a sizable presence in India and had over the years scoped several media assets including Sony’s local operations, Airtel DTH, Dish TV and Eenadu; and had bought into Jagran Media Network. It had also weighed a co-investment with Star in Asianet for a minority stake, after Rupert Murdoch bought a controlling interest in the Kerala-based network from Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a former telecom-and-media business magnate and the current minister of state for electronics and information technology. Madhavan, himself was the managing director and CEO of Asianet at the time.In parallel, Madhavan too was talking to potential suitors including Carlyle to put together an investment consortium that would pump in at least a billion dollars and resuscitate Star India and consolidate his position, people aware said.But for any financial investor, this was a tough call with Jio changing the rules of the game by offering free streaming and cheap data. The financial returns were just not stacking up. “Media in India is also a highly regulated sector with sparring media conglomerates,” said an executive in the know on condition of anonymity. “Which PE firm would want to take on Reliance in India.” None of those conversations therefore moved ahead much. Return of the JediEnter Reliance.As talks progressed, Mayer had roped in Walbrooke, a rainmaker who now wears many hats -- head of international finance, CFO, direct-to-consumer business, and international head of business operations, to help him . Walbrooke, himself a company man, joined as a manager after a stint in consulting about two decades back, knew what his bosses and board were seeking. Once the broad contours were in place, it gathered momentum after Walbrooke visited the Reliance Mumbai office in October followed by Mayer and Modi catching up just before Christmas at the Ambani residence in Stoke Park, London, to shake hands and sign a non binding term sheet with a February 17th deadline.Both businesses too were to be treated as similar-sized ones, a far cry from Star India’s $15 billion valuation that was often thrown around after Murdoch family crown jewel was acquired in 2019.Meanwhile, bankers, the valuation specialists from the big and a bevy of lawyers were already tasked to draw out the finer points. By November, the structure too was also clear – create a step-down subsidiary of Viacom18 Media, which will absorb Star India via a stock swap to avoid significant equity dilution of existing partners of Viacom 18.Viacom18’s entertainment network in the country is a partnership between Ambani’s TV18 Broadcast, Paramount Global and Bodhi Tree Systems.The combined business also needed money largely on account of the mounting losses of Disney’s sports franchise in India after its jaw dropping Rs 23,575 crore IPL TV rights for the 2023-27 cycle. Iger was not over eager putting more cash at this juncture considering globally it only just about “turned a corner” in the quarter ending February 2024 and announced a $3 billion share buyback programme and a 50% dividend increase to soothe its investors' nerves. So Reliance Industries stepped in with a cheque of Rs 11,500 crore (~$ 1.4 billion). That made Reliance Group (including Viacom 18) the controlling shareholder with 63.16% shareholding.“Both Reliance, Disney are no pushovers. Both were looking at scale, and Disney retained a meaningful stake for future upside. This is a happy ending for both.” quipped a Reliance executive. “This is a merger but with unequal shareholding.”Two sides are putting equity instead of one buying the other out for cash. Even the junior shareholder will have rights, added a Disney executive, just before picking his wedding wardrobe for Ambani Junior and Radhika Merchant wedding nuptials with echoes of another union in the background.With Rihanna, AP Dhillon, Daljit Dosanjh performing in Jamnagar, you don’t want to forget your dancing shoes, do you?",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/media/entertainment/from-september-to-a-shaadi-how-disney-found-a-new-home-for-mickey-mouse-in-india/articleshow/108083395.cms,2

Analysts feel that the merger could be negative for smaller players in the space like Zee, Sony and Sun TV.""The JV will be a dominant player in the ecosystem, with an estimated 40% viewership share in linear TV, and over 50% share in digital, as JioCinema and Disney+Hotstar are by far the largest streaming platforms in the country,"" a report by UBS India said. RIL had said that the entity would have about 75 crore viewers across India. According to Jefferies, one of the leading foreign brokerages in India, the entities together now account for 40% market share in linear TV and OTT advertising markets combined.The UBS India report also said that according to an advertisement industry veteran, advertising cost could go up 20-25% after consolidation in the space. ""Bargaining power of the broadcasters (now fewer in number and larger in size) would increase at the cost of the advertisers,"" the report said.The Jefferies report also noted that the combined platform has ICC cricket broadcast and digital rights till 2027, digital rights for IPL till 2027 and media rights for BCCI domestic and international matches till 2027. ""It also owns rights for EPL and the Olympics. The Jio Cinema app, Viacom18's 40 linear TV channels along with Disney's 70 linear TV channels, make it the most prolific player in India's media space.""According to a Kotak Institutional Equities report, RIL's strong share in digital cable (Hathway + Den) and data consumption (Jio) augur well. ""Merger synergies would be significant owing to better pricing on advertising and subscription, especially in the case of sports and cost rationalisation,"" the report said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/reliance-industries-disney-deal-gets-thumbs-up-from-d-st/articleshow/108117729.cms,0

The merged entity will have over 70 channels from Star India, 38 TV channels from Viacom18, Jio Cinema, and Hotstar. It will control 75-80% of the Indian sports market in both linear TV and digital platforms.","New Delhi: The merger of the Indian media business of Walt Disney with Reliance Industries' Viacom18 will create a  significant dominant player , which might reduce the bargaining power for media buying agencies, the country's advertising industry has said. The Rs 70,000-crore behemoth, created post-merger may enable it to exert greater control over pricing and inventory of media rights and also influence over content, advertising industry leaders said.  According to the experts, the merged entity will almost have a monopoly in sports properties as it will collectively control 75-80 per cent of the Indian sports market, in both linear TV and digital platforms and may uptick the rates.  The joint venture, which is expected to receive approvals by the first quarter of 2025, will have over 70 channels from Star India and 38 TV channels from Viacom18 in eight languages, along with two large OTT platforms -- Jio Cinema and Hotstar -- and two film studios owned by each of them.   The Star-Viacom merger will substantially reduce the bargaining power of the media buying agencies,  Rediffusion Chairman Sandeep Goyal told PTI.  Last year, media buyers and clients reduced rates during the Indian Premier League (IPL), playing the broadcaster versus the digital rights holder, he said.   That will not happen now. This year, I think there will be an uptick in IPL rates,  Goyal added.  Expressing similar views, Dentsu South Asia CEO Harsha Razdan said this combination  heightens competition and enhances the negotiating power of the newly merged entity, enabling it to exert greater control over pricing and inventory .   Once it has cleared all industry-specific regulation protocols, the combination should create a significantly dominant player in the market, wielding substantial influence over content creation, distribution, and consumption trends,  he said.  According to a joint report from industry body Ficci and EY, the Indian advertising industry crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore-mark in 2022.  The report estimates the ad industry to grow at 11 per cent till 2025 and expects it to cross Rs 1.42 lakh crore by 2025, in which traditional media, such as TV, will have a 46 per cent contribution and the remaining 54 per cent will be from new age digital media.  Razdan further said the newly merged entity presents a dual prospect of opportunities and challenges for the advertising and marketing sector.  On the positive side, it provides extensive reach to the industry with its diverse portfolio of channels and platforms, but it also enhances the negotiating power of the newly merged entity.   I hope that in the coming years, the merger achieves a balanced outcome. It is crucial to maintain two or three major players in the market to foster a healthy and competitive environment, which ultimately should serve the end consumer,  he said.  Elara Capital Senior Vice-President, Karan Taurani said the monopoly in sports properties may lead to higher ad revenues of the merged entity.  Disney and Jio collectively control 75-80 per cent of the Indian sports market across both linear TV and digital platforms, he added.   This dominance in sports, primarily cricket, will help command a substantial share of the overall ad market, showcasing strong growth in an industry where sports is a key viewership driver for both linear TV and digital platforms,  said Taurani.  In CY22, sports advertising expenditure in the country stood at Rs 7,100 crore jointly for TV and digital, in which Disney India had a contribution of 80 per cent.  The combined entity will have lucrative sports properties, including the IPL (both TV and digital), ICC cricket tournaments (both TV and digital), Wimbledon, Pro Kabaddi League, and BCCI domestic cricket.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news//industry/services/advertising/viacom-star-merger-will-substantially-reduce-bargaining-power-says-advertising-industry/articleshow/108140634.cms,0
